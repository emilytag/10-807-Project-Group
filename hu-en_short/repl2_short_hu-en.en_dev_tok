30 % of police officers , 30 % of schoolteachers and 30 % of doctors have lost their jobs .
if we do not talk about world trade rules we will resolve nothing : that is to say , in the face of this systemic crisis we must reform the system , restoring to politics that steering role that is too often lacking , refocusing attention on the real economy and abandoning the easy opiates of virtual finance !
in the year in which we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the atlantic alliance , it is time to rethink its strategic concept and bring it into line with the new reality .
finally , it should be emphasised that the council has , in a certain sense , ratified parliament 's amendments while allowing for plenty of discussion on the social consequences both for employees of services and for consumers .
for this reason , i do not think that we need any new legislation in the field of energy ; instead , i think we should focus more on implementing the existing legislation .
we know that it is the most heavily militarised area in the world . we know that this also is an area where there are arrests and significant detention without trial .
the amendments that i and my fellow members proposed , and which were approved by a large majority in the committee on regional development , will allow the old member states , and not only the new ones , as the original draft proposed , to be able to benefit as well from this possibility of financing .
if necessary , the european union ought to be ready to continue this mediation .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , today , europe must face up to a new dimension of problems such as terrorism , cyber threats and trafficking in human beings and drugs .
with interruptions such as this , however , the debate becomes more interesting .
( sk ) madam president , i regard it as very important from a political perspective that the guidelines for the 2012 budget reflect the economic and political circumstances under which it was drawn up .
this first assessment of the national action plans is a point of reference for dialogue in the eu and a useful tool allowing the member states to turn the spirit of energy efficiency into pragmatic measures that will produce the expected results by 2020 .
the directive itself contains mechanisms to ensure the specificities of these services are taken into account .
composition of political groups : see minutes
in 1997 , this dutch entrepreneur was charged with breaching the polish taxation rules .
they will explain the obstacles they face .
at the heart of the three main challenges facing the european union , namely growth , employment and the recognition and satisfaction of people 's needs , are 490 million consumers .
i would say , now that the european union is a community of 27 member states and 480 million inhabitants , that management and administration need to be simplified and made more efficient .
the current sluggish handling of the situation clearly gives a sign of the weakness and inability of the organisation to adequately implement the goals it has set itself .
regarding the question of my presidency 's ambitions in relation to world trade liberalisation , the presidency has clearly defined its main priority on this subject in the context of the council 's 18 - month programme for the french , czech and swedish presidencies , as well as in its own work programme , which was published last week and was also introduced here to some extent by the prime minister today .
even if there is unanimity on the fact that there can be no return to unbridled developments on the financial market , the methods and extent of regulation are still the subject of fierce argument .
the european parliament , being the cautious budgetary authority that it is , remains within the agreed boundaries ( one fifth of the budget of the institutions ) , but invests in knowledge nevertheless , by increasing staffing levels within the groups and by increasing capacity in the library .
a global approach is totally consistent with the objective of protecting health and the environment more effectively while allowing for trade in products .
- ( sk ) we often hear it said these days that nobody can make a tree grow to the sky .
as i said , it is a bilateral matter which , of course , falls within the competence of the countries that are concluding these agreements .
finally , i wish to welcome the acknowledgement given to the role of the structural funds in achieving the strategy 's objectives .
to ensure that this authority runs smoothly and is properly integrated into the overall framework of financial regulation , it became necessary to amend regulation ( ec ) no 1060/2009 .
this is an important step and a positive development on their way towards european integration .
someone has to take the lead in tackling the issue , and it is quite naturally the european union 's place to take the lead .
the energy sector is an obvious example of this .
adapting to a dynamic economic reality also means ensuring a high level of protection of workers ' rights in close cooperation with social partners .
in the context of the present economic crisis , the revival of the eu economy has become a very important topic , and this will be achieved through sensible investments , which are vital to economic success , scientific discoveries , technological innovation and jobs .
however , i think that support from the european social fund must be based on solidarity .
continual retrenchment in police services at the same time as borders are being eliminated is counterproductive , and not only in this area .
consolidating tax bases at an eu level would not make the difference suggested by the rapporteur .
it is worth emphasising that such an order would only have a preventive effect .
adults and senior citizens who pass on knowledge and technical know - how to younger people , particularly expertise in a trade or in business practice , can play an effective supporting role .
i also think that we have learned a lot from what happened last year .
for these reasons , the commission does not envisage the implementation of 100 % scanning in eu ports .
but i fully understand their abominable behaviour .
the oral question to the commission by jan marinus wiersma , hannes swoboda , katalin lévai , adrian severin and jan andersson , on behalf of the pse group , on a european roma strategy ( o - 0081/2007 / rev. 1 - b 6-0389/2007 )
therefore , the defence of european farmers ' interests must be a priority , and i am pleased in this respect that the document includes some paragraphs guaranteeing reciprocity for european farmers by means of the request for the same requirements that are imposed on european farmers to be applied to exporters of meat to europe in order to guarantee consumer safety and fair commercial competition .
( sl ) in answer to mr pirker : it is a fact that procedures to include the swiss federation and the principality of liechtenstein in the schengen area have already begun .
a number of people were put in the dock and no new facts emerged .
at the summit , we must reiterate that the six - point agreement on georgia has still not been implemented .
i would remind you that the creation of a unitary patent will bring advantages for users of the patent system in europe and , in particular , it will allow small and medium - sized enterprises , which are often neglected , to improve their competitiveness through improved access to protection via the patent as well as a reduction in costs .
in coping with all these duties , the european union should not only preserve its strategic connection with nato but should also be able to make its intellectual and political contribution with regard to maintaining nato 's ability to deter , and its ability to defend member states against any aggression , in a context different from the one which determined the birth of the alliance .
we should also know that the report of the united nations special rapporteur speaks a very clear language .
micro - credit is also a very important means of improving the economic status and independence of women , not least for women from minority groups .
written declarations included in the register ( rule 123 ) : see minutes
at the same time , moody 's has downgraded greece 's credit rating to the same level as angola ; this was unwarranted and is unacceptable .
at the end of june a new eu - russia agreement is finally to be negotiated in siberia .
we also need to negotiate with russia in connection with issues relating to the partnership and cooperation agreements and energy security now that russia - wrongly , not rightly - has withdrawn from the energy charter .
consequences of the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon for ongoing interinstitutional decision - making procedures (
if it can happen in australia within two hours , then one day should be entirely feasible in europe .
this leads to many wrong decisions , especially by those less well off .
( el ) mr president , commissioner , mrs batzeli and mr deß , we all know that the proposed amendments to the regulation on the cmo in sugar aim to make participation in the community sugar industry more attractive under the restructuring regime so as to achieve the target of reducing community sugar production .
if not , our ship owners will be put at an unfair competitive disadvantage , and the objectives of preservation and sustainable management of fisheries resources will be seriously compromised .
mr president , i greet you on behalf of a small american republic , in which just over 4.5 million people dare every day to live and to dream ; in which the ideal of a society without an army has been possible , and in which we will soon be celebrating 110 years of democracy .
mr president , this is an important dossier , and i am disappointed that the council is not here , because it now has a crucial role to play as the direction of its thinking is , i understand , rather different from that of this parliament .
the trade preferences were granted for a period ending on 31 december 2010 and cover the following countries : bosnia and herzegovina , serbia and kosovo .
( pl ) mr president , i am one of the members of this house who will not be congratulating you on the success of this six - month presidency .
( lv ) thank you , mr president .
the euro exchange rate with the dollar and sterling is not softening and not likely to soften with the divergence between the us and euro interest rates .
we hope that this initiative will promote constructive dialogue on the matter .
mr gbagbo should go away .
that shortage is already having and will continue to have serious effects on the prices of milk and hence milk products , as well as on the prices of various other food products .
he said that the canadian government would also promise increased political monitoring and a greater military presence in canadian arctic waters .
this mismatch between word and deed will prove fatal to the european union unless radical changes are made to our policy and attitudes .
commissioner , you have , furthermore , not provided a very detailed answer to the question relating to funding and potential compensation for the airlines .
specifically with a view to meeting the challenges of globalisation , the european union must adhere to its core principles , as the only way to safeguard its competitiveness in the long term .
i would very explicitly like to thank my fellow members , the shadow rapporteurs and , of course , mr florenz , the rapporteur , for their excellent cooperation , thanks to which we have been able to table a coherent text .
the european parliament also wanted to be informed about the commission 's intentions concerning staff redeployment to address the priorities of the new interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and , more particularly , those policies supported by parliament during the negotiations .
i would like to express one more wish for the future above and beyond the lisbon treaty .
it is , however , preferable to increase quotas even if only by 2 % than to make no changes at all .
what obstacles can the eu erect to prevent gambling operations in member states ?
transfers of defence - related products (
particular attention must be given to the victims of the most repressive cultural , social and political systems .
why not also give financial support to the gdańsk shipyard , which symbolises the end of the cold war and the liberation of the whole of central and eastern europe from the yoke of communism ?
i can guarantee that the revision will extend far beyond european principles on freedom of movement .
the one aspect that i really want to focus on is the recovery plan so far .
that was more or less its original raison d'être .
on this matter , as your resolution underlines , we have had a number of meetings at technical level with belarusian experts on matters of mutual interest , such as energy , transport and environment .
keeping to the budget is a philosophy common to parliament and the other institutions , and particularly during an election year we should avoid presenting the european institutions as excessively ambitious as regards the cost to the european taxpayer .
this statement bears testimony to the potential for misuse of the arrest warrant by the judiciary .
what can europe learn from this crisis ?
i wanted to mention this first .
i want to ask for calm from the parties .
they are the record unemployment of almost 20 % and a public deficit of almost 11 % in spain .
we must strive to prevent highly educated people from leaving their own countries in massive numbers , thereby causing economic damage , but it should certainly not be about opposing immigration into europe by definition .
in addition , this report ensures legal certainty for our entrepreneurs , who will know that for the next five years , european legislation will prevent the standard rate of vat from rising .
they bring an end to the impunity of owners of hulks , and inspections will be made even more effective by being targeted at such ships .
a strong europe , which is a europe that will cope with the global competitive environment , is achieved by maintaining the cohesion policy as a key element in eu policies , aimed at achieving balanced development in every region .
governance and partnership are two key issues in reviving the single market .
solving the political , economic and social issues can make the environment peaceful , less subject to inter - ethnic tension and able to reject the acts of violence that , tragically , we have seen become more frequent over the last decade .
even though this pathogen should not primarily be treated with antibiotics , we have the problem that it is resistant to many common antibiotics .
this is a reflection of the confidence in european institutions which exists in spain , and a reflection of the work we have done in spain .
without more rapid force generation , be it police , prosecutors , or military , it will be very difficult to act at the rhythm , at the speed , that is required in crisis management .
as regards the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , 2009 was a good year as regards its reform process .
( hu ) an ever - increasing number of scientists in the world are saying that a severe oil , water and food shortage will develop simultaneously by 2030 .
however , we must not forget that member states have voiced their opposition to such a directive because it does not come under the eu 's jurisdiction .
the greek communist party voted against this particular report , underlining that the only popular way out of the capitalist crisis is to target the profits of the monopolies .
i believe that the irish vote will have an important impact on the way in which we build europe , especially in the months to come , inasmuch as it proves the deep attachment of our peoples to the values which europe represents .
mr president , i should like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation and the work that we did together , as well as thanking the rapporteurs for the opinions of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , and of the committee on women 's rights and gender equality .
( cs ) ladies and gentlemen , in parliament i represent citizens of the czech republic , who were just mentioned .
this leads me , president - in - office , to call on you too to support the commitments we have made internationally with the iter , or fusion , project .
in countries where women have the right to choose abortion , this rate fluctuates at around 200 .
the situation will largely be resolved by amending national provisions to take account of developments .
mr president , as stated in the text of the oral question that we have tabled , in the last three years , we have seen an escalation of the situation detrimentally affecting european union interests and citizens in the southern sahara , which has become a haven for the islamic branch of al-qaeda , with a whole string of murders , kidnappings , extortion , blackmail , drug trafficking and people trafficking , the victims of which have been german , italian , spanish and , most recently , french citizens .
furthermore , the council has just started the examination of the commission 's action plan for the deployment of intelligent transport systems ( its ) in europe and the associated proposal for a directive laying down the framework for the deployment of intelligent transport systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport .
sometimes i get the impression that , when it comes to these issues , things happen in a similar way to the monitoring of the fishing quotas : each side pushes a little towards the other and there is not , in the end , an efficient system .
mr president , when my constituents ask me about the main benefit of being part of the european union , my reply is always the free trade that exists between nations and the internal market that we are seeking to complete .
an agreement on the regulation of risk capital , a regulation on the supervision of financial markets and a budget for 2011 .
we will compare notes on the g 20 results , especially financial and banking reforms and the need to deliver a global trade deal , and look for eu - us added value there .
i would like to stress that in combating this difficult disease , it is vital to pay much attention to prevention and to target efforts at obtaining the earliest possible diagnosis .
- report : liese
that was the conclusion reached by the european council in june 2006 , when it called on the european union and its member states to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development .
i shall tell you why .
there needs to be a differentiation between micro , small and medium - sized businesses .
conclusion of the statute of the international renewable energy agency ( irena ) (
is there something the commission can do - maybe by making a plea , at the next summit , to our national governments to show a bit of european solidarity ?
lumping all these services together , which is what repeatedly happens in this house , is risky , in my view .
member states will then be able to integrate in taxes or tolls levied the actual costs incurred by traffic - based air and noise pollution , whereas up to now , only infrastructure - related costs could be charged .
regulation of the transport of dangerous goods is important for our transport system .
at this time of year we start to hear of tragedies in which hundreds of migrants have drowned and since we well know what happens , it is good to ask whether we are better prepared this year to meet the challenge of illegal migration .
what we found in this institution from all spectrums , from left and from right , was that you gave us a forum when nowhere else gave us a voice to speak .
this is a truly european issue and now is not the time for national egoism .
concerning the question of the azores , the portuguese authorities have used any opportunity to ask for increased milk quotas for the islands because of the fact that the azores seem to be extremely competitive and seem to be benefiting from the increased production .
- ( fr ) madam president , excuse me , but i do not understand why there should be a time limit .
this is essential for reasons of competitive neutrality , and also because two thirds of co 2 emissions come from intercontinental flights rather than flights within europe .
the fight against corruption and aid for the poorest - that is our moral duty and a long - term interest of the eu .
however , a distinction must be made between purely bureaucratic matters and cases where rights may be called into question .
just as in the financial sector , the member states will not achieve any concrete results in supporting growth unless they cooperate closely with each other , and , beyond that , with their major international partners .
our role is to take care to ensure that our societies are safe .
mr frattini , the process to bring this to the house has been long and laborious , but there can be no doubt it will be well worth voting for the final result tomorrow .
agreement could have been reached .
the rapporteur sets as target 125 grams of co 2 per km in 2015 .
it is clear that we are tackling the effects of the problem and not the causes .
i would therefore like to state for the record that the amendment made to article 2 ( 2 ) ( a ) with the wording ' except wild game ' must always be considered in conjunction with point aa .
the ind / dem group was , of course , formed to oppose the european constitution , and we have been very successful , having spent money on the ' no ' campaigns in the french , dutch and , most recently , irish , referendums .
we have just entered trialogue and we already have a new legislative proposal from the commission , again to amend the regulation .
furthermore , maternity leave must be guaranteed for all women .
in order to attain this objective , the most isolated regions of the community , such as the baltic sea region , need to be better integrated into the european energy market .
congratulations and thanks to mrs ana maria gomes on the report .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
mr oettinger , you are in the process of drawing up the energy roadmap 2050 .
with regard to energy policy , we in the group of the greens / european free alliance also believe it is important not to forget human rights and to neglect the human rights dialogue when we discuss energy .
we are doing it because real peace can only be created when there is justice for the victims - and there are victims not just with pakistani or indian passports .
the commission proposed the inclusion of three modules .
typhoon morakot swept across the island with unbridled force , leaving more than 750 people dead .
( nl ) just like many other people , i also think there should be a statute for meps ' assistants as soon as possible .
the commission should launch infringement proceedings and penalties against member states that do not apply , or only partially apply , the regulations on the structural funds .
in addition , we need to inform citizens that infringements of eu law can be challenged before the national courts concerned as well .
we have included important proposals .
when a producer consciously uses the ce marking , he is saying that he abides by eu rules .
once again , history is repeating itself , in all its horror , on europe 's doorstep .
on the other hand , we have a very important signal .
( nl ) i , too , intended to vote in favour of the záborská report because it was , all in all , an even - handed report that does not lapse into the traditional , politically correct clichés when it comes to matters such as discrimination or what is meant by it .
it would be good if this could be corrected .
i would like to highlight the following absolutely essential aspects in specific areas : the urgent need to implement the single european sky in the aviation sector , the urgent need to implement interoperability in the railway sector , expanding and improving road infrastructures and safety on european roads in the road transport sector , achieving comodality in inland ports and expanding the ' motorways of the sea ' for sea and river transport , and the urgent need for the sustainable development of urban mobility .
encourage member states to adopt a system of ' opting out ' rather than ' opting in ' to organ donation .
i shall not mention the more specific aspects of the dispute settlement procedure described in the text of the amendment - mr botopoulos has in any case covered this aspect accurately and thoroughly .
it would have merited this and it would also reassure us that you think it is as important as you are now saying .
i am counting on the full support of both arms of the budgetary authority so that europe can swiftly provide the necessary aid to farmers , particularly those in africa , in close cooperation with the competent multilateral organisations .
unfortunately the current tax system in eu member states does not favour implementation of the lisbon strategy .
this is why i am actually encouraging the european investment bank to continue the measures aimed at promoting economic and social cohesion in the european union and the measures to combat the financial crisis by increasing ...
the countries in africa need to be able to see that the first measures are already in progress .
i am thinking , in particular , of the work undertaken by mrs ferreira .
i call on the commission to take this initiative .
achieving an agreement in copenhagen will give the necessary impetus for coordination at global level of the actions to be taken against climate change .
whilst reiterating , mr president , commissioner , fellow members , our desire and will to cooperate and always be on good terms with the commission , we have no choice but to reject the conduct to which i have referred .
in spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the european labour market , industrial and technological change increases the need for workers with high and intermediate skill levels .
mr itälä and mr fleckenstein have already referred to this .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , the idea of a one - stop shop is to be welcomed , but it is a paradigm shift for some european countries - including my own , austria , where residence permits are issued by the authorities dealing with third - party rights and work permits by the authorities responsible for the labour market , the austrian employment service , with the involvement of the social partners .
nevertheless , in making changes to frequency spectrum policy , we must also bear in mind international agreements on the freeing up of different frequencies at an international level .
that is a second observation that we will perhaps have to come back to in our opinion , as i have said to mr brok and mr gualtieri , the two rapporteurs for our committee .
this is where europe can make the difference .
this house needs a reality check .
this is always the commission 's proposal . we cannot always get it through in the final procedures when the legislator is finalising the negotiations on the commission 's proposal , but this is possible in parliament and the council .
courage and prudence should always go together .
that can be an added value provided by the european union .
i had the honour of meeting representatives of different political parties , senators and members of parliament .
this is happening as we here in europe are bending over backwards to accommodate the endless sensibilities of muslim believers .
the council 's commitment to reduce , by 2020 , the total community greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % in comparison with 1990 levels , or even by 30 % if other developed countries commit themselves to similar reductions , is an ill - judged move which will have a negative impact on industry and consumers in europe , including in poland .
this is because mrs klamt has had a close family bereavement .
there is no point arguing about that : savings will be made .
it really puts the union on the map .
that work must deepen and grow .
that is most regrettable .
for example , unlike last year , we can state that the court of auditors did not present an entirely clean statement of assurance , but pointed out a number of problems , for example regarding evidence of transactions which could have been better documented and regarding payments from different delegations .
this will allow european airlines to fly to all destinations within the united states .
secondly , they will point the way towards emerging policy objectives where the commission and parliament should work together .
the commission has already carried out a wide - ranging consultation , thereby demonstrating its intentions within the context of its broader strategy for a global europe , intentions that we support .
nor do we have to do anything supernatural - we must simply stipulate that agricultural products imported into the european union should be subject to the same environmental , social , animal welfare and safety standards that european farmers are obliged to observe .
however , when i was there i was impressed by the vibrant and free media and the determination of the people to overcome their difficulties .
thus , this sector is not really affected at all .
however , this proposal also has flaws , and i am certain that the european parliament will address these tomorrow with numerous amendments .
( fi ) mr president , i would like to say a few words about this budget , revenue and expenditure .
the post has been advertised once , six months ago .
as to financing , this is the second thing i would like to say in reply to one important question .
this is what the european parliament , and then the council , believed in 2007 when it recommended that the european commission draft a baltic sea strategy and an action plan .
i hope you will accept this apology in the spirit in which it is made .
' never more ' would mean : let 's go this far again .
the committee on transport and tourism and its rapporteur have , we hope , improved it .
the establishment of a ' blacklist ' surely needs more discussion regarding the means of implementation , for this is another area in which data protection has a key role to play .
on behalf of the alde group . - ( et ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
for awareness of organ donation to flourish circumstances apparently dictate that eu policy , and the commercialisation of health , welfare , and human needs must be opposed .
in the preparation of the commission proposal , as well as during the negotiations , we have been clearly guided by the scientific evidence on the importance of the continuous effort to improve air quality , and specifically on the need to address the fine particles ( pm 2.5 ) .
i would also like to make clear to each of the speakers that i appreciated the high standard of the debate on such an important matter - a matter in which europe must set an example - both by guaranteeing effective collective protection against terrorist threats and also , of course , by remaining very attentive to the protection of individual freedoms and personal autonomy .
this is a task which still faces us , although many countries have now invested billions in this area and have been looking for a reliable solution for 30 years .
compliance with international election standards demonstrates that ukraine is taking the path to a mature democracy and closer cooperation with the eu , based on mutual respect for the fundamental values of the eu .
the discussion about the eur 1 500 increase in the secretarial allowance is symbolic for the issue of whether we are able to slim down our structures , save funds and make our working processes more efficient .
the report on the progress made by croatia in 2007 supports the belief that this country , by implementing the goals facing it , is taking an active approach to the accession process .
mr president , i ask you to hold a minute 's silence in memory of marek rosiak , a man who died while working for the european parliament .
that cannot , in any event , disguise the tragic situation of over a million people caught in the crossfire .
and today we are off to the next wedding , this time in lisbon : splendid atmosphere , wonderful city , no cohn - bendit - everything just as it should be .
mr president , i am also a member of the delegation for relations with the mashreq countries , and , indeed , lebanon is in a tragic situation .
there are precedents , however : for six or seven years i was personally involved in an attempt , along with the organization for security and co - operation in europe ( osce ) and the council of europe , to bring about dialogue involving the government of belarus and the then opposition .
the member states need to find a way through their differences in order to start carrying out our commitment to the region .
the earth is becoming too small and many experts have already discovered the significant potential of the oceans .
the recent protests in several arab countries show that non - democratic and authoritarian regimes cannot ensure credible stability , and that democratic values have a key role in economic and political partnerships .
unfortunately , the sustained development of new technologies , and particularly of the internet , is resulting in the increasingly frequent use by businesses of unethical and dishonest practices in the field of advertising .
the third point is that , in order to find a long - term solution in somalia , the council lends its full support to the djibouti process within the transitional federal government and the alliance for the re - liberation of somalia , and there is no plan b to this process .
the framework of the budget is not very flexible , and it is difficult to reallocate resources .
i think that we should help serbia and we must not forget that this country recently came out of a war .
the few chapters that are left until negotiations can be concluded should be closed before the middle of the year .
the common will to work towards the same direction in terms of the european project is what counts , as was repeatedly said at the december european council .
even in countries such as the netherlands , which have always been known for their international solidarity , voices are heard in favour of cutting development expenditure .
it is another matter again when it comes to works protected by copyright .
this leads me to what the committee on economic affairs has rightly brought into the report : completing the internal market is in itself great consumer policy .
together with the european arrest warrant , this means that anyone is liable to be arrested and sentenced in any eu member state in which they have been tried and sentenced by default , without ever being told or realising that proceedings have been brought against them .
fourth : the legality of the agreement .
i trust that parliament will give its full support to the report and that the commission and council will take matters forward in the manner it recommends .
in addition , vague , controversial concepts like ' self - governance ' and ' cultural autonomy ' also have the potential to cause conflict .
as a member of the committee on foreign affairs and rapporteur on the black sea cooperation , i would like to focus on an important aspect to be promoted in the eu foreign policy .
apart from that some other provisions also need to be harmonised with the european standards .
in my opinion there are three areas that are most important as regards bringing stability to ukraine and also benefit to the european union .
we are very good at research ; we are very good at science ; but where we have difficulty is in converting these wonderful ideas that have revolutionised the world into tangible products .
i would like to stress that the new dci should provide a basis for targeted and more flexible aid in situations of fragility .
the energy charter treaty is especially important because it is the basis of european cooperation on energy matters , and russia too must ratify it .
in writing . - i wanted to vote for this report on un priorities for the 64th session of the un general assembly because many of the priorities are worthy and should be supported and even promoted .
member of the commission . - mr president , i would like to congratulate mrs carvalho for this very comprehensive report .
it is in this context that i support measures that will incentivise environmental best practices in the problematic region of campania , in italy .
we should also look at good practice in other eu countries , for we could devise a much better long - term policy to tackle alcohol - related harm .
a truly effective additional sanction could also be introduced for countries failing to adhere to the stability pact .
we need to define a strong common position and ensure the european union 's active participation in future international negotiations .
( fr ) mr president , last week the package of legislation on climate change and energy was presented .
i would not like to see this compromise package being unwrapped again .
a vote for discharge does not mean that the situation is totally ideal .
i would like to thank him very much for this personal kindness , as pessoa is one of our great poets and i would like to quote pessoa again : he once spoke about ' a nostalgia for the future ' .
a committee meeting may be held , even on thursday , but without taking a vote .
they are asking questions like : ' how are we going to get the markets under control in the near future ? ' .
we do not want everyone trying to go their own way .
dick marty has worked with very great commitment here , and i would like to express my thanks to him .
otherwise i welcome the agreement of the council on the energy package .
the effort of many people combined to produce this success .
unfortunately , there are only a few of us here .
my second point is the climate agenda , where , of course , the commission 's efforts have also been extremely important in my view and that of many of my colleagues in the ppe , the climate change area is where the european union has been most successful .
my government is certainly working with the aim of reducing social exclusion , creating the basis for self - determination through work , and ensuring that more people are in work .
it was a very inclusive process .
as long as people comply with the rules of the posting of workers directive they have the right to work anywhere in the eu .
i think it is important that the public can monitor the situation , because it is very clear that it is public money that is given to ngos and the process should be completely transparent .
it is important to remember that community funding for research is awarded to beneficiaries on the sole criterion of the scientific excellence of their proposals .
as regards the point made by mrs miguélez ramos , who wanted a further extension to the two specific instances in the atlantic and in the adriatic , these are specific , small and inconsequential cases .
the european court of human rights in the eu will perhaps impose minarets and burkas on europe , and some proceedings are already under way ; is , conversely , the crucifix to disappear from school walls and perhaps subsequently from first - aid boxes , seals , coats of arms and national flags ?
we were faced with two undesirable alternatives , either a shorter agreement with higher fish quotas or a longer agreement with lower fish quotas .
the consideration of production costs in the definition of guide prices ;
crucially , we must pay greater attention to the maintenance , balance and enhancement of the services rendered by the forest .
pumping enormous sums into this model carries the serious risk of deepening the environmental and social crises .
the socialist group in the european parliament will always see to it that all citizens can feel safe , whether on the street , at major events or in their home .
we also saw an increase in the trend for falsifying even life - saving medicines , including medicines to treat cancer and heart disease , psychiatric disorders and infections .
( es ) madam president , i understand the difficulty of the undertaking , and i acknowledge and commend the work done by the rapporteurs .
now that both member states have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the schengen review , there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further .
discussing common data standards is one thing - but making it a mandatory objective for the justice and home affairs council is another .
we are at last adopting the necessary update to the third liberalisation package .
this is part of our decent work agenda .
the calls which the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe are making are clear .
we know what ships can be built , and what else besides vessels can be produced .
therefore , the good of the citizens , their freedom and liberty , but also the highest possible standards of security which should be guaranteed to them , are one of the main elements of the work which the eu institutions should undertake .
in writing . - ( nl ) i have voted against the compromise in the sacconi report on co 2 emissions from cars .
it is necessary to check whether union funds are being well used , whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them , and whether any resources are being wasted .
degradation of the soil is often the result of inappropriate human activity in the areas of agriculture and forestry .
the negotiation of these texts has been passionate and has allowed real advances in the protection of human health and the environment .
this coordination has worked exceptionally well .
we must rise to this challenge together because , if we do not do so together , europe is in danger of being marginalised .
madam president , i said ' could ' because in the final days of the apec summit , the united states and china seemed to have decided to change the scope of the copenhagen meeting .
they are dealing with difficulties in providing the co - financing required for their participation in the research framework programme .
another area in which the alliance is eager to collaborate is the union for the mediterranean in order to help improve and manage intercultural diversity and intercultural dialogue , including inter - faith issues , within and among european and muslim societies and communities .
clearly , i shall pass over the question of the responsibility for all this .
and what thanks did they get ?
however , we do have serious misgivings on the issue of the reversal of the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the accused .
it used to be that countries could fix a higher price .
the picture needs to be big when it comes to innovation , too , but sometimes the answer is to be found in the small things .
the climate change and energy package , for example , has had so many derogations that it is practically devoid of substance , due to the crisis .
we know how important independent journalism is in every society .
what impact will the fight against poverty have on your 2020 strategy objective , when we learn that , today , within the european union , 116 million people were threatened by poverty or social exclusion on the basis of figures valid for 2008 ?
we then apply to join at the worst possible moment .
srebrenica and its terrible tragedy are not only the most recent instance of human horror .
therefore , if we reduce obligations , we reduce costs , and by reducing costs , we make it easier for them to operate .
instead , it is time for turkey to send positive signals to the eu .
i believe that we can best measure the progress we have made by what we set as the goal at the beginning of the debate .
we should also recognise that ongoing reforms carry new risks as they make future pensions far more dependent on long - term developments in the labour market and financial markets .
the situation may be improving , but only very slowly .
indeed , 99 % of all businesses in europe are smes , providing more than 100 million jobs .
that is the very least that the citizens of europe can expect .
a clause has been included in the agreement about the compulsory publication of correlation tables , which i called for in my report on internal market scoreboards , and binding time limits for implementation of directives , which should not exceed two years .
both of these countries are our partners under the european neighbourhood policy , and have been severely hit by the global economic and financial crisis of the last two years .
now , in the council , where is our ' put a man on the moon ' project in europe ?
finally , i would like to thank the european commission for its promptness in approving the funding for the four energy projects which romania is also involved in .
this will enable parliament to state clearly and unambiguously that discrimination can no longer be tolerated and that parliament considers the rights of all its citizens equally important .
i expect it to evolve into a more transparent institution and to work even more closely with parliament and the commission .
this , too , is something that the commission cannot do by itself .
however , the commission is keen to make sure that this initiative , if it were to be approved by the european council , does not undermine our efforts to build on the success of the lisbon treaty and , most of all , does not undermine its certification .
yet , at the same time , economic and trade relations between the european union and russia are strong , and getting stronger .
we supported you when others did not and we supported you because of your longstanding reputation as a reformer .
if there is one area in which europe excels , it is in the creation of agencies , bodies and all kinds of structures , provided with staff and a budget , which justify the union 's action and give the appearance of wanting to resolve the problems .
so the eu could decide if foreign warships are permitted to visit - those of our friends and allies perhaps ?
15 .
for the european union and our member states , respect for human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law are fundamental principles that bind us together .
in this sense i welcome mr mitchell 's proposal that the commission report annually to parliament and the council on the assessment of the impact of the financing operations .
this would , of course , not have prevented the volcanic eruption , but it would perhaps have allowed us to act more effectively and more quickly .
i hope that this year 's assessment report will encourage turkey to improve the coordination of its foreign policy with that of the eu .
pactio olisipiensis censenda est !
one of the things that i have said to all the foreign ministers and i say to parliament is : please resist the temptation to assume that , because the first four or five appointments i make are not from a member state that you might know best , it does not mean that i will not make appointments in the future from those member states .
anyone who wants pluralism and political competition should ensure that the election standards declared by the council of europe are adhered to and should allow long - term election observation by the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) at the earliest stage .
taiwan , today , shows high economic growth and low unemployment .
there is then also the question of an interest - rate rebate on loans .
so this cooperation on which the ideas of the future strategy have been built - as i said at the beginning , it was the stakeholders who came in on the public consultation on this - has to be brought to a fruitful dialogue and what you call for - a regular dialogue .
you said that only six member states are accounting for how they recover funds .
nor can you find out what happens to your data .
i hope that we can count on the commission to submit to parliament an annual report analysing - and ' analysing ' is the key word - the implementation of the agreement .
madam president , it is true that progress has been made but it has to be said that progress is painfully slow .
a total of eur 35.6 million has been released from the eu solidarity fund to repair this damage .
we fully support iraq remaining a unified and sovereign state .
they will be saved by taxpayers .
although far from a binding agreement , but clearly along the lines of a political agreement , the outcome of copenhagen should lead us to question why it was such a disappointment .
at the end of this month , the eu will discuss the issue of climate change as a matter of priority at the eu - china and eu - india summit conferences .
we have therefore voted against this report in its entirety .
for what purposes ?
now that fishing is permitted again , it is carried out on the basis of the precautionary principle , and that is the way it should be done .
it is important that the soil proposal both protects peatlands as valuable habitats under threat , while at the same time allows for the appropriate extraction of peat as a raw material .
only countries can be admitted to the programme , not international organisations or communities .
i support this report because it suggests ways in which we can improve the situation of the roma community .
this prompts the question as to who is in a position to provide this reasonable assurance .
modern management of biological diversity calls for increased monitoring of the processes being developed and suitable investment in scientific research .
the permitted number of pupils in classes in european schools is 32 .
the young are leaving , so who will remain to work the land ?
rapporteur . - ( hu ) mr president , commissioner fischer boel , ladies and gentlemen , in a world of climate change , increasing energy demand and rising prices , it is an absolute priority and a matter of vital interest to the european union to reduce energy dependence and energy consumption and to diversify energy sources .
the choice is simple : either we annihilate terrorism , or terrorism will visit apocalypse on the world .
this support is essential for helping the unemployed and victims of relocation due to globalisation .
the principles of the convention are respect for dignity , autonomy , freedom of choice , independence , non - discrimination , social inclusion , respect for difference , equal opportunities , accessibility and equality between men and women .
ladies and gentlemen , we want to continue to make the institutions operate more efficiently .
certainly when you remember that with restructuring , that fleet disappears , and so there is a complete reduction in co 2 emissions .
furthermore , there are experts who are worried about maintaining requirements which do not completely eliminate the use of substances that are carcinogenic , mutagenic or toxic for reproduction ( known as ' cmr substances ' ) , although new restrictions are imposed .
the project has been put back five years , with the operating phase planned to begin in 2013 .
( pl ) mr president , during the communist period , people in poland used to say there were three ontological categories : being , non - being and planning .
but we could never get back what we lost in the crisis .
i count on parliament to help .
( ro ) mr president , according to european statistics , well over half of workers in the european union , particularly immigrants , do not enjoy social protection .
the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) calls on all member states to participate fully in this debate .
it reduces the severity of the consequences of colliding with a vehicle .
ladies and gentlemen , i would also like to state that the debate in lille , in addition to the action plan , presented the individual member states with a set of concrete actions in this area , some of which , i must say , were very radical and in my view capable of producing results .
it also means that massive pressure must be put on the us to bring that country to support this goal .
it is well balanced and gives an objective description of developments in macedonia ; commending what has been achieved and appealing for a little more time to be devoted to what remains to be done .
( hu ) we have noticed recently that public opinion is following this question with exceptional interest , and particularly those aspects that we , too , are debating , that is to say , the questions of opt - out and of on - call time .
this strength was also proven 10 years ago when europe armed itself with a currency , the euro , which is undergoing its first major test but is holding its own .
( fr ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the european food aid programme for the most deprived persons in the eu was urgently introduced during the exceptionally cold winter of 1986 , then enshrined the following year in the common agricultural policy .
if i had known , i would of course have given you the floor .
i would be very grateful if you could investigate this issue , because we are all aware that the chinese are continuing to play an active role and are imposing export restrictions and duties , which present our companies with huge problems .
worse still , you are now so fearful of public opinion - you know that you are losing the argument - that you have sunk to abuse .
this naturally leads to rising prices and human suffering , which , incidentally , also affects livestock farmers in europe .
the uk timeshare industry is worth approximately eur 157 million per year , and this directive constitutes an important move forward in eliminating unscrupulous agents who cause problems for consumers and bring legitimate operators into disrepute .
( pl ) madam president , commissioner , the european parliament has involved itself on numerous occasions in the issue of building democracy in georgia .
i am going to turn my attention away from the text again for just a moment .
for , although the proposal has been halted for the moment , the ideas must not be buried .
secondly , how do the agencies perform against the criteria ?
it would benefit both them and us because the eu is incomplete without the balkans , and since the serbs have recently been joking that their only friends are god and the greeks , in my opinion , we should show them that they also have friends in the european parliament .
i agree that certain flanking measures should be adapted or adopted , and i am convinced that quite a lot can be done in the new article 68 .
let me mention here some of our most important ongoing initiatives , such as the solvency ii proposal , the proposals for revisions to the capital requirements directive , which was adopted by the college of commissioners last week , and the legislative proposal on credit - rating agencies , due shortly .
all those who campaign for human rights in iran , for example in the one - million - signature campaign for women 's rights , deserve our support and admiration .

this principle ought to extend to all the activities carried out by the publications office .

this year , the united kingdom alone will receive a rebate of some eur 3 billion because of a discount on contributions negotiated in 1984 .
the new asean charter shows specifically that violations of human rights cannot be ignored , mr tannock , and the negotiations leading up to it prove that violations of human rights are very much on the agenda .
i said at camp david that just as open societies need the rule of law , legal rules , in the same way , the markets also need rules in order to be legitimate , credible and ethical .
could they bring me the clause that provides for this sort of protean development ?
the data protection directive lays down some very strict rules and i think that it has emerged from the debate , which has been very wide - ranging and very complicated , that the situation is developing very rapidly .
let us hope that it will come up with a good agreement , as that would represent a joint success .
among other matters , it will touch upon regional issues , global security , transatlantic economic partnership , and global challenges , including climate change and energy .
i would therefore ask for a written explanation on the website so that every citizen can also understand it .
i am sure that all of them will , during the course of the next five years , look back with gratitude and respect at the legacy which you , mr president , have left this institution .
the european union 's relations with russia must be based on partnership and not confrontation .
i hope that , after the vote , parliament and the council can sit down together to find an early agreement on this issue .
mr president , i rise on the issue of palestine .
to conclude , i would once again like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs , the commission for their excellent contribution , and also the services of the itre committee for the help that they have given me in drawing up this report .
the commission should investigate alternative energy solutions for the future , at the same time taking into consideration the different energy needs of the eu member states .
basically , i have just one comment to make , commissioner , and that is that your background is in regional politics , in a large state in germany , whereas mine is in local politics .
the latter is of course based on the value of the fundamental entity , namely the human being . european policy should be consistent in every respect as regards handing down and enforcing sentences and the general links between convicted persons and society .
while we live in our golden world , which is actually made up of infinite compromises , there are so many people who are being exploited , who are dying in cruel and inhuman ways , as happened yesterday in italy .
member of the commission . - mr president , i would first like to thank diego for an excellent summary of today 's debate .
mr langen , i asked you last time to bring me proof that you are capable of this sort of basic calculation .
unfortunately , global governance in the field of environmental protection is decentralized and sometimes the coherence of overall decisions is lacking ; 18 multilateral institutions are responsible with monitoring approximately 500 international agreements , of which 300 at regional level .
we have given the special court eur 2 700 000 through the european instrument for democracy and human rights .
we believe that there are several reasons for their inclusion .
in fact , for the time being , we are not going to pay ( applause ) the corresponding financial contribution .
we need regulations .
do you think a very difficult agreement in copenhagen without these flexible mechanisms could be impossible ?
( ga ) mr president , i welcome the response of the president - in - office of the council .
there might be some delays . we deplore that , of course , but i know that all countries are working as quickly and swiftly as possible .
therefore , the system 's sustainability is an urgent problem .
a sound industrial policy is needed , but not economic nationalism .
thank you all .
let us hope , then , that everybody will shoulder their responsibilities .
the main political parties are in complete agreement on this issue . the greater part of society also concurs with this view .
clearly , therefore , we must also adopt a position on this issue at european level .
we cannot be satisfied simply by providing aid selectively , otherwise we will not be solving the problems , we will merely be forever postponing them .
3 .
we should make the strategic partnership closer , deeper and broader .
what is important is that we can start our work .
we have to ensure that member states fulfil their promises , because we have an eu framework .
mr trichet , you and i earn high enough salaries not to be too much affected by energy and food prices .
one of the consequences derived from the crisis was the need to create independent european agencies for supervising the banks and insurance of the financial markets .
a month ago , we debated the murder of journalists .
their modest participation is negatively perceived , and has a negative impact on the sustainable development of the union , as well as on its cohesion .
the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) was involved , and we also consulted the food and agriculture organization , the united nations environment programme , the climate conference of the federal republic of germany , and many others , with the result that we now have the facts before us .
i would also like to thank them for recognising that the special procedures foreseen in the agreement will apply in all extremely urgent cases .
these negotiations concluded with the initialling of a new protocol on the 3 june 2010 , which was then amended by exchange of letters on 29 october 2010 .
the package that we are voting on today includes provisions that go absolutely in the direction one would wish for the development of the telecommunications market , in an orderly fashion and for the benefit of everybody : a european regulation entrusted to a body of european regulators for electronic communications ( berec ) with mixed financing , without a veto ; a balance between competition and the need for new investment - functional separation is limited to exceptional cases ; a desire to focus attention on public services in spectrum management ; new services ; new freedom of access ; and , thanks to mr harbour in particular , a considerable increase in the rights of consumers .
action plan on urban mobility (

risks for pensions are not the same as insurance companies or banks .
( el ) thank you for your reply , commissioner .
we do want to see an improvement in the environment , as i have indicated , to allow the deployment of the election observation mission with the participation of meps .
i suppose the investigation will give us concrete answers as to what the causes of the accident were and , in many cases , this is a tragic combination of several factors , including human factors .
nonetheless , i do not believe that we should be engaging in self - righteous meddling in the internal policy affairs of other states , all the more so given that the eu is by no means in a position to assume the role of a model of democracy .
but i believe that it wants to engage with us and we have re - established a recent history of engagement with pakistan , which i understand is progressing reasonably successfully .
the commission has played its part , and many member states have sent aid or teams of experts .
i do not think that this is something we ought to be proud of .
this march , as mr pöttering has just said , marks the thirtieth anniversary of his death , in 1979 .
and just be aware that for gdynia and szczecin there is an opportunity .
a 2010 un joint study has revealed that eu member states colluded with and participated in activities relating to the cia rendition programme and secret prisons .

( fr ) we are europe .
given the nutritional importance of school milk , however , the aid for products falling within that regulation should be increased substantially , from eur 16.11 per 100 kg to eur 18.15 per 100 kg .
that is my request and there is also a corresponding passage in our motion for a resolution on this subject , so that we can contribute to ensuring that procedures that have proved successful in the member states can also be guaranteed after the final introduction of the single euro payments area .
the regulation to be adopted makes it possible to harmonise regional investment and helps joint planning , thus strengthening the energy market and supply security .
the protection of intellectual property rights and geographical indications at global level remains fairly inadequate ; it neutralises the competitive advantage of the high added value of european industrial and agricultural products .
on the one hand , due account is taken of the fact that the crisis has disrupted the entire economic and production landscape and hence also the tractor industry : this flexibility measure will enable it to recover immediately and will also have a positive impact on agriculture as a whole .
the proposal that eur 40 million will be spent establishing and staffing an entire office in malta to deal with asylum seekers across the eu suggests that this commission wants to make the decisions that should be left to national governments .
there are other aspects , but trade is a very important one , and there is a feasibility study on trade already on the way .
because if we operate and play games of chance via the internet then the profits are created elsewhere and not in the countries the players come from .
these included : the need to duly consider the accessibility handicap affecting regions with specific natural or geographical characteristics , such as the outermost regions ; the need for the renewed eu tourism policy to make european tourism sustainable in economic , social , territorial , environmental and cultural terms ; the promotion of europe as a tourist destination or a collection of attractive tourist destinations ; the need to coordinate the policies with a direct or indirect impact on tourism ; closer cooperation among the stakeholders in the sector - the european commission and the member states , the regions , local authorities and tourism services - and better use of existing european financial instruments .
i await the reactions to this before my second turn .
i think this is certainly a far - reaching proposal ; it is an ambitious proposal and requires important decisions to be made in the member states , and we would ask them to rise to the challenge it entails .
( sk ) the legal environment in the member states in the area of debt recovery varies .
no mention was made of the willing and free exchange between buyer and seller in order to produce the profit which can then be reinvested to create jobs .
i would like to take this opportunity to thank the european parliament and the european commission for their creative cooperation .
i believe the commission has made the right choice of areas in which partnerships should be established with the countries which are in these associations with us .
as for the ' fair value ' principle , it favours a short - term approach and makes financial results the dominant factor in company management .
any legal proposal will also aim for a smooth transition for those areas which may lose their status of areas with a natural handicap .
thank you ; it is a good sign .
my group therefore expects the european council to go beyond words and to give serious consideration to our common economic objectives on the basis of the commission 's 2020 proposals , an amended version of which parliament will propose in june .
if so , i should like to know that too , because then i would think that you consider it unimportant .
this should be the overriding message of next month 's european council : an active european union , looking to the future , working hard for the benefit of citizens and deserving of the confidence of those citizens .
you told us that the flag and the anthem would be dropped , but i have not seen much evidence of that .
i cannot be in favour of the proposed budgets for this type of service with its militaristic tendencies .
i would like to know how the european commission intends to approach these negotiations and this draft convention , and on the basis of what mandate it will act on behalf of all of us , so that tomorrow , in the area of domestic work , the european union can set an example and that we , too , can give expression to the values of the european union .
now i was going to say whether any more needed to be said to prove the huge conflict of interest that there would be if countries effectively rated their own debt .
mr president , prime minister orbán , mr barroso , ladies and gentlemen , rarely will the presidency of the council of ministers have had to face so many challenges : the challenge of the euro , which we must stabilise , the challenge of employment , which is experiencing stronger growth and therefore a more efficient economy , the challenge of energy independence and food security , while prices for raw materials are rising alarmingly .
given that fact , it is important to enable european citizens to understand , analyse and assess the flood of information and images they receive , so that they can make the best possible use of them .
the internet has specifically given rise to new problems , such as that of data protection on social networking sites or in connection with projects such as google street view .
so i have a full understanding of the issue that you are considering with care and that you are approaching with such critical insight .
in the case of croatia , this involved for the first time the attainment of a set of benchmarks .

i wish to tell him that we are only at the consultation stage with this dossier , and i should like to assure him on behalf of the whole parliament that our amendments will help to bring greater order into the agency system .
if every sme in europe could create one job tomorrow , this would have an enormously positive effect on employment levels .

mr president , baroness ashton , ladies and gentlemen , foreign policy has been dominated by the revolutions - some more peaceful than others - taking place in a number of neighbouring mediterranean countries and , more recently , by a symbolic event in the fight against international terrorism , namely , the end of the bin laden era .
what i think most british people understood by the common market was that there would be mutual product recognition , that if you could sell something in the uk , you should also be allowed to sell it in germany , france and spain and the other way round .
the proposal aimed at increasing the transparency of recruitment procedures , competitions for managerial positions and the award of grants for scientific research does seem appropriate , though .

it is likely that one of these will be genuine and the others superfluous .
if we want meps to work effectively they must have the option of carrying out their duties in their own language if they so decide .
there is no majority in the council to remove the opt - out and there is a risk that the report adopted today , which is already a compromise , will not be the last on the issue .
this is just one of a multitude of eu laws that have damaged , and will continue to damage , my country .
but nobody wants to lose out in the process .
therefore that also colours our interpretation of such findings , making it all the more important that there should be a really open investigation allowing full transparency and full access for the international community .
investment to increase energy efficiency will create millions of jobs and will contribute to the growth of the eu economy .
the death penalty and the release of prisoners held since the tiananmen square massacre : these are among the reasons why this parliament is in favour of maintaining the embargo on arms to china .

at present things are not too satisfactory .

the greek communist party calls on the working and grassroots classes to condemn this reactionary resolution in practical ways , by stepping up their fight against the anti - grassroots attack by capital in the european union and the bourgeois governments , thereby supporting efforts to build a socio - political alliance of the working classes and self - employed which will claim changes for the benefit of the people .

it is particularly worthy of mention in terms of the understanding of our fellow citizens that the present legal act takes account not only of the specific recommendations of the united nations but also of member states ' subsidiarity requirements .
we expect that , to achieve this , the commission will use the right of initiative to its full potential .
we expect that schengen area accession will become a reality and that we will not have to wait until september .
the decline in the number of colonies is therefore regrettable , and we need scientific data to enable us to understand the mechanisms that help the spread of this species and develop ways of ensuring its preservation .

we have the european parliament , we have the commission , we have the european council and , in the end , the institutions are responsible - not wise men or , as we would prefer maybe to say , ' the bright kids ' - and what they could bring as a stimulus to our debate .
if this were to happen , my group and i would be entirely satisfied with the decision .
we must remember that the cost of the necessary initial investment is one of the main problems faced by regional small and medium - sized enterprises when investing in renewable - energy projects , which is mentioned in this regulation .

madam president , i strongly supported paragraph 25 of this resolution which ' regrets that with the limited increase foreseen for the progress programme . . . ' , because the commission committed back in 2010 to reinstate the eur 20 million that was going from progress to microfinance and that obviously is not going to happen .

mr president , i completely agree that we must push to find a legally binding agreement in copenhagen .

( es ) actually , yesterday i submitted my explanation of vote in writing and i received a response to the effect that it was still being dealt with , and so on .
we would also like to take up the matter of climate financing .
this would be much more difficult in the future because you would need a qualified majority of the member states representatives to block it .
we have to learn how to do that .
can the original contracts be amended ?
the eu and , more importantly , the political actors failed dramatically in the financial crisis .

the economic crisis is the worst justification for not taking ambitious measures to protect the climate .
the exact cause of the accident in the gulf of mexico is still unknown .
one of them has been mentioned , namely the problem of red tape , bureaucracy and over - complicated rules .
so we have these two ways of pressing other countries to come forward with ambitious commitments and agree in a legally binding agreement .
if all the members of this house raise their voices , however , and are joined by those in other countries , then the citizens of countries enduring repression will realise it is worth telling the truth and standing up to such regimes .
this can vary by 9 years for women and by as much as 13 years for men .
not in 2011 , not in 2012 , but in 2013 , when we have the possibility to do so .

some states show demonstrable laxity when it comes to respecting fundamental rights in a prison environment .
however , at the moment , turkey is not meeting them and , in that regard , there are two essential factors , democracy and human rights , which are central to the analysis of turkey 's possible future membership of the european union .
but our target , as i said in this parliament several times before , is growth : sustainable inclusive growth .
the submitted text takes account of this danger and leaves sufficient flexibility for handling crisis situations in the hands of the operators .
the commission must come forward with these plans now .
regarding the single market , i welcome all the remarks and the focus on the single market , because this is really the eu 's main crown jewel .
prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances (

europe 2020 must not trigger another competition marathon and privatisation exodus .
well , yes it does , because we will now have in place a similar set of rights for buses and coaches to those that we currently have for other modes of transport .
i say this because i find it rather difficult to understand why a report that addresses the issue of poverty makes no reference to rising food prices .
we cannot create loopholes , though emissions trading in the eu is a model example of how to do that !

the commission has now proposed that the stability and growth pact be tightened up .
president - in - office of the council . - ( fr ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , as several of you pointed out , no compromise is perfect .

this becomes clear when one looks at the past year and a half of its activities .
all the european institutions that depend on the european union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the court of auditors and by all entities with that function .
thich quang do , the leader of the church , is still being held under arrest , and the land belonging to the catholics is still confiscated .

i have a pro - european programme , linked to the treaty of lisbon .
many working class women endure significant exploitation , through wage levels that are much lower than men 's , for example , and precarious work .
draft amending budget no 6/2009 (
i also agree that we should extend this stress test in neighbouring countries , the countries east of our borders . this is why i ask the commission to consider the possibility of how to execute a stress test in the context of the eastern partnership .
but i share the rapporteur 's view that the strategy calls for continuous follow - up if it is really to develop to the consumers ' advantage .

a study carried out by the german institute for employment research indicates that the blue card would result in an economy in which ' above all vacant positions are filled more quickly and the wages paid to resident skilled workers are kept at a lower level ' .

on rules of origin , the negotiations with south korea resulted in a number of changes which are consistent with the ongoing process of reform of such rules .

with the open skies agreement between the us and europe , we now finally have the opportunity to establish airline routes from the european union via the united states to third countries such as mexico and south america .

like you , mr giegold , in paragraph 28 , we regret the lack of binding commitments among governments to enforce coordination in the euro area .
for those cases the commission will not hesitate to launch infringement proceedings .
during periods of weak demand on the world economy , the price war between airbus and boeing has been , and remains , intense .
the regulations on the system of environmental taxes could therefore reduce the competitiveness of these economies and , as a result , reduce environmental awareness .

in my opinion , it is irresponsible for airlines to ask their pilots to fly at their own risk .
the role of the union is to take the lead , to undertake initiatives , to suggest to nato means of closer cooperation , to pass from words to deeds , and i take the example of the recent letter by the polish , german and french foreign ministers , to which lady ashton did react , as a good starting point in the right direction .
indeed , making significant efforts to ' decarbonise ' the economy must not affect the competitiveness of energy - intensive industries .

after nearly a century of subjugation by serbia , they certainly do not want any new interference from outside .
let me conclude . commissioner , i do think that the past five years have indeed been a success .

the european union should stay true to its values and defend them , and not let itself be blinded in a region which is the source of most of russia 's energy resources .
it is for this reason that we believe that europe and the european union have to take a leading role in combating all these challenges .
but , if we are going to talk about energy efficiency , let us make sure that we actually have some joined - up thinking on this .

europe must take its fair share of this responsibility .
i believe the member states should be financially supported and , at the same time , forced to invest more in building safe parking areas , improving and developing the transport infrastructure .
in order to do this , a joint european crisis map must be drawn up , through which it would be easier to assess the areas afflicted by abject poverty .
although our government has not breached a single provision of the treaties , it has become an object of criticism , moralising and lecturing .
but the challenges of climate change also call for a new political approach .
my only reservation is with regard to amendment 39 , part of which argues that freedom of speech should not be compromised , even in cases of harassment .
however , the basic conditions for competition within the european union between the north and the south must remain at the same level .
although it could do with some improvement and streamlining , the regulation which affects this report provides a sound legal basis .
the text makes provision for an increase in the retirement age of european workers and for retirement ages to be linked to life expectancy .
this is why i would like to join with my fellow members who support this report and propose measures aimed at increasing ' intelligent ' investments , which is a solution not only for the climate crisis , but also for the credit crunch because it has the potential to generate new jobs .
president of the commission . - the issue of corruption was dealt with when we had this outreach meeting with african leaders , but i can tell you that anti - corruption issues are going to be high on the agenda of the g 20 meeting in november .
the returns directive is an initial step towards a proper policy to combat the phenomenon .
coordination and cooperation at international level will be incredibly important if we are to ensure a broad recovery and to set the tone for a return to long - term , sustainable growth based on a firm foundation .
those who do not register shall be refused a long - term access pass to the european parliament .
i thank mrs jeggle for what was , on the whole , a very good report .
fourth , the sensible request from the floor that the vote be repeated under normal circumstances has been rejected .
thank you for your attention .
secondly , when there is a conflict , either it relates to defending our economic interests - for example , as in airbus - or it poses a risk to our health or environmental rules - in the case of beef containing hormones , for instance , or chlorinated chicken - and we should therefore not prioritise the improvement of economic relations over our own internal model , our social model , our environmental model , or development model , as if economic relations were an end in themselves .
web - tv is to be launched after the summer and , on behalf of the socialist group in the european parliament , i hope that the editorial team enjoys a position of independence , with full freedom to show the debates held here .
the third puts forward a requirement for that citizen to provide proof of his or her nationality , either by means of passport , identity card or other document , for the diplomatic or consular representation to be provided .
how can this be achieved , however , if the problems and their potential solutions are not fully understood ?
furthermore , for the first time , this gives immigrants a legal means by which to enter european union territory , in order to be able to work amongst us .
the next item is the report by konrad szymański , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , on the review of the european neighbourhood and partnership instrument .
in parliament , access to meetings and documents is almost total .
the quality of the work they produce is first - class , because it comes from the european parliament .
( the minutes of the previous sitting were approved )
often , it is children who are in the greatest danger .
the sharp conflict and mistrust that has prevailed in moldovan society over recent weeks can only be overcome through a transparent process .
i am deeply ashamed that the british government is refusing to accept this aid , refusing to apply for this co - financed aid .
it is not a road safety issue .
today , a renewed peace process has begun .
another aspect that is very prominent in our 21st century is the ever - larger role played by the new technologies , both in culture and in international relations .
it provides jobs for 12 million eu citizens and 92 % of it is made up of small and medium - sized enterprises - the backbone of our economy .
whatever happened to the blue card regulation ?
what do you expect ?
the swift agreement is a very powerful weapon in the fight against terrorism , as it gives access to privileged financial information regarding financial transfers between countries .
let me just cite two key examples , namely the substantial improvements and slimmed - down provisions regarding overdraft facilities and the emerging arrangement on article 16 in respect of compensation for early repayment .
around two weeks ago , a meeting took place between dr mohamed elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) , and the commission .
if i may interpret what the president of the commission said : it was mr langen , not mr ferber , who spoke .
strengthening market surveillance must be a key feature of the revision of the general product safety directive , ensuring the traceability of products and manufacturers and laying down and applying standardisation principles , which would facilitate better protection of our consumers and would provide them with clearer and more accurate information about products they have bought .
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - ( pl ) mr president , the special court for sierra leone is entitled to count on our particular attention , as it is rightly presented as a new and almost perfect model for the pursuit of justice .
the commission will pay close attention to ensure that the implementing measures brought forward in this regard are prudentially sound .
in short , it is hard to find a sector in which energy efficiency cannot be improved with the aid of ict developments .
we should approach such matters in a more balanced and dispassionate way .
- ( es ) mr president , i would also like to join in the cries of ' good news ! ' voiced by mr yañez - barnuevo garcía because i believe that this report marks a turning - point in relations with the united states .
because many times , instead of the animals for slaughter travelling long distances , they should be killed in the member state and travel as chilled meat .
workers have the right to be protected by european legislation , and we are now talking about the health of restaurant and hotel workers .
this is a priority for the commission , as stated in the communication on innovation union adopted on 6 october last , in the small business act for europe adopted in june 2008 and in the review of the small business act adopted on 23 february this year .
( pl ) may i , on behalf of all members of the european parliament , and also our parliamentary services and assistants , offer you , madam president , our sincere thanks - to you personally , to the bureau of the european parliament and to the entire administration - for chairing the debates so well , for good cooperation and for mutual understanding .
draft general budget 2009 ( section iii ) (
in writing . - ( pt ) i abstained from voting on my report because , although i recognise the urgency of concluding the agreement and consider this proposal to be positive in part as regards the distribution of fishing licences , and given that it is not feasible to amend it , which is the responsibility of the council and the commission , i strongly disagree with the failure to observe the principle of relative stability that has always prevailed in previous agreements .
in the end , the group 's coordinators reached the consensus that mr kovács had probably struck the right balance .
it is imperative to encourage the equal sharing among men and women of responsibilities in personal and family life and better distribute the time allotted to paid and unpaid work .
now we ought to consolidate those proposals .
we should be careful not to take a one - sided position .
the request will be explained further by mr preda .
i therefore call on the commission and the council to submit legislative proposals to correct this unjust situation .
we remember the victims .
the failure of the doha round will probably never be more costly than it is right now .
education and the media play a key role in this regard .
apart from being the largest financial donor to lebanon , the european union has been making efforts through intensive diplomatic activities also to find a solution for the country 's political paralysis .
it was recommended at the world forum that the parliaments of as many countries as possible should establish the institution of a commissioner responsible for future generations .
can the european commission make a comprehensive statement as to the present state of play with regard to the wto process ?
thank you , mr president . i shall vote in favour .
i would like to thank the council for its response .
i am convinced of the need to grasp the potential of the arctic region in the global context .
it also falls short of the recommendations made by the relevant parliamentary committees on several counts .
and that gives wide scope to target behaviour and speech that has , as its purpose , the instigation of a terrorist offence .
as a hungarian who was once forced to be a citizen of the russian empire , it is especially difficult for me to draw this conclusion .
in western terms , they are undoubtedly undemocratic systems .
so the schools are built by belgium , germany , france etc.
we talk about the disposed eggs and the disposed meat and what ...
i have brought along a book , which is the treaty establishing a constitution for europe .
this is the only way to ensure that the ownership of a strategy is in the hands of the member states and other stakeholders .
from this perspective , i believe that the european union and the european parliament should act transparently and clearly , and as long as some members feel that their votes have been treated by the voting equipment differently to the way they voted , and they did not have the possibility to check it on their monitors , then the vote will continue to be controversial .
some states have failed to respect the transposition deadline and are having problems due to the gaps in the text .
now that this treaty is being ratified , there is something to fight for .
in 2011 the priority has been on young people , and this will no longer be the case in 2012 with these guidelines .
there are one or two of our fellow members of the house who have to accept that mr barroso , the commission president , had something else in his diary for today . i am pleased that you are here , madam vice - president , because you are responsible for driving forward communication in the european union and this might present an opportunity for today 's topic - namely the commission 's work programme - to be fully debated in the national parliaments as well , so that we have this type of interplay from the outset .
we therefore call for an end to the war and to violence by all parties , and we urge the eu to act accordingly .
we know the goal that we need to get to , and we have to recognise that sustainability is a process that needs to have clear goals , but not all countries can move at the same pace .
sexual orientation and gender identity at the un human rights council (
china is in first place and now imports more protein than the european union . we therefore have a competitor in this area .
women and young people especially often get stuck in low - quality jobs .
i hope that this will indeed happen .
once the commission cfr is completed , the commission will decide on the need for keeping it up to date and on the best possible mechanism to do this .
we need to try somehow to communicate to them the idea of europe and the values of european unity .
as you know , it is up to the commission to propose or not such a specific directive .
in writing . - ( pl ) so far , during various legislative periods , thirteen european parliament resolutions have been tabled on the subject of climate change .
in the activity of memorial , these two basic components of russian public awareness have merged into one whole .
i would be grateful if you could clarify whether that is the case .
unfortunately , i must once again deplore the council 's lack of ambition and the systematic nature of the cuts it made to the commission 's preliminary draft budget .
citizens must be able to use electromobility across borders , otherwise they will not use this form of transport .
the european union guarantees freedom of expression and information in article 11 of the charter of fundamental rights and article 10 of the european convention on human rights .
the union cannot live hand - to - mouth : it has to have this long - term perspective .
they carry out some important studies giving us greater insight into problems regarding working conditions , training , the actual quality of jobs , and even the lack of democracy in workplaces .
the financial crisis added to this fragile situation in which these countries found themselves .
it is a victory for popular sovereignty : we cannot deny this simple fact .
numerical strength of interparliamentary delegations ( vote )
what motivates us is that we have fought collectively for months to ensure that there is a ' before the crisis ' and an ' after the crisis ' , that , in this internal market , which has facilitated the expansion of financial services and banking activities , and we are entirely in favour of all the cross - border work done by the sector , common rules and supervision are brought into line .
the task of the european union in this context is to highlight the principles of a union of values .
as can be seen from previous reports , in spite of substantial financial investment and very good logistics and management , european forces could not cope with simple police missions in kosovo and bosnia .
the draft decision that we are discussing today constitutes follow - up action required to ensure the full technical and operational implementation of the decision on which the council reached political agreement in june 2007 .
that could make a huge difference , also from the farmers ' perspective .
the dispute over the property of those expelled from istria , rijeka and dalmatia , if not definitively settled , will in fact make dialogue between the two peoples impossible .
these are , of course , citizens , who also have a right to talk to their members , and in this regard i would be very pleased if , in future , in the planning of the sitting we could schedule such procedures to everyone 's satisfaction .
the citizens must have access to the results of these evaluations .
this strategy highlights the eu 's commitment to combating terrorism globally while respecting human rights and to making europe safer , allowing its citizens to live in an area of freedom , security and justice .
accession of liechtenstein to the agreement between the ec and switzerland concerning the establishment of the state responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a member state or in switzerland (
secondly , from the point of view of children 's rights , the increase in the number of alternative family structures , which is discussed in the report , constitutes a threat against which action should be taken .
in the european union , we should always strive for better regulation .
in my opinion this is the only option for tackling the situation .
fifthly : what role is europe 2020 to play ?
that is the position of our group .
i completely agree with inclusion , not discrimination , but i am still waiting to hear from commissioner reding when roma camps will finally be allowed in her country , the grand duchy of luxembourg , for if i am not mistaken , they are not allowed there .
my second point is that there is a solution to ensure that israel finally releases those who must be released - stop the attacks , stop bombarding israeli villages , stop killing children , stop the attacks with mechanical diggers , and stop sending in children with pockets full of dynamite .
the opinions of both council 's and parliament 's legal advisers have also been negative .
the report goes on to deprecate , in the central asian republics , the ' anxiety to maintain internal control ' , which ' is a given in regimes which show little interest in seeking popular consent on which to base their rule ' .
member of the commission . - ( fr ) mr president , first , i will quickly say to mr van buitenen that i have indeed noted what he said and that i will certainly take his message to my colleagues , who will definitely reply tomorrow .
that is why there needs to be stronger strategic commitment from the member states at the level of local and regional authorities and community institutions in matters regarding the protection ...
for that very reason , i again urge the commission to review this issue .
( el ) madam president , baroness ashton , i think that we are living in an absurd world and that you have been elected to play a role in it , in order to mitigate this irrationality absurdity .
6 million jobs have been lost in the last two years alone , along with a worsening in the low level and instability of workers ' wages , even if they manage to stay in their jobs .
many demonstrators and opposition leaders were arrested and could face severe sentences .
this report will be based in particular on the annual implementation reports drafted by the member states in june 2010 .
lets us return to the legislative issue we are debating today .
there is a large quantity of cross border movement in terms of finance , services and people for employment purposes .
( de ) madam president , commissioner , today 's debate demonstrates once again how important the decision made by the european parliament on 9 september was , in other words that , in our opinion , france - a member state - was violating fundamental rights in this instance by discriminating against people on account of their ethnicity , and we called on you to take action .
that was , indeed , the right decision to make , but does that go far enough ?
in connection with this the financial needs of the investment are changing .
this is what we must put an end to .
we must immediately extend offers of partnership and help in dealing with this disaster - particularly in view of the debate we have just held on pakistan .
it would exacerbate the legal uncertainty that already prevails and further diminish the scope for national creative action .
the resolution will also allow ukraine to take part in union programmes and will define the implementation of new laws on gas now that kiev has joined the energy community .
how will this be policed ?
proponents of the treaty here today state that its primary purpose is to streamline decision - making powers .
the barcelona process : union for the mediterranean (
that would be an achievement , and i say this after 10 years .
the 2007 harvest will probably remain close to last year 's level and will lead to further reductions in the eu of private cereal stocks by the end of the 2007/08 marketing year .
by taking this position , we helped to destroy this joint government .
a first step in this direction is to simplify the regulations for operating the financial engineering instruments aimed at small and medium - sized enterprises .
they will meet privately behind closed doors and appoint the president whom we shall send to the us and latin america .
i declare resumed the session suspended on friday 24 april 2009 .
the economic prospects look brighter , but there are still major risks .
the demographic situation is not in our favour either .
let me start with a few remarks about the general issues you touched upon .
i further agree with the idea that the programming of the fund should pay particular attention to mdg - related areas such as health , education , respect of the environment and encouragement of good governance .
when it comes to energy policy in europe and the lessons to be drawn from the new information arriving from japan , i believe that we need to start by taking an honest look at the facts and realities .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see minutes
i should like to begin by underlining two fundamental principles which lie at the heart of today 's debate .
i would emphasise that we must also be clear on one thing , and that is that we must always make room for the initiatives that produce the best results .
through these extraordinary efforts , the croatian people now look forward at last to positive messages from the european union .
today in the european parliament , we have voted through the report on the potential of the creative industry .
in addition , the public services which are involved in the implementation of european legislation governing the internal market could appoint someone in charge of solvit 's communications , which would again boost the network 's efficiency and contribute to its promotion .
thanks to the group of the greens / european free alliance , an adopted amendment also calls for member states to recognise rape and sexual violence within marriage or any other intimate relationship , as a crime .
abstaining from voting is not a solution .
prevention , coordination and intelligence are the three words that sum up our strategy for tackling this huge threat .
let us take the debate and the decision - making process on the much - discussed and contentious topic of the reach draft legislation , which aims to improve safe use of chemicals , as an example : if citizens hear that out of 132 proposed amendments , 32 were identical and were accompanied by written recommendations from the chemical industry associations , if citizens hear this , they will of course steadily lose faith in europe , and they will have the feeling that european policy - making is simply there to do the multinationals ' bidding .
northern ireland also uses the system of proportional representation for european elections .
at the end of 2006 , when we adopted the progress programme here in this chamber , the member states set their respective aims and began work .
in a democracy , elected representatives must listen to the public , and the days have gone when animals need be cruelly slaughtered to obtain commercial products .
order of business

finally , i would observe that the commissioner confirms full commitment to protect workers ' rights and to fight against social dumping .
retirement age must be raised in stages throughout europe , and it must approach the 70 years of age threshold .
greetings to you all in the name of our creator , who created mankind from the same soil and through whose soul we have been able to become alive .
the next item is the report by reino paasilinna , on behalf of the committee on industry , research and energy , on the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council establishing the european institute of technology - c 6-0355/2006 - .
this bill would criminalise homosexuality , leading to punishment by imprisonment and even the death penalty .
i voted in favour of this report as i agree that there is a need to combat this problem , urging the member states and their social partners to develop new and effective strategies on job insecurity , taking into account the principle of gender equality .
in iceland , the myth of the economic miracle has been exposed and pressure can be heard for it to hitch up to the european imperialist chariot .
but , in effect , iran has now rejected a draft agreement proposed by the iaea and has been refusing to pursue talks on the nuclear issue .
the council started the ratification process for the agreement on 14 june 2010 .
we can help russia come to terms with its past .
other population groups have always been kept in opposition , where necessary on the strength of rigged election results .
i stand prepared to bring them to task should they fail to deliver .
the eu 's involvement must not be limited just to declarative political support , but must also contain very real cooperation and assistance with the implementation of reforms .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i was recently invited to a rotary club meeting , where a very interesting debate took place .
the damage caused by the anti - social policy of most eu member state governments will sooner or later become apparent in the health of many socially weaker groups of citizens , and particularly women .
the truth is we have only one choice in dealing with developing countries : we take their goods or we take their people .
following such a discussion , and with europe 's heart - warming efforts that are aimed at reconciliation , there has to be a future for north and south kivu and , indeed , for the whole of congo .
the new egtcs will serve to enforce legislation in member states , generate new dynamics in cross - border cooperation , and enable a higher degree of confidence and cooperation to be maintained beyond the limits of borders .
however , i appreciate your concerns about this issue of data security , and it is true that there could be a risk , in a third country , that data held at the premises of an external service provider might be the subject of seizure or compulsory search .
the commission 's targets are very ambitious , but we shall have to wait and see their finer detail .
mr president , i would like to congratulate mr van nistelrooij on his report .
in cases where access cannot be guaranteed on the same terms and conditions as for people without disabilities , we must be given a proper alternative solution .
it will therefore be up to us - to you and to us - to ensure the proper implementation of these mechanisms in order to protect the european economy in the event of distortions of competition .
i do not just have experts in mind , but also and most importantly vessels , aircraft and other equipment that will ensure effective protection of the union 's borders .
of course , when we are preaching that the main way for developing countries to fight climate change is by improving energy efficiency , we have to be very careful what we are exporting to them .
today , the debate revolves around greece ; tomorrow it will probably concern another member state .
vice - president of the commission . - ( fr ) minister , ladies and gentlemen , the european union - united states ' justice , freedom and security ' ministerial troika , in which mr mate and vice - president frattini took part in march , was an excellent opportunity to discuss certain important issues with our american counterparts .
a specific reference is made to patio heaters or heizpilze - ' heat toadstools ' , as some people call them in germany .
new jobs are being created : 3.5 million new jobs were created last year alone .
nevertheless , as mr őry observed , the commission can only impose itself in areas where it has exclusive competence and , as i have said , it has done this .
by the end of june , a broad consultation of the public and of the stakeholders will be launched .
the register lacks relevant information .
mr president , all these goals require a greater commitment by all : by the commission , by parliament , by national parliaments and by governments .
what i would also like to say is that , with regard to visa applicants , we sincerely hope not to deviate too much from the deadline that was set , since that is very important for us , and the serious risk of people ' shopping ' for visas at consulates may increase if we delay vis too much .
i therefore believe that parliament should consent to the eu - canada air transport agreement .
in other words , sanctions are being used as a means of pressure and political interference to protect ' friends ' and criticise ' others ' that the eu ( and the us ) indicate as the target .
we must remember that understanding the past of the whole of europe , and not only its western part , is the key to building a common future .
the commission hopes that the member states which still apply transitional measures to workers from romania and bulgaria will liberalise their labour markets when the second phase expires on 31 december 2011 .
of course , they need to be prepared for visa abolition and i do not mean to suggest here that we need to lower our criteria .
we must not forget that businesses are bound in europe by strict social and environmental rules .
closure of the sitting
is this reasonable ?
therefore , without coming back to a repeated request to improve and to simply the rules of origin , the possibility of creating a pan - euro - mediterranean mark would be a significant advance in terms of strengthening sectors built around the mediterranean and south - south trade .
the truth of the matter is that politicians from european union member states have given mr lukashenko a certain amount of room for political manoeuvre , without asking for anything whatsoever in return .
it is now time to act and to implement these plans in full .
if part of the thinking behind an environmental measure is that it should be a means of making money , we are already on uncertain ground because the measure is liable to be distorted for a variety of reasons .
- ( cs ) ladies and gentlemen , as we all know , gambling has traditionally been strictly regulated in most countries of the eu .
if not , the eu 's good practices will distort competition and disappoint its citizens .
that is why i would like to ask the council and the presidency of the council to ensure that this triad , these three pillars , are retained .
i would like to quickly raise another point .
the council recognises that the human rights situation in the middle east is a matter of concern .
we naturally respect the independence of the legislative process in afghanistan , in particular with regard to the constitution , which does indeed make provision , under article 131 , for the possibility of legislation devoted solely to the shiite community .
ensuring access to care for everyone , both citizens and non - citizens , with or without papers , is a basic principle of public safety .
it is also worth pointing out the historical responsibility borne by the developed countries for irreversible climate change and their obligation to assist the developing countries and the least - developed countries in adapting to these changes , including by providing financial support for national adaptation programmes of action ( napas ) as important instruments for adaptation to climate change which promote ownership .
the aim is still the same - to draw this european country into the sphere of democracy , a market economy and human rights .
in writing . - we recognise that sport has a special role in society as an instrument of social inclusion and integration , and as a promoter of local democracy .
the internal auditor has urged the council to abolish these accounts , but without success .
the fisheries sector is facing many problems , so research and scientific support work are powerful tools for the further sustainable development of this sector .

it was adopted in march 2010 .
parliament will have to make numerous improvements to this draft .
at this point i must warmly acknowledge mrs wortmann - kool , mrs goulard , mr haglund , mrs ferreira and mrs ford , who have been rapporteurs with me throughout this economic governance package .
this is possible on the basis of introducing a common political , legal and fiscal statute for political parties at the european level .
frontex , for which more allocations are being sought , is not just a mechanism for policing our borders ; it can also be used as a platform for the control of non - eu countries bordering the eu .
these are immediate responses .
it has not worked in the past and it will not work in the future .
that is why we speak of a tolerable risk .
( el ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we shall be investing eur 400 million in the marco polo ii programme up to 2013 , together with a great many hopes and prospects for a more efficient and viable transport system that will guarantee added environmental value in the european union , while at the same time combining economic , social and territorial cohesion .
it would therefore be worthwhile for us to take action again , as we did back in 2006 as a result of the oral question by mrs wortmann - kool .
overall , this is a thorough report that merits our support .
that is why i have asked my services to undertake a new assessment of the entire architecture and role of credit rating agencies .
however , i am not in favour of the internal procedure , which does not adequately meet the requirements for transparency and democracy .
i believe it is important to promote a healthy lifestyle inside families , in schools and at work in order to set the path for a healthy life model and to promote healthy ageing , both for the current generation and future ones .
to be frank , there are a number of bankers who are clearly no longer to be trusted and to whom we cannot entrust our savings .
here too we must - particularly when we are talking about universal services - ensure that it goes ahead , and that too is very positive .
however , many women have not complied with the regime .
he underlines the essential role it plays in meeting the lisbon targets and in the eu 's external relations .
that last statement , however , is highly questionable .
today fingerprints ; tomorrow forced work ; the day after tomorrow concentration camps - and then not just for roma but for any other alliance .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , next week 's european council must not be a summit like any other .
reciprocally , the union may also suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all its member states .
my colleague commissioner šemeta fully agrees that the office should concentrate on its core tasks of conducting investigations , although olaf also has other important duties to fulfil , in particular in the area of fraud prevention .
in view of the level of oil prices and the profit levels involved , russia 's oil exports by sea will grow very quickly in the future .
in writing . - ( fi ) the report by mrs gomes is a vital contribution to the debate on this major challenge to international cooperation .
the greatest illustration of this was in the truth and reconciliation commission in south africa .
we have started to implement a social policy by establishing the right to care for those who are disabled and dependent .
coincidently , gbp 2.9 billion is also the amount the treasury will save by increasing the debts of british students , condemning them to a lifetime of bondage to the banks .
i also share the rapporteur 's opinion on the matter of conducting an information and educational campaign on the subject of all european agricultural product labels which are being and have been approved .
therefore we need to act , and act immediately ; and i am very pleased that the commission has acted swiftly - and well - by taking some palliative measures , reducing the set - aside for 2008 to zero .
patients will have to request prior authorisation for some specialised treatments or those requiring an overnight stay in hospital .
a whole series of member states wanted the directive to prevent possible distortions of competition and to set a ceiling for europe in deposit guarantees .
what we needed to do was to set out clearly the role of the european parliament : we are a legislative assembly and not a tribunal on the internal affairs of the member states .
on our machines , you have to press ' yes ' first , then when you go to ' no ' , it is still blue .
in fact it is more dangerous during the second and third trimesters , which is what most pregnant women do not understand , because it is usually the first trimester that is the area of concern in terms of taking medication or drugs or any such substances .
we have had extremely good input from virtually everybody .
mrs roithová spoke about joint responsibility for the crisis , and i fully concur .
member of the commission . - madam president , i should like to thank very much those who spoke .
( pt ) mr president , let us be frank .
he has done a very thorough and excellent job .
secondly , the european union 's security dimension must be harmonised with nato 's to prevent any duplication of effort and shortage of resources .
you had hardly finished your speech with the claim : ' i am everyone 's candidate ! ' , before mr daul said : ' this is the candidate of the group of the european people 's party ' .
does the commission have any information on the budget deficit and other indicators of the cypriot economy ?
this agreement is based on a combination of gradual market opening and regulatory cooperation and convergence .
the international community is there .
for example , a few days ago , i read that amnesty international - not an organisation i always agree with , i should say - had this to say of the human rights , and particularly the humanitarian tragedy in north kivu province : ' the un security council , the european union and the african union are sitting on their hands .
to conclude , i welcome the adoption of the report , which shows that the egf is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis .
help us now to exercise this muscle , to enable us to rediscover a basis for decent coexistence in our societies in the future , too .
we should also , moreover , reiterate our refusal to sign a stabilisation and association agreement with serbia before the delivery of its war criminals to the icc .
the commission has been clear throughout the process , at least with me , that if the council and parliament had reached a more far - reaching compromise involving a total ban , the commission would have accepted it .
i should like to express my deep sympathy with european fishers , whose salaries have been directly affected by an increase in oil prices , which has seriously exacerbated the economic fragility linked to the irregular nature of activity in this sector .
however , most member states have a long way to go and a few others have not even begun with pension reforms .
effective diversification of energy sources and transport routes was mentioned in the european council 's community action plan of march 2007 as one of the means of improving security of supply .
in writing . - ( lt ) i welcomed this document , because it calls for a single strategic framework to be proposed , in time for the next financing period after 2013 , to ensure a common approach and to capitalise on synergies between all actions which serve on the ground to further cohesion policy objectives as defined by the treaties and are funded by the european regional development fund ( erdf ) , the cohesion fund , the european social fund ( esf ) , the european agricultural fund for rural development ( eafrd ) and the european fisheries fund ( eff ) .
i think this support should be very warmly welcomed .
we note the call for openness in the dispute settlement procedures and would like to underline that it was based on our initiative , that some hearings in wto cases involving the european union have been open to the public .
i therefore ask the commission , the commissioner and all the directorate - general officials to think very carefully about the feasibility of what is being proposed here , because if it is not feasible within the proposed period , it is not worth the effort that we are being asked to make here .
i believe that the forthcoming elections on 28 november are a huge gamble for moldova 's path towards europe .
( de ) mr president , the location for the eu - russia summit was not chosen at random .
take the labelling system for household products , for example .
furthermore , i appeal once again to the turkish government to ensure freedom of association and put an end to the systematic attempts to close down lgtb organisations .
after all , we commend the president of mexico - and those who spoke before me a moment ago also did so - for his determined fight against the drugs barons and the mafia .

to finish my speech , i would like to welcome the commission 's proposals to relaunch the european partnership initiative for adopting anti - cancer measures in the period 2009-2013 , in order to support the anti - cancer action taken by the member states .
the european internal market is one of the most important achievements of the process of european integration .
the indigenous peoples have a right to an unpolluted natural environment .
although the commission considers raising the retirement age to be one of the less painful ways of adapting to increasing life expectancy , it does not provide specific proposals on the employment of elderly people in the labour market .
this contravenes the right to privacy and looks like an attempt at censorship .
therefore , i am for utilising all means to integrate roma into social and economic activities .
generally speaking , the time - frame of five years was set up to prevent jeopardising the effectiveness of the work of the agency , which needs time to plan its work and to deliver on it .
i am basically referring to the principles whereby the member states should define and delimit the supply and content of the public service licences taken up by the corresponding public bodies , and should have the freedom to choose the funding model , thereby avoiding any distortions to free competition .
we are today approving the mobilisation of an aid package totalling eur 1 422 850 from the european globalisation adjustment fund in favour of spain , a country that has been badly affected by the global economic crisis and , in particular , has seen unemployment rise above the european average .

faced with such an intractable , callous and hateful enemy , what do we expect israel to do while its citizens are constantly subjected to terror attacks ?
( pt ) mr president , first of all , i would like to draw attention to the value that the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) , and especially the portuguese of the ppe group , ascribe to the upcoming council , to the solution that was found - which is frankly better than was expected at the time - and , in particular , to the work of my colleagues , mr brok and mr gualtieri , who prepared the report on behalf of parliament , in line with the commission 's positions , bringing the fund closer to something that clearly follows the union method and moving it away from what would be the intergovernmental solution .
this is an area with 100 million inhabitants and an investment budget of eur 50 billion .
they are now seeking to avenge their hurt interests .
we also support the further development of rural policy and increased focus on biofuels .
it is for this very reason , that is to say not listening , that we are living in dark times , as anticipated by the poet bertolt brecht .
i would like to thank mr chatzimarkakis for his excellent collaboration with the shadow rapporteurs and congratulate him on having achieved this very dynamic result , which augurs well for this important sector of our economy .

citizens ' ever - increasing mobility requires , on the one hand , more flexibility and , on the other hand , greater legal certainty in order to achieve this objective , this regulation must enhance the parties ' autonomy in the areas of divorce and legal separation by giving spouses the opportunity to choose the law applicable to their divorce or legal separation .
i must say , however , that i believe that what you have done , in seeking the agreement with the president of the czech republic , is right .
can we be satisfied , then , with the current economic situation of our rural areas and our farmers ?
i voted in favour of the financial assistance granted by the european union to ukraine as i believe that we must show solidarity , which also means aiding recovery from the current economic crisis .
in this connection , this very morning we reached a political agreement on the plan concerning the strategy for communication with parliament and the commission , and i am delighted to note that , differences aside , we share the same goal , namely we intend to ensure the financing of the european union 's policy priorities , whether in terms of competitiveness , cohesion or growth .
this is madness : cohesion policy is not meant to be a policy of handouts ; the so - called rich regions also experience many social and economic structural problems .
looking at the huge sums that have been spent on rescuing the banks , it is important to be generous to those people who have been hardest hit by the situation .
however , we have no objection to this topic being on the agenda .
( de ) mr president , i have voted in favour of this report and i would like to congratulate mr mikolášik on the excellent work he has done .
areas with weaker regulations or a slower rate of implementation could expose the whole of the global system to risks .
i did not get the impression there was any kind of alliance of interests between the french president , in other words , france 's most senior representative , and president déby .

then the china syndrome - like reactor that is wall street suffered a meltdown and the system was suddenly full of toxic securities and radioactive debt .
i therefore support the recommendations contained in this report .
( the sitting was suspended for a few moments )
i sincerely hope that these loans will also be easily accessible to small businesses in new member states , such as romania or bulgaria .
if i may , i would like to make some brief remarks on the individual reports .
law - abiding citizens in europe deserve to know that their own rights are protected against people who would seek to attack them .
who took the initiative of authorising this funding ?
of course , the european parliament should strive for legislative excellence .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , advocating and defending human rights today risk becoming hollow gestures , especially if statements of principle do not follow specific events .
( applause )
however , the mandatory labelling of feedstuffs containing genetically modified organisms was not supported by the majority of members , despite the fact that the citizens of europe have a very critical attitude towards genetic modification .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , apart from expressing my thanks for putting pavarotti first , i should like to say something .
this does not really represent new money ; it is just a redistribution exercise .
i would like to begin by thanking the european parliament for having included this item on our relations with our mediterranean partners in this sitting 's agenda .
the deterioration in the situation of fundamental human rights and its ability to destabilise the region through hezbollah and hamas are elements that add to the concerns that iran is spreading throughout the world .
do i think that if you want a serious trade deal you have to recognise that actually it is a deal where both sides benefit ?
one of the aims of this initiative is to provide parliament with more useful information to form a better framework for the interinsitutional discussions that follow .
in the summer period , its financial effects on producers are colossal .
parliament and the council will be kept fully informed of the selection procedure and the outcome .
in its preliminary draft amending budget 6/2007 , the commission proposed the creation of a new budget item - ' damage requests resulting from legal procedures against the commission 's decisions in the field of competition ' and the classification of the related expenditure under heading 1a of the multiannual financial framework as it refers to an operational activity in the competition policy area .
three out of seventeen member states concerned by the mid - term review have decided to use this possibility .
the commission , therefore , welcomes the adoption of this report .
as a result of the harmonisation of european union visa law , legislation which has often hindered the process of obtaining a visa will be repealed .
i personally come from a family which endured 40 years of exile - the same as the duration of francoism - and if we learned anything at all it was that no political objective was worth the life of a single human being .
i think , for this reason , we need to acknowledge that both europe and india have many enemies who want to destroy our shared values .
they have good reasons for so doing .
support relating to job losses , however , is provided in the eu at a european level only in the case of large companies where the job losses are sufficiently high .
there must be facilities , services and projects designed for target groups - the more differentiated and the closer to personal experience they are , the better they will be .
by the commission , as seems likely , or will the member states be able to appoint their own ?
( pl ) madam president , setting up a european agricultural fund for the development of rural areas is very important in terms of structural policy .
the entire food chain in finland is estimated to employ approximately 300 000 people , which is some 13 % of the employed workforce .
the objectives to consolidate the network of energy coordinators and to implement the energy community treaty are no less important .
mrs frassoni always cries : ' you want more bureaucracy ' , but i do not want any bureaucracy at all .
we should also attempt to come to decisions together .
if we follow this pattern , we could and should ban anything and everything that can be linked to a past accident .
the report she has produced clearly sets out the objectives : building up the market economy , supporting economic development effectively and creating energy security , in addition to creating democracy , the rule of law , welfare and security .
it would be odd , as pointed out here , if the european union were to have strategic relationships , strategic partnerships with russia , india and china , but not with brazil .
in writing . - ( ro ) i would like to welcome the initiative on compiling a report on the subject of good local and regional governance , as well as the importance of the notion of partnership between the four or more levels of power : local , regional , national and european .
the right of women to sexual and reproductive health is an important element in promoting development .
we are in the year 2009 .
at this time of crisis , it is all the more important for us to use all the methods at our disposal to combat tax evasion and fraud in order to meet the exceptional costs that are necessary to remedy the effects of the crisis and to reduce the high budget deficits as much as possible .
secondly , i would like to highlight what we are referring to as the mobility scoreboard , in which we indicate the barriers to mobility in the member states .
this house is about to adopt a report that would weaken an already very modest commission proposal even further .
madam president , i would like to thank all my colleagues and also the commission , the council and the belgian presidency for what they have said here , but i would like to emphasise three points that several members have also stressed .
on top of this , it is also being discussed whether rich countries should be allowed to carry over unused emissions allowances from previous years .
let me stress that , when we speak of banning political parties , of banning the public expression of opinions and positions , it goes without saying that such measures must not be based on political judgements .
i have to thank ms van den burg for organising an interesting presentation on that subject last week .
these problems in the producer sector - problems with negotiating power and the distribution of added value along the food supply chain - affect other sectors too .
sometimes we seem to have forgotten that .
for that reason , we also say clearly from here that we will use our parliamentary capabilities to the full not to prevent something , but to build something constructive .
i think that we ought to include an instruction that benefits the child , or rather , the passenger .
at the moment , a financial crisis has been unleashed , with an economic impact that is anything but modest , while the danger has increased of a deterioration in the situation of those already at risk .
the report shows that parliament , too , is opposed to the mandatory nature of these top - ups as proposed by the commission .
the copenhagen criteria , with which everyone is familiar , are the important things here .
now frequently , perhaps always , i disagree with the opinions of those groups , but they have a perfect right to express their opinions and they certainly represent a specific strand of public opinion .
we have got to look at the eu in the un system and in all of the other international organisations .
at this point , i must point out the action that is expected from the european union to combat the crisis , to stimulate the economy , to strengthen market confidence , with a particular emphasis on improving the level of unemployment in europe .
i therefore hope that we can agree on a more stringent line than that proposed by the commission , and i would like to thank mrs matias for her sterling work .
author . - ( de ) madam president , i am pleased , too , that this important topic - the increase in dyslexia - is being discussed here this evening .
it is gratifying that even in the current circumstances , this sector is one of the most dynamic and innovative in europe .
when we look at the history books , we read a lot about men 's heroics .
we often confuse dialogue with citizens with dialogue with organisations either wholly or partly funded by the commission .
i think that in the future , we will have to look at other forms of diet across the european union , because what i want to say to you quite clearly this morning is that while i am a great supporter of the mediterranean diet , i do not come here as the chair of the committee on agriculture just to support the mediterranean diet , because there are other diets across europe that are equally as good but have different qualities and different food .
i believe that the elderly deserve a chance , we have this duty !
let me summarise them as follows : the rule of law , the fight against corruption and organised crime , election legislation , strengthening parliament 's supervisory role vis - à - vis the government and broader involvement of civil society in interaction with the government , the reform of justice , with continual strengthening of the independence of the judiciary and prosecution , and tackling corruption , which undermines state institutions , economic and social development and the functioning of the public administration .
we should also be considering which tasks the commission itself can take responsibility for and whether an agency is needed at all .
it has already been mentioned that 40 % of people worldwide travel to europe .
the benefits in place in the united kingdom for the elderly during cold weather to enable them to keep their homes warm and combat energy poverty are an excellent example of what other member states , including estonia , should take as a model .
freedom of speech is restricted and the media are controlled by the state .
the full committee decided by a substantial majority that we should vote in favour of these candidates , so that is the recommendation from the committee .
the same applies to public procurement .
it was obvious that the previous model of growth was dilapidated .
i would also be grateful if commissioner piebalgs could let us know what progress has been made in the dialogue on energy security , on improving our relations with russia and on the implementation of democratic standards , which is something to which we would like russia to pay greater attention .
thanks to liberal democrats , the uk legislation implementing the measure says that the court must be satisfied there is no breach of the european convention on human rights .
there are question marks , of course , when people ask questions .
they ring our office , they know our assistants , they ask for help , and we do that .
we need dialogue in the field of environmental protection in order to conserve natural resources and nature .
member of the commission . - madam president , although the issue does not fall within in my portfolio , i feel privileged to substitute for my good friend and colleague jacques barrot , and to participate in this debate , because i am convinced that this is a very important issue .
i would like to emphasise that european citizens demand excellent legislation from parliament and , to secure this , it is important to provide its members , committees and political groups with the necessary means .
i advocate the same clarity when it comes to assessing the recovery plan adopted in brussels .
that is part of the balance that we seek and i am confident that we can achieve it .
written statements ( rule 142 )
with regard to the report under examination , a number of members have proposed strengthening the part on building .
disparity in how cross - compliance is administered from country to country compounds the resentments which it has built up in some .
finally , let me turn to the impact of the financial sector crisis on the economy - on the real economy .
we were exiled by the geographical chance of an ocean , and the historical chance of a pendulum that brings us together and distances us according to circumstances .
like the majority of my fellow members , i voted in favour of making the legislation on a network for the collection of accountancy data on the incomes and business operations of agricultural holdings clearer and more transparent in order to improve this legislation and , above all , to make the text more readable .
their situation is receiving our constant attention .
time and again we hear the council , and to a lesser degree the commission , talking about fundamental rights , human rights and democracy , but this rings somewhat hollow when we learn that state control of citizens is growing fast .
there are differences of opinion over the level of reimbursement and conditions of authorisation by an insurance company in one 's country of origin .
only six months are left before the pilot project launched in may 2010 concludes , meaning it is already time to draw up budgets .
this will also contribute to our goal of producing renewable energy cost effectively .
vice - president of the commission . - ( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , today 's debate has shown broad support for the common position on animal by - products , and this enables the commission to proceed with the next stage .
we have had three commissioners on international trade , two eu council presidents and the lisbon treaty .
in writing . - as to the 2011 budget proper , the council indicated that the level of payment appropriations should not go beyond an increase of 2.91 % compared to the 2010 budget .
the us demand for an end to subsidies to airbus , as a condition for holding negotiations , falls outside an acceptable framework for settling the dispute .
the objective of the commission 's proposal has been supported by an overwhelming majority of stakeholders .
i am also concerned by its increasing hostility to israel , our ally , as witnessed by the gaza flotilla episode and turkey 's officially published findings .
his holiness the dalai lama will pay a visit to our parliament tomorrow .
using the economic crisis as an excuse to weaken existing limit values ( when they have already entered into force ) sets an unfortunate precedent for other eu environmental legislation rewarding non - compliance and punishing those companies that have made the necessary investments to comply with the legislation in time .
that is why the transition from one situation to another is very important and must be supported using means supplied by the state , by social agencies , by the social partners and by the voluntary sector , so that society feels solidarity and mutual responsibility for all its members .
i trust that both my colleagues in this chamber and those working throughout the european institutions will consider these principles in the years ahead .
thus , its use within the 2011 budget is linked to the need for funding the " lifelong learning " and " competitiveness and innovation " programmes - within the framework of the eu 2020 strategy - as well as funding financial assistance to palestine , the peace process and united nations relief and works agency ( unrwa ) .
to conclude , commissioner , we are with you , but you must put up more of a fight in order to win over the commission itself .
a few years ago we devised rules enabling engine drivers to do just this ; today we are doing the same for wagons .
we need to get the unemployment rate down for women , men , young people and older people .
a few important steps have already been taken in this regard .
what we want to know from the commission is why this rapid alert system has again failed to protect consumers , and what the commission is going to do to put it right .
the commission proposed the codecision procedure and tomorrow we are to vote on the compromise agreed during the trialogue and bring this codecision procedure to a close .
the protests were ignited by the problems that most often stoke social discontent - poverty , despair and the arrogance of the authorities .
my final point , mr president , is that we also want the european union to be represented in the imf , the world bank and the global financial economy in accordance with its strength .
it is very easy to play the hero in the coffee shop , miles and miles away .
written statements ( rule 149 )
to always immediately call for help from the union is the wrong way to go .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , our group is fairly satisfied with these two proposals .
we should support the allocation of eur 5 billion to financing energy projects in 2009 and 2010 and to financing development of the internet infrastructure in rural areas .
if this is about the fight against climate change , then switching to biofuels will not be the answer .
with a few exceptions , it is still a matter of budget restrictions , containing inflation , and the stability and growth pact , even though 20 of the 27 countries no longer meet all the criteria .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank mr vondra and mr verheugen for their promptness in making these statements .
amendments 3 , 8 , 15 , 20 , 58 , 64 , 65 , 76 , 87 , 88 and 89 can be accepted in principle .
determined to convince china that it is in its own best interest to establish full respect for human rights across the board .
this is another document which has no connection with a strategy .
the activities mentioned usually help to strengthen social relations , and these are particularly important in a world in which there is increasing social isolation and separation .
let me give you an example of a pleasing result of this cooperation .
if nothing is done , the un food and agriculture organisation ( fao ) warns that the already high consumption of meat will double by 2050 .
subject : collapse in dairy prices on the eu market
the event which krisztina morvai spoke about took place in 2006 when these extreme right - wing protesters set the hungarian television broadcasting corporation 's central building on fire and ran riot for days , resulting in 113 police officers being injured .
i would ask for your support .
i draw attention in particular to the floods that affected many parts of england , including my own constituency of yorkshire and the humber .
documents received : see minutes

this has helped many finns to act as peacebuilders .
therefore , it is particularly important to urge the council and the commission to explore ways of establishing a transparent and legally sound procedure for authorising the transfer and extraction of relevant data as well as for executing and monitoring data exchange operations .
the modern world could not function without them .
currently no large industrial group is making investments in europe .
finally , mr president , it is neither reasonable nor acceptable for us to help to promote the very thing we are criticising .
thus , it is unacceptable for the commission to ignore the malfunctioning of the entry price regime , whose complexity encourages fraud , as the european anti - fraud office itself does , and for the commission to look the other way when the tomato quotas agreed with morocco are being contravened .
finally , it seems important for there to be particular awareness and flexibility regarding several sectors , such as the health sector , in which the public authorities have run up significantly late payments owed to undertakings , for regular goods and services provided .
moreover , an important achievement of the rapporteur and the european parliament is that , compared with the original council recommendation , the scope of application is no longer confined solely to gainful self - employed activities in the agricultural sector , since this target group also works in small and medium - sized enterprises , for example , or in retail , where they constitute a majority .
otherwise , state aid is only helping perpetuate financial difficulties in the european union .
in fact , the majority of the amendments requested by parliament , in its april 2006 resolution , were not taken into account , as is the case , for example , with the proposals concerning the possibility of the ep exercising its right of democratic scrutiny through access to sensitive documents .
the goal is clear , but we need clarity on how we intend to get there .
we should be there to help farmers and to offer advice on how they can do things better .
i should like to congratulate mr garriga polledo on the excellent work he has carried out on the important matter of the future financial perspective .
i am one of the rapporteurs for the financial supervision package , as is mr giegold , who is in this chamber and who is the rapporteur for esma .

in writing . - the situation in the whole of north africa is indeed dangerous , yet at the same time hopeful .
an increase of eur 2 million for the programme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the outermost regions , which means an increase of eur 570 000 for the autonomous regions of madeira and the azores .
the commission proposed a stimulus that it considers both necessary and possible in a situation such as the one we are in .
the special needs of migrants must also be taken into account , which brings me to the subject of language courses .
i would like to stress that , in order to strengthen human rights and social policy in international trade , we must demand that all future trade agreements provide for a ban on the exploitation of child labour , in particular , in the extraction and processing of natural stone .
we have voted no , with reference to the principle of subsidiarity .
( ro ) the agricultural product quality policy may provide a solution for many farmers .

on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that today 's debate and the vote that will follow represent an important stage for community policy on agriculture .
after the failure of the so - called ' lisbon strategy ' , which aimed for the eu to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge - based economy in the world by 2010 , we decided to consider whether the review of fp 7 might offer an opportunity to consolidate the golden triangle of knowledge , education and research .
salaries are also in something called the ' statute for members ' , and are indexed to the salary of a judge of the court of justice .
a code of conduct for lobbying activities is necessary .
in the case of the black sea in particular , this package will be particularly important as many of the black sea littoral states are on the paris memorandum blacklist or grey list .
the european union cannot stand by and do nothing to tackle this problem .
no country can permanently maintain the level of resources necessary to cope with such extreme situations .
thus , there are now eight more applications from four member states : slovenia , germany , poland and spain .
it is simply the result of the policies we have put in place : the agricultural policy , the economic policy , etc.
is this resolution directed against the hungarian government or against the european commission , which no longer has any problem with the law ?
but what we are doing here in parliament today is dealing with that , so i am delighted that parliament has passed that resolution .
we also need to clearly come out and say that we need more acts of solidarity and that training , getting people qualified , growth and employment are not elements to be played off against the social side of europe ; they are , in fact , a prerequisite if we are to combat poverty and exclusion and end the plight of the working poor .
on the treaty of rome , he wrote that he did not ask himself whether the treaty could have been better as it corresponded to all that was possible at the time and to the wisdom of the age .
it is hard for the member states to assess the amount of taxes and duties correctly .
for me , slumdog millionaire is an example of success .
it can therefore count on my wholehearted support , because respect for all people and their fundamental rights lies at the heart of the greens ' policy , irrespective of gender , age , nationality or socio - economic background .
further examples include the upholding of israel 's policy of apartheid over the people of palestine and support for morocco 's continued occupation of western sahara . and support for the illegal us blockade of cuba , condemned by the united nations general assembly on 18 consecutive occasions .
a high level of data protection is in the interest of every citizen and , in my view , can be guaranteed only by uniform regulations at eu level .
the ppe - de group withdrew its support for this amendment after the left - wing groups ( pse , verts / ale , gue / ngl ) linked their support for the del castillo vera report ( creation of the european electronic communications market authority ) to this issue .
this could be the first sector in which the european union does this .
as to the other topic to be discussed at the summit , namely climate change , i am glad that the french presidency understands , and i hope that it will take into account , the difficulties some states will have with quickly doing away with the use of coal for power generation .
in a medium - term perspective , such restrictions clearly send the wrong market signals , reducing the incentive for farmers to invest and to increase their production , and contributing to an imbalance on regional markets .
where are the difficulties ?
our most important proposal for improvement should be put into practice consistently .
i truly believe that we have to look at the social advances in european law .
the commissioner 's statement makes it clear that there are economic and financial groups and sectors in the european union that are going to gain from this agreement with south korea .
europe 's policy of systematically liberalising visas is an ideological attempt to destroy the european union 's external borders , after having first demolished its internal borders .
personal discrimination falls within the scope of our fight against discrimination .
please tell your colleagues in the council that , with this method of sluggishness , of ' yes , but ' and the refusal to put through better regulations in europe , we will not succeed in getting the next pieces of legislation on derivatives or short selling through .
i also endorse the communication policy it calls for .
to those of you here in this assembly with doubts , i say : look at how your own countries have developed !
this is an appropriate measure , which could mitigate the difficulties faced by the unemployed , given the right economic circumstances .
ensuring the european funds are spent optimally places heavy responsibilities on all of us : on the commission , when proposing legislation and implementing the budget ; on the member states in managing , day - to - day , some 80 % of the european budget ; on parliament and on the council as legislator and as the discharge authority ; and on the court as the union 's external auditor .
i should like now to outline briefly what has been achieved on each of the three texts .
the european economic recovery plan presented to us by the commission has been raised in many speeches , and is preying on many people 's minds .
it is not good enough for us to pursue a different fisheries policy according to whether we are in our own waters or the waters of a third country .
furthermore , ukraine will be able to request assistance from the union to participate in a particular programme in accordance with the general provisions on setting up a european neighbourhood and partnership instrument or based on any other similar regulation which provides for external assistance .
the commission mentions this in its evaluation report , and the discussions with the frontex agency and the member states on this matter will continue .
however , it appears to me that what the proposed amendments will introduce is tantamount to an invitation to encourage immigration through asylum , or an invitation to abuse the asylum system , should you wish to interpret it that way .
i would like to make three points , if you would allow me .
president - in - office of the council . - ( pt ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , mr borrell , i should firstly like to thank you for your three questions on this specific issue of the ban on cluster bombs .
with the lisbon treaty , the charter of the fundamental rights of the european union will become legally binding , which will make the job of the ombudsman even more important .
firstly , the real lack of interoperability , particularly in signalling ; and secondly , the railway industry itself - in particular , passenger operators and infrastructure providers who collude with each other to ensure that rail freight is placed at the bottom of the pile when it comes to pathing and timetabling .
may i offer them my warmest greetings .
today , the large number of opportunities available to consumers for accessing multimedia content means that we need to define the necessary balance between public service and private media .
( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i think it is paradoxical that instead of defending our jobs , the european union puts them at risk by concealing the possible consequences of its actions behind well - meaning rhetoric of humanitarian aid .
naturally , this house will be kept fully informed of the development of the negotiations which , i would remind you , are under way .
i should like to clear up one misunderstanding to defuse this issue .
it will just happen .
in fact , bringing an end to quotas will - as the adopted report admits , presenting it as a fait accompli - have extremely serious effects on the milk sector in the azores , and for the region 's entire dairy sector .
their political will , in terms of whether or not they want an accession procedure , will be judged on this point and not on military - type missions , such as afghanistan , which the report again considers to be an achievement of this country .
i would also like to alert the commission to the risk of micro - credit being abused for money - laundering purposes .
madam president , there is cut - throat competition in the world today .
due to lack of time , i will not expand on this subject , but i consider that , in order for the report 's objectives to have beneficial results in the economies of all 27 countries , not 25 , as specified in the text , it is necessary to perform the comparative review of their economies and , according to the results , to adopt a set of actions that would create equal conditions for developing the effects proposed by the project .
i call for greater investment in research and development into smart grids and battery technology , in order to make more efficient use of primary materials .
( it ) mr president , i am continuing the discussion on quality food .
we consider that the actions we have been taking for several years now are helping to improve it , but , beyond that , it is in our view the signing of a future partnership and cooperation agreement that will enable us , in this case as in others , to use the human rights clause to provide the best possible framework for addressing this issue with vietnam .
i agree .
i want to thank jacques toubon , neena gill and all my colleagues for their help and assistance , and am particularly grateful to mr medina ortega for his useful guidance and advice in helping me out of a problem with the spanish side of things .
however , it is difficult to come out of cover , because the party political network extends over the entire country .
after last year 's complicated negotiations , a tough fight up to the last minute can be expected over the budget this year too .
intimidation by officialdom curbs their religious freedom and they encounter problems in moving about freely and owning property .
i particularly disagree with the cuts made in the budget headings in support of the lisbon strategy .
the goal in doing this is to make potential beneficiaries more aware of these funds , and to monitor their use more effectively .
( pt ) commissioner špidla , ladies and gentlemen , we need to coordinate social security at the european level , hence this opportunity to debate the issue .
two declarations were attached to that amendment :
i mean that these are mainly questions of terminology rather than of true opposition .
i believe that this is also the responsibility of the member states and that perhaps your office should issue a recommendation on this .
in writing . - i want to voice our dissatisfaction with the so - called simplified procedure for the georgia and armenia macro - financial aid files .
nevertheless , it is our duty to consider seriously the situation of the least - developed agricultural producing countries while reviewing the criteria under which direct payments will be made in the future under our common agricultural policy .
they must be made aware of the validity of rulings , of appeal options and of the consequences of failing to respond .
at any rate , we must be united in our approach to russia .
i was up in my room because i had a problem , but i listened to it in the original , in your marvellous language .
on the other side of the coin , there is the fact that we , of course , want cooperation with the united states .
i rejoice with her and with those who have also said that there has been some progress , including in the area of police cooperation .
we urgently need this cultural strategy in order , for example , not only to be continually referring to our cultural diversity with pride , but also to be able to cope with the challenge of dealing with this diversity and the problems that arise .
we will not be responsible , but we will have played no part in preventing that happening .
( es ) madam president , at the beginning of his speech , mr van rompuy pointed out that within the space of 49 days there have been three decision - making european council meetings and a summit .
it is clear that a free - trade agreement will potentially benefit both sides , increasing the flow of goods and services , and enhance innovation and boost economic growth .
over the last 50 years , the population of this species has fallen by as much as 75 % .
why did we not adhere to its provisions ?
the dispute is not over yet , as we all know .
i am sure that with the help of parliament we can achieve those goals , and can achieve a positive outcome at the june european council .
the final document sends a clear message to the commission , which is currently in the middle of its internal budget discussion on the next financial programme : namely that parliament sees the future common agricultural policy as one that is capable of delivering for the european economy in terms of employment and growth .
this culminated in the adoption by the commission , in september 2008 , of the communication on a european union strategy for marine and maritime research .
( the sitting was suspended at 19.35 and resumed at 21.00 )
7 .
i voted in favour of this resolution , which draws attention to the need for proper collaboration between the commission and parliament and to the commission 's role as guardian of the treaties and of the eu 's general interest .
the government of mr rajapaksa has done everything in its power to prevent publication of the un report and it even contests its conclusions .
however , the countries of the south are not only victims of their own ineffective taxation systems .
the policy of evening out the differences between regions is working , so let us not squander its results with drastic measures .
a strong anti - russian current is seen as a red thread in the text . almost every idea which could hinder the normal development of relations between russia and eu member states has been included .
so , we need to understand what is useful and whether it is worthwhile continuing along this route .
when someone has been forced to carry out criminal acts , it is the people behind this who must be punished , not the victims .
it is important to ensure that the initiative is as citizen - friendly and straightforward as possible , without encouraging its misuse .
the commission and the council are opposing each other on the application to the financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide of article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union , and also to all the strategy papers and the multiannual indicative programmes .
the directive is urgent , because it has an impact on the period that began on 1 january 2011 , and it is highly significant in view of the positive results it is expected to bring to the sector in question .
i would ask them - this would be the message i would like them to pass on to you , honourable members - to show the utmost concern for this initiative .
in too many instances , road carriers apply the rule of using their own discretion , especially in the countries which have recently become member states .
moreover , this increase affects all countries , including those with very flexible legislation on gmos .
the combination of a smaller working population and a higher share of retired people will place additional strains on social welfare systems and economic competitiveness , causing increasingly significant problems in terms of gender poverty , given the high number of elderly women and current disparities in social protection .
we have a dual message here : pursuing the reforms undertaken , but also making the lisbon strategy more effective .
this is also recognised in our 2008 report on european security strategy ( ess ) , that we both mentioned before .
the reality is that russia made it difficult for international actors to monitor the last parliamentary election .
in writing . - ( fr ) for the first time i am happy to vote for a european directive on taxation .
either the council takes a unanimous decision or it takes no decision .
however , the commission is committed to tackling the difficulties faced by some providers of ssgi with the interpretation of the single market rules , including under the forthcoming single market act , to be adopted by the commission before the end of october .
this puts great pressure on some member states and i think we have a special responsibility to make it work .
the third , in tripoli , should consolidate our strategic partnership and finally yield concrete results .
the european parliament must take the initiative in this respect .
it is a fact that the european budget has been shrinking for decades .
it would also be a good idea to ensure that human rights are more frequently incorporated into all areas of the union 's external policy , including the external aspects of its internal policy .
few people are able to see those books , but putting them online will allow the world to study and enjoy their contents .
member of the commission . - mr president , i welcome this debate on the crisis response of the european union and on the immediate and longer - term challenges of economic governance we are facing .
this parliament has shown confidence in the ombudsman .
they also quote referendums that have given a ' no ' result .
as the rapporteur points out , women researchers are still a minority in the government and higher education sectors with both sectors having an eu average of 35 % women .
documents received : see minutes
however , the council proposal before us is quite simply too lacking in ambition and is toothless and thus redundant as it stands .
those who can offer visions of hope which allow them to get inside people 's minds - the swedes have been particularly good at this in the past , and in this respect i have every confidence in my former colleague cecilia malmström - can also inspire their interest in socio - political matters .

this is definitely an important report and it is good that you have asked mr monti to prepare it , as he is an expert in this area .
the whole process has been excellent .
divide and rule is an old and understandable tactic , but we cannot allow eu member states to aid and abet that strategy .
in a way that is good : the lisbon strategy is designed to run counter to the construction of a socialist europe .
i wished to know whether you were for or against this harmonisation .
obviously , the eu budget cannot replace national budgets or national policymaking , but anyone who does not adapt to crises is guaranteed to fail .
( de ) mr president , i would like to come back to the report by mr cortés lastra , which i think is a very good report .
without this , prices will become unpredictable .
this is why the copenhagen conference must be an international success .
i agree with the mobilisation of resources from the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egf ) for people made redundant due to structural changes in trade patterns or as a direct consequence of the current economic and financial crisis .
the economic policy conditions of the programme are member state commitments agreed with the eu and the imf on the measures that the member states will undertake in exchange for eu / imf financing .
earlier in the autumn , we abolished the visa requirement for the people of albania and bosnia and herzegovina .
i am doing so , firstly , because of the commission proposal to develop the strategy for establishing measurable objectives and sectoral partnerships to facilitate joint projects , among other important measures .
author . - ( pt ) madam president , commissioner , in a recent letter to the times in london , nine former british military commanders urged the government of the united kingdom to join those campaigning for a ban on cluster munitions .
the european union is committed to the absolute prohibition of torture and of cruel , inhumane and degrading treatment .
we are very quick to judge small countries that commit transgressions .
in recent years , we have done a lot to curb animal epidemics in europe , especially rabies , also through the achievements of the european commission , which first pushed through and financed the vaccination of foxes .
romania and bulgaria adopted the schengen acquis when joining the eu in 2007 .
i also voted in favour of postponing the inclusion of bluefin tuna in appendix i by 18 months , subject to an independent scientific report .
( oral explanations of vote )
we should be prudent with public money at all times .
we want a good agreement and we want this agreement very soon .
but i would like to reiterate : israel needs to understand that it must comply with international laws .
as regards openness between the member states , i think it important to stress that those who are against openness are also against free movement for people and freedom of opportunity .
ladies and gentlemen , the commission - and i myself - have from the outset followed and supported the work of the european parliament 's temporary committee on this well - known topic and on the serious accusations and serious events concerned .
i am not annoyed .
we request the italian government to stop the fingerprinting actions for minors of roma origin in italy .
the rule of law needs to be promoted , human rights protected , and the development of democracy and economies fostered .
i would therefore like to say very clearly that we want some give and take from our chinese partners on this issue - we want the protection of the cultural heritage of the uyghurs .
these are the reasons why i would like to call attention to the importance of taking actions to increase the attractiveness and promote participation in the eu education and culture programmes , such as establishing a special system for student visas , increasing funds designed for mobility - in order to truly cover the cost of living in an eu country , increasing efforts to promote european programmes , especially among young people , as well as disseminating the positive results / experiences both in the european countries and in the candidate countries .
the commission can agree with nearly all amendments proposed , which are either covered by the proposal or which are incorporated in the presidency compromise text .
we hope that before long , we will know more about aspects of food safety due to scientific research and progress .
it is a country which has no workers , no teachers and no doctors .
2 .
for many years , however , serious and often tragic reports have been coming in from reliable and indisputable sources about the persecution of christians on several continents .
can you comply with our request and confirm here and now that you will support this initiative ?
yet the crisis also means that cooperation between public international financial institutions is no longer just a policy - driven aspiration but a vital necessity .
that is what mr schulz said and i go along with it entirely .
it seems pretty clear who is attacking freedom of opinion .
indeed , we are taking the opportunity given to us by this annual report on equality between men and women , coming at the same time as the french presidency of the european union , to highlight a marginal but entertaining point which is at worst a lack of tact and at best a perfect application of the principle of equality between women and men , which means not discriminating between them .
in addition , shipowners suffer serious economic damage that their insurance does not always cover , because the circumstances are extraordinary and tend not to be covered by insurance policies .
i think that an integrated european programme is needed to suit their culture and values , bearing in mind that they freely move around .
this hypocritical pseudo - argument resurfaces time and again when votes are held in this house on texts concerning immigration or asylum .
this is evidence of a dynamic approach to the recent problem concerning mattel .
regulations should have been introduced in many areas at a much earlier stage and we have often called for this to happen in this house .
we then say , though , that we will be restricting this for political reasons .
i am sorry for that .
mr president , mr oettinger , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , i would like to make a correction : the german translation states that i am the chair of the committee on the environment , public health and food safety , but that is not correct .
this is why i very much appreciate the adoption of the territorial agenda and the leipzig charter .
we are the most transparent in the world when it comes to the press conference that immediately follows the governing council .
this directive will enable all patients to benefit from a certain number of rights which have already been recognised by the court of justice of the european union .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( de ) mr president , we have just amended the title of the debate , and because of the implications - on which there are divergent views - of the decision in ireland , it would be reasonable to give the house some time to discuss these problems .
let us therefore continue to support the work of this mission .
i must therefore say that what mr stockmann has achieved in his report - and my thanks to him - is a good list of criteria for establishing correct , properly substantiated airport charges , which also have to be borne by passengers , with a national supervisory authority acting as the control body .
terrorism is the word of the day in bangladesh too , and is the guise for violations of human rights .
it is also at this age that the foundations for the child 's future educational and occupational career are laid .
we are meeting again this evening to continue our discussion .
madam president , the jailing of the journalist roxana saberi on trumped - up spying charges is shameful and another appalling crime in the long list of criminal abuse by the fascist regime in tehran .
that internal political instability has denied the ruling coalition the time to implement its pro - european options .
( pl ) madam president , the aim of the common agricultural policy is to guarantee continuity in the supply of food to europe 's citizens .
i am therefore voting against this report .
we are therefore vigorously defending our right of control today because in future the commission must base its planning on what the legislator has laid down , not on its own communications .
many of the directorates general other than dg agri are working on the issue we are discussing today : dg sanco , dg research and dg environment . it is really a multidisciplinary issue .
- ( el ) mr president , this amending budget proves once again what is self - evident : that the eu has the mechanisms and adaptability to provide solutions to specific unexpected problems .
the european union cannot solve any of these alone .
the directive includes strict maximum limit values of cyanide concentration before this substance is stored in ponds for remaining residues to be broken down by oxidation , sunlight or bacteria .
the imo fears that data of shipping information with cargo details could , in the wrong hands , endanger ships trading with europe .
for it to be a success , the initiative must genuinely come from citizens .
we are thus against deferral .
so i would ask the members of this house to support this proposal , because it really is a significant change in european energy policy .
it is the same foundation for our future and , i must be honest , despite the feelings of friendship we may feel , despite the closeness that i feel towards all the people here , the european parliament 's position , the position of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe and the positions of principle adopted by these assemblies , i must say that this prize , the sakharov prize , and comments such as those that have been made , are a kind of recurrent leitmotiv , but it also calls for other , pragmatic decisions .
this reduction is worthy of particular note because very often expenditure on agriculture involves huge numbers of beneficiaries - farmers - who often have to cope on their own with the complicated procedure of accounting for the funding received .
this is an extremely severe accusation against the countries which we have accepted as members of the eu , which all fulfil the copenhagen criteria and which are all states governed by law with a free right to unionise .
as for direct production - linked subsidies , we advocate the incentives for reconverting tobacco production facilities .
it will be important to assess the results of cohesion policy for the period 2000 to 2006 .
the eu and the international community should put more effort into resolving the military conflicts in africa .
these reports show an understanding of the importance of regional policy as something that builds europe as a whole and that creates unity , both of which phenomena they deal with excellently .
when we talk about the european union - india free trade agreement , it is important to take into account the general context and complexity of our strategic relations with india , including the 1994 cooperation agreement and the joint action plan , to mention but two of the major initiatives and dialogues that we have established with india .
the commission 's effort to introduce common procedures on granting and withdrawing a unitary asylum status or additional protection through improving the harmonisation of asylum hearing instruments and improving the quality of the hearings in order to cut the number of revised decisions , however , is running into numerous objections from the council of the european union and from some member states .
later , he granted himself arbitrary powers via the committee on constitutional affairs .
in writing . - given the impasse in the multilateral trade negotiations , the eu has pursued the negotiation of bilateral and interregional trade agreements , as complementary to the multilateral framework .
i disagree with the commission 's attempt to limit the compensation paid to growers and contractors to just 10 % in the current package - allocating the remaining 90 % to processors seems excessive .
the eplp can support the main thrust of the rapporteur 's ideas and believes that many of the issues outlined are critical for a real recovery .
i believe that a common policy on investment will meet the expectations of both investors and the states concerned and help increase the competitiveness of the eu and its businesses and increase employment .
firstly , in terms of substance , dairy production in the french overseas departments would offer multiple unmissable opportunities : the strengthening of the cattle industry , self - sufficiency in a basic foodstuff and the creation of jobs .
i voted for the dess report , since i am in favour of a common agricultural policy reform that reflects the changing nature of the eu 's agricultural sector .
massive illegal immigration in malta risks altering its demographic composition .
i therefore believe that we should stop these artificial discussions about quotas and instead work to combat the massive discrimination that occurs daily in europe under the guise of the freedom of religion - this truly has no place in our enlightened community of values .
however , the sudden increase in the price of environmentally - friendly electricity rings some alarm bells , as does the fact that in large measure it is created using hydrocarbons .
i believe that these controls will be stepped up in the near future so that we can protect the public interests to which i referred .
i would cover the same ground as the commissioner but would put the issues into four groups rather than three .
( pl ) mr president , the problem of declining fish stocks is affecting not only us europeans , but also fishermen and consumers throughout the world .
in writing . - ( fr ) equality between men and women is a priority in developing countries .
we will have the bland leading the bland , but i am not celebrating because they will press on with political union and , whilst our leaders may have saved face for the moment for themselves on the international stage , they have all betrayed their national democracies .
we all know that strong , clear messages give something for people to rally around , and this is why the concrete targets and the flexible initiatives proposed for these strategies are so important .
therefore , during this period , we also want it to contribute to this democratic consolidation and to be able to organise itself so that it can really be a loyal member and a member that contributes to the mediterranean being an emerging area with democratic values .
there is a great deal of confusion today for the european parliament , insofar as we are considering at the same time , the europe 2020 strategy , president van rompuy 's working parties , the package on economic governance , into which this parliament is putting a great deal of effort , and a revision of the treaty to maintain a european financial stability mechanism .
a particularly important issue are measures to reduce the administrative burden in the european union .
the eu and canada both have a long - term commitment to assist haiti on the path to reconstruction ; to rebuild for a better future .
( de ) mr president , a few months ago , there was not only a festive atmosphere in this chamber but also a feeling of joy for most people here because the visa regulations were being eased for many countries in europe .
our group is delighted at the definite progress made at the lisbon summit but , at the same time , we would be lying if we did not say that our group considers that we still do not have sufficient political momentum and ambition to transform the european union of today into the european union that we need for the future of the european people .
this is what has been done as regards future financial programming .
the proposal under discussion will allow member states to levy charges with the objective of covering certain external environmental costs , as well as generating a significant income to be used for improving the european road network and minimising the environmental impact of some road transport .
as regards your first question , i must say that , within the framework of the convention on certain conventional weapons - to keep my speech short i will simply refer to this as the ' convention ' - the presidency of the council of the european union has , as you know , voiced its concern , on behalf of the european union , about the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions .
is this supposed to indicate recalcitrant behaviour ?
following my meetings with the groups , i am ready to take up the suggestion made by some of you , not only to meet your conference of presidents on a more regular basis , but also to establish an appropriate dialogue with your conference of committee chairs .
the latter will thus demonstrate genuine political coherence and will speak with one voice on the international stage .
instead of traditions and authorities , we have the individual freedom for which we have been striving throughout our modern history .
however , we must not forget that the serbian people were victims of this war .
only by collating the decisions affecting the seas and carrying out marine spatial planning will this be possible .
member states should be allowed the flexibility to be proactive and draw upon technological advances in vaccine production , thus reducing the burden on the agricultural sector posed by this disease and preventing occurrence without negating the disease - free status of the member states , as was previously the case .
that is why i voted in favour of the report .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( fr ) madam president , if the main european leaders wished to illustrate the gulf separating them from european citizens , they need only react as they did to the financial crisis following the meeting of finance ministers on 14 september 2008 .
oral explanations of vote
it was a task of nightmare difficulty in view of the widely varying expectations of the different groups and countries and in view of the fact that some of these expectations were not entirely realistic .
on behalf of the ind / dem group . - madam president , i am pleased that there is political will on both sides of the atlantic for the great partnership between our two continents .
making the charter of fundamental rights legally binding will close a chapter in the history of the fight for fundamental rights .
it seems certain that mr van rompuy , the new president of the european council , will not be joining us , and i regret that .
at the same time , the development of the european railway system will contribute to compliance with european policies in the field of energy and tackling climate change .
the group of the greens / european free alliance tried to introduce key amendments asking for the use of eurobonds , fiscal convergence and the application of a cap on financial sanctions and other incentives .
however , while undertaking the revitalisation of our own economy , we should not forget that the continuation of the crisis in the developing countries also hinders global economic growth very significantly , and therefore also hinders our own development .
in fact , due to the child - oriented approach of universal rather than targeted services , the involvement of parents and the improved integration of services , i voted in favour of mrs honeyball 's report on early learning in europe .
the next issue is kosovo , and we are seeing what can happen there .
however , we are fortunate to have such a resource available to us .
member of the commission . - madam president , i would like to stress that the 2009 budget negotiations have been very specific , very important and difficult as never before .
there are , however , two points that appear to be absolutely fundamental to me .
there is no safe way .
that initiative was very warmly welcomed by all those who had been awaiting it for the past 30 years - yes , 30 years .
secondly , i think that on the european parliament website under the personal profiles detailing the activities of each mep , it would be a good idea to also publish the amendments submitted by each mep in the parliamentary committees they belong to .
i would like to applaud some of the positive steps over the previous year , for example , the ending of the visa regime for most of the inhabitants of the region , the progress of montenegro , which has been awarded with a proposal for candidate country status , and the progress in the talks between the european union and serbia , which has been recommended for an avis .
it is also possible to promote use of the railways by creating incentives for improving the quality of service and by reinforcing the rights of drivers and passengers , thereby favouring modal equality .
at this time of global climate change and environmental troubles , it is clear that we need to address the issue of the european wilderness .
this was even recognised by the presidency during the negotiations .
we are also debating discrimination against women today , and when debating this strategy , it is therefore also necessary to talk about discrimination against women from minority groups in particular .
it will make it easier to gain support from the new countries for an increase in funding for research and development in the forthcoming union budget .
( applause )
so i hope to be able to come back to you soon on developments on this .
the vienna initiative has meant that action could be coordinated , including maintaining the positions and risks taken by private banks in those countries .
sometimes people who have not finished secondary school and are still under the age of 18 want to continue their studies under adult education programmes , but they cannot do so because such education is allowed only from the age of 18 .
this is a serious human problem .
particular attention must be focused on removing all those difficulties that hamper access to community funds and discourage people from obtaining eu financial support .
the proposal means that the weaker party , more often than not the woman , can now have solutions forced on her by the man , either because he acts first or uses coercion .
the way in which the whole commission proposal is written is very patchy and it is very timid .
the other point that must be made is that the european union has to deal with something in line with the overall context of the 27 countries , whereas some countries , particularly my own country , are suffering very badly at present .
the community can certainly benefit from such cooperation , realising and perfecting its own scientific and technical projects .
they are in addition a threat to an understanding of the real situation , which is both inclusive and firm with terrorism .
we are all gathered together in this house to stand up for europe 's industrial jobs .
this destruction had an obvious purpose : to remove all evidence that this town was inhabited by people of greek culture and the christian faith .
the market must be liberalised properly , and this should be the main objective of the reform .
in writing . - ( nl ) patient mobility is a fact , but the necessary legal certainty for patients and healthcare workers is not yet here .
originally the commission came forward with a proposal to ban this substance for individual use - not for professional use - and the rapporteur brought forward these proposals to extend this to professional use .
in writing . - ( fr ) i should like to send my best wishes to the czech government , which is presiding over the union in delicate conditions , due to the complexity of its national political situation and to a particularly worrying international context .
remarkable progress has also been made regarding the promotion of gender equality , especially the adoption of the gender equality law and the national action plan for improving the position of women and promoting gender equality .
during 2006 , 13 draft recommendations were made .
bosnia - herzegovina needs to operate effectively as a single economic and administrative space in order to ensure progress for its citizens and on the path towards eu membership .
the global energy efficiency and renewable energy fund was set up in 2006 with the aim of mobilising private investment for projects supporting energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy sources in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition .
of course , this cannot be done without defining ' wilderness ' , therefore i urge the european commission to take action in this field .
in many cases , company owners suffer more than their workers : to take risks while doing business , to create jobs and to pay taxes , they put up not only their shares , but their personal property as well .
this sends out a very positive signal to the effect that we are able to react to the situation at the programming stage and not adhere dogmatically to principles laid down earlier .
in addition , barely more than a year after the implementation of the reform of the common organisation of the market in cotton , the disastrous consequences of this can already be seen : production in this sector has fallen almost 20 % in greece and over 50 % in spain .
personally , i am pleased with the idea that the aim of the union will be to observe the clauses of the convention fully in all of its external relations and activities .
one of the characteristics of the european globalisation adjustment fund is that it seeks to promote the entrepreneurial spirit .
this shows that it is high time for us to rethink the method of authorisation of gmos in the european union .
in reply to the last question , i would say that we want member states to coordinate action .
subject : road safety 2011-2020 - special measures for school buses and their drivers
the report correctly points out the harmful effects of the global economic crisis on the situation of women , particularly as far as jobs and the gender - based wage gap are concerned .
there are two reasons for this : firstly , it is clear that the aim is not to alter the substance of the legislative text in question but merely - and i repeat the word ' merely ' - to remove the unnecessary bureaucratic workload , and secondly , such an approach will speed up the rate at which measures of this kind can be discharged .
what women really need is a genuine freedom of choice in life : they must have the certainty that none of their decisions will be given a lesser value .
so far , no coroner 's court has been convened to investigate the death , as would be the usual practice in the event of such a violent death .
this risk remains high to this day .
do more and cooperate more : that is the rationale behind the action plan that has been guided by mr perello rodriguez .
nowhere is such an active maritime policy more necessary than in the baltic .
( the president cut off the speaker . )
however , these initial measures , on which we will vote today , are not enough to support the producers in crisis , and that is why the committee on agriculture , through an oral question and a resolution on which we are preparing to vote , is calling on the european commission to introduce new and effective measures to combat the crisis and to support the sector .
mr schulz , i will simply say that my group and i concern ourselves with social issues just as much as you do , and we are all ...
the commission expects case - law of strasbourg and of luxembourg to develop harmoniously and converge in the coming years .
however , we must not forget that migrants without residence permits will ultimately have to be deported .
i would also add that those who believe that small towns , where everyone knows one another , are a safe place for children , need to think again .
this move encourages hope .
it also omits to analyse gaseous biofuels ; it fails to stress the need to encourage research into and development of biogas and does not mention the target 2020 programme .
there is no working inter - library exchange system .
but europe has a role to play in putting more pressure on the government of sudan to facilitate the deployment of these troops and the protection of the people of darfur .
we need to take time and evaluate the seven options in the green paper and make an evidence - based decision on the basis of clear impact assessments .
it seems that the vast majority of members who spoke are satisfied with the results that we achieved .
in this spirit , i believe that unlawful prisoner transfers , and the hypothesis that more or less secret places of detention exist - if such events were to be demonstrated in the appropriate manner - would undoubtedly constitute a serious violation of international law and fundamental human rights .
he has done so on behalf of the european people 's party group , and i shall do so on behalf of the party of european socialists .
i just wish some of the sceptics would not take such delight in putting forward proposals to delay action , proposals which might end up costing the lives of millions .
( fr ) mr president , i would like to express , first of all , our commitment to regional development policy .
i just wanted to say that , more generally , what i would criticise is that some people here are obsessed with talking at every sitting about how a democratic state should be organised .
mr president , minister , commissioner , as you quite rightly said mr németh , the council conclusions , in conjunction with the commitments made by the european union , need to be accompanied by effective measures to support the overall endeavour .
de facto , their transposition into binding community legislation would bring legal certainty .

in 1452 the court regulated prices and weights for various traders , including the cordwainers , and northampton itself has served as a home to the shoe industry for all that time .

the second problem ( which several speakers mentioned ) is the problem that has arisen with the structural funds .
globalisation means that the countries with young and growing populations will help us to carry the pension burden , if our policies allow it .
it is only a small percentage of the money taken from taxpayers ' pockets and then spent on exactly what the commission wants , with an added threat to publicise that this or that has been given to us by the eu or face a fine .
this is a given which we think should be reflected in the commission 's priorities .
the government has created a dense network of ever wider motorways .
the civil society forum needs our support , as we have described in paragraph 20 of the report .
let me just remind you that although 50 % of the dangerous toys in europe come from china , i am surprised that we have not discussed at all where the other 50 % comes from .
on behalf of the pse group . - mr president , i am glad that the commission is bringing forward proposals and i am pleased the eu is finally dealing with this issue , because we have known about it for a long time .

i would now like to mention some other activities that i have undertaken during 2006 with a view to ensuring the best possible service to citizens .
and finally , allow me to congratulate mr coelho who prepared the report , whose constructive and consistent work has been truly important in this matter . i would also like to thank the hungarian presidency for its commitment and the concrete steps it took to facilitate the accession of the two member states as soon as possible .
the plans outlined in this report are important . they will help turn european parties into a real instrument for enhancing participatory governance in the union .
nonetheless , i have to say that the idea of turkey 's membership of the european union defies comprehension .
this is why the social dimension of the lisbon strategy must be strengthened , supporting lifelong learning and skills recognition .
thanks to information systems and the efforts of europol and interpol , the hunt for criminals and escapees operates reasonably well , but we are repeatedly encountering problems in enforcing remedial measures imposed as punishment by the courts .

written statements ( rule 142 )
secondly , national minorities could be integrated effectively on the basis of the mutual shared , but asymmetric , responsibility of the majority and the minority .
this is a situation which undermines productivity and economic competitiveness .
my country , romania , has been in existence in its current form since 1920 .
lastly , i regret that the report does not take up the idea of an economic government .
i call upon the commission to complete the single market assistance services ( smas ) project as a matter of priority .
also , sweden , spain and belgium , who will be holding the presidency of the eu , in cooperation with parliament and the commission , need to make energy efficiency another european union ' success story ' so that we are on the right track .
however , at present scientists do not consider that the development of anti - viral treatments would effectively reduce the losses caused by this disease .
the other challenge is climate change . the data indicate that it mostly affects the poor .
that is why we shall support the compromises and amendments tabled .
on an educational and scientific level , these countries are making education one of their priorities .
our concerns about these and other parts of the report in no sense diminish our support for further enlargement of the eu , should applicant states meet the copenhagen criteria .
no , the work on equality issues - the equality strategy , the report tabled by mrs figueiredo - needs to take a comprehensive approach , but we also need a comprehensive charter for women 's rights .
unfortunately , however , amendments by the conservative forces which contradict the original text have altered it .
it is technically incorrect . it is perfectly possible to label and trace .
madam president , there is a new film on climate change called the age of stupid .

it is more important than ever that we , the european union , apply ourselves to our relations with iraq and discuss this issue with our colleagues in the iraqi parliament , particularly the need to abolish the death penalty .
i would recall the civitas programme , which achieved good results and may be an example worth following .
this is an absolute priority for the eu 's stability and security .
one example is the crisis in moldova , which continues and is becoming even more complicated , and is not being helped by igor smirnov .
in a first stage , we will present legislation to standardise eligible derivatives contracts , putting them through central counterparty clearing that is properly regulated and supervised .
the eu is not a state , it will never be one and therefore it cannot have a constitution .
for that reason , the alde group strongly supports the commissioner 's position and insists on maintaining the status quo .
it would be useful , however , to take a second observation into account in order to provide orientation for our policy making , and that observation is that all societies which work in a very efficient way with their energy and resources are very successful .
i hope all groups will support the joint motion , which calls for an assessment by the ioc of china 's compliance with the terms which were agreed back in 2001 .
we have done extremely little , and the governments we guide or support , even governments belonging to our own political groups , are doing very little to put a stop to it .
the second volet , of course , is employment .
money from the structural funds and , in particular , money from the european social fund is very important .
i firmly believe that it is vital to put in place mechanisms that allow the disabled to travel within the european union on an equal footing as every other citizen .
the report on an eu strategy for the black sea is important and for this reason , it is rightly very comprehensive .
quite the opposite , globalisation not only requires greater dedication to making aspirations a reality , but also broader agreement as to the form of the union 's policies and a new basic document with which to achieve it .
there are growing numbers of people who cannot afford the basic necessities of life .
the debate is closed .
president ma ying - jeou is to be congratulated for bringing this about .
northern ireland has been seriously affected by this and last year , the problem meant that replacements had to be found in the social housing programme for 500 out of 1 500 houses that were planned .
in greece , accidents are many and often , there are a lot of infringements and , obviously , if we do not manage to coordinate legislation at european level , if we do not manage to harmonise practices and to ultimately ensure that controls are carried out in a more specific and coordinated manner at european level , then unfortunately , we shall not be able to limit this massive problem .
i believe it is a good idea , particularly with the involvement of the roma themselves .
in this respect , council and parliament must together prove that we are able to conclude a codecision procedure quickly where necessary .
faced with the threat of having to fill their vessels with unprofitable fish , fishermen in the eu are getting an incentive to fish more selectively .
i fully agree with the specific reference to the roma population as the largest socially marginalised group and , at the same time , i endorse the view that interventions targeting the roma should not exclude other people who find themselves in similar social and economic circumstances .
our citizens have to be able to trust that these restrictions are also appropriate , however , and that their data are not being distributed throughout the world by the intelligence services .
the ppe finally resisted using renationalisation as an answer to the 2013 debate .
i believe that this work is best left to national governments , who are best geared to evaluate the needs of their citizens - as , indeed , the report says .
please do not tell us that labelling will solve the problem , because unfortunately the labelling on processed products does not give any information .
i also welcome the postponement of a decision over financing climate moves .
finally , mrs raeva , a new european action programme is currently in preparation for the period 2010-2020 .
today 's excellent debate has been no exception .
in the black forest - 100 km away as the crow flies - the danube begins and then flows down to the delta and into the black sea .
the question is , therefore , very dear to me because things that affect human security are always very close to my heart .
this is what i should have addressed first .
however , we do not want intergovernmental collaboration based around president sarkozy and chancellor merkel , without the european parliament and without the citizens .
it needs to move on from its obsession with institutions .
clearly , the emerging compromise on network unbundling is not to be seen in such ideological terms .
secondly , it suggests an eu - level levy on taxation areas .
however , i hear from a reliable source , namely a dutch ngo , that very little , if any , local expertise was drawn upon .
it is currently estimated that 1 % of medicinal products sold are counterfeit , but there are warnings indicating that this proportion is on the rise .
( de ) mr president , president - in - office of the council , as a member of the committee on regional development , i understand the importance of olaf 's work in the field of the structural funds .
i would like to remind everyone that autonomy is an internationally recognised , binding right , and the double standard applied by the european union when it says that some ethnicities have the right to autonomy while others do not is unacceptable .
i hope that it will be ratified tomorrow by the vote in parliament and by the council vote at the end of this month .
that is because the european union concludes these agreements in such a way that our partners , in this case mexico or the mexicans , represent not merely a market but a particular way of viewing things , based on principles , values , representative democracy , respect for human rights , and the rule of law .
indeed , investment in environmental technologies in management should lead recovery efforts .
whilst the intention to simplify contract law and expand cross - border trade is commendable , i nonetheless have doubts about the relevance of this approach : indeed there is a high risk that national rules , which provide maximum protection for consumers , will be bypassed .
the talks between mr christofias and mr talat are , as we know , at a critical stage .
the next item is the oral question to the commission by mrs berès , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the implementation of the single euro payments area ( sepa ) .
at present , the commission is updating this communication , as part of the commission 's overall strategic energy review .
i must say that i am very grateful to the shadow rapporteurs .
possibility of using gas from alternative sources in europe ( debate )
on the very day that the earthquake struck , the european council asked the high representative and the commission to mobilise all appropriate assistance .
do you agree that the lisbon treaty 's new competences are our best means to modernise our economy ?
this makes 7 percent of all the people working in the industrial sector of the community .
therefore , i would call for enhancing the role of the commission with regard to the economic governance of the eu .
numerous members said that we actually achieved a 17.3 % reduction in emissions in 2009 .
to discuss the future membership of an external organisation such as nato would only distract from this important focus .
lastly , on mr désir 's report , i think this comes at a very timely moment , given that a new commission communication on corporate social responsibility ( csr ) is in preparation .
nevertheless , in order to recreate a stable post - conflict environment , it is imperative to promote the development of an equal society that protects the position of women while avoiding the re - establishment of the ' patriarchal ' institutions that have characterised much of the past .
yet there is something new in the report in the way it brings in the conference of presidents as an intermediary decision - making body between the president and the plenary .
we have to try to develop relationships in europe that are based on partnership , but also on the principle of equality of partners , without , of course , forgetting to sound a critical note where needed .
procedure for prior examination and consultation in respect of certain provisions concerning transport proposed in member states ( codified version ) ( vote )

there is also the fact that working hours in the performing arts are long and non - standard .

these are smaller enterprises below a specific threshold which are to be exempt from the european financial reporting and annual accounting obligations .
this is the path to follow in order to ensure that the relationship between the european union and morocco is a positive one .
i look forward to the strong support of parliament in this regard .
the stockholm programme enables us to build on previous achievements and face new challenges , taking advantage of the new opportunities presented by the treaty of lisbon .
as there is no prospect in the near future of reaching a multilateral climate agreement , it is important to work at european level on devising a mechanism for restricting carbon dioxide emissions .
burma must move towards complying with democratic principles , and ensuring freedom of expression , freedom of association and meeting , a multi - party system and release of political prisoners .
following its established practice , parliament could decide to defend the immunity of one of its members if a suspicion existed that the prosecution was based on an intention to prejudice a member 's political activities ( fumus persecutionis ) .
that concludes this item .
the comments we have heard have been music to our ears as they have recognised the detail , the merits and the effort put into this report .
the fact that the airport user cannot delay airport plans will allow airports to begin infrastructure plans without delay and thus save them - and ultimately air passengers - money , as they will most likely be the beneficiaries of added cost projections .
as in ' framework decision 2002/475 / jha on combating terrorism ' - with its definition of ' terrorism ' - once again the possibility remains open for implementing security measures and criminalising individuals or groups who speak out against or write about state terrorism .
the member state of affiliation must ensure that its nationals have access to information .
all european flag states must , without exception , be on the white list and be in possession of instruments designed for this purpose .
in writing .
thirdly , in order to reduce air pollution even further , neither short - term actions such as road blocks and traffic bans , nor stricter , paper - based limits will lead to success .
despite this concern , we agree - as stated above - with the general ideas of the report and think it is very helpful .
this ensures that the whole sector and the whole framework of maritime safety have today taken a step forward .
i think that it is vital to support all initiatives that are aimed at encouraging dialogue and mutual respect between communities and which seek to safeguard fundamental rights such as freedom of thought , conscience and religion .
in this context , freezing the eu funding for bulgaria until the cases of corruption have been cleared up sends out an important signal .
( the amendment was rejected )
minister billström , you have said that we need some checks and balances on our external borders but , i ask you , why cannot we have some checks and balances on those people who are working and defending our external borders ?
( es ) mr president , as a first response to the financial crisis of august 2007 , the adoption of this directive should not be delayed .
it is only by facilitating trade flows that you can expect regional trade to take place .
the outcome of the copenhagen conference has obviously left a feeling of dissatisfaction , but i refuse to call it a failure .
in general , i must say that i agree with the commission 's approach , which welcomes diversification , that is , pension systems resting on multiple pillars , but , at the same time , i would like to point out that the wording could be a little more precise here .
others have been overtaken by virtue of the first presidency compromise text or because the proposed amendments are already provided for elsewhere in the regulation or in some other legal provisions .
we should be able to turn a blind eye to rules which are directly or indirectly intended to protect the population or businesses active locally .
clearly there is pressure in that regard at the moment , but the fact is that greece enjoyed major rate advantages thanks to being in the euro area .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the issue of providing adequate financial resources to guarantee the decommissioning of nuclear power plants has already been tackled by european union legislation on the safety of the nuclear sector .
a great deal of research and funds are therefore required from europeans in order to learn more about the seas , and if we now bring these into being in connection with the european maritime day , we have done something good .
mr president , there is one thing at least that we should agree on in this house , namely that too many are without jobs today .
this year has seen a 50 % increase in the number of petitions received compared to 2006 .

the new partnership must bring together civil societies much more systematically , and also the people 's representatives , in other words the parliaments , especially by assisting with the capacities of african parliaments .
, in writing . - ( hu ) mercury is one of the best known and most dangerous of the heavy metals .
you are not telling the truth !
mr president , this is just to put the record straight , as my name was cited by my colleague , mr tannock .
these scientists , one by one , demolished the so - called facts about man - made global warming , with scientific argument as opposed to alarmist sound bite .
firstly , our aspirations for the budget review itself .
i therefore say this as a friend .
we do not need mandatory product bundling or product integration which would simply push up the price of insurance and restrict consumer choice .
i ask you now about the ' state of europe ' which various people are preaching about and i wonder , where are its borders , what are these certain territories and where is its defence when its defence is in the hands of a large - unfortunately american - army and where is its foreign policy when we have a middle east in flames , a terrorist greenhouse exporting terrorism , the refugees and victims of which are not on their way to alabama or arizona or kentucky but , unfortunately , are coming to greece , to cyprus , to germany and to spain ?
you will naturally ask me : why this approach for gdańsk ?
any move to improve the quality and availability of information , especially on agricultural policy and structural funds ( which has proved difficult for the public to obtain ) , is a positive step towards the eu assuming its democratic obligations .
in this perceptive , i should hope that gathering data will not become a purpose in itself .
we have successfully amended both reports , and will be supporting both of them when it comes to the vote .
this is especially relevant in the current crisis , when sensitivity in considering questions important to business is a true necessity .
today is not the right time to deliberate , for example , about who should control the airport in the capital of haiti .
i invite eu universities to offer these brave young people alternative options to continue their studies , to facilitate the provision of visas and to add to the eu blacklist the names of those university officials who have consented to use them as tools in the lukashenko oppressions .
the deployment is continuing and , as i said in my introduction , we do not expect the overall time frame of the operation to be affected .

they were simple statements that happened to agree with us on this particular question .
it has not just improved the job prospects of the young people who attend , but it has revitalised an entire region of north wales .

i should like to mention to all of you that if you make your speeches at a very fast pace , the interpreters have trouble keeping up with you .
do the americans want to observe the same balance when it comes to security and human rights ?
this seems to me very strange .
we can talk about sanctions , and the time will come for this .
( fr ) mr president , i have two points .
the blue card concept transforms people ( who are immigrating ) into economic factors and represents a concept of ' selective immigration ' .
whereas until recently we were talking of frozen conflicts , the situation is now such that these risk becoming dormant conflicts ; and we must of course all take care that they do not become open conflicts .
the position of the council and of the commission and the resolution of the european parliament on the situation in belarus have the objective of evaluating the results of the parliamentary elections held on 28 september , and also their impact on eu relations with belarus .
i also want to work more closely with the european investment bank to look at innovative forms of financing .

according to the united nations panel on climate change ( ipcc ) , the industrial nations need to cut their absolute emissions by 25 % to 40 % by the year 2020 .
secondly , i think it is also important to condemn - and this is what the resolution does - the use of torture in these countries , as in others , in the strongest , toughest , clearest and firmest way possible , even when this occurs in the european union , which , unfortunately , is sometimes the case .
no excessive violence can be excused , yet we have to look deeper into the origins of the conflict .
we all know this is a difficult issue .
if the european union is to compete with third countries , if its economy is to grow , if there is to be a higher employment rate and fewer differences between regions , then we need to promote lifelong learning .
this is why i will be voting against this report , the sole acknowledged political aim of which is to pander to the propaganda of the euro - globalists .
most importantly , however , i would like to highlight the fact that the friedrich - naumann foundation in germany , a foundation which has close links with the german free democratic party , was involved in the coup in honduras .
in discussions it is sometimes hard to distinguish naïve wishful thinking from calculating pragmatism .
( sv ) madam president , i should like to respond to mr obermayr 's question .
i am entirely in agreement with you , and we will see what action is to be taken .
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - ( fr ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first i would like to emphasise the significance of this joint debate on smes and i sincerely hope that the smes will hear the strong signal that our parliament wishes to send out to them .
the euro has not been the problem .
the taxing of financial transactions is something that the socialists and the left in europe have long been fighting for .
they enabled a broad consensus to be achieved within our committee .
( parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment )
it is also proposed that we should have a common support service to help the small agencies with burdensome administrative tasks .
nevertheless , we must also look to the future , of course .
with regard to crimes involving violence against women , i believe it would be worth considering the introduction of a single european emergency telephone number , which could be called to obtain support or report a crime of this kind .
however , madam president , i do not believe that we should deceive ourselves .
in this sense it is vital that the european union adopts mechanisms to combat corruption in the exploitation of minerals , as several members have argued , particularly through the petition online at www.stopcorruption.eu , which i would like to invite everyone to sign .
at the same time , though , we are not taking away the right of the member states to make their own decisions regarding their export policies in this sensitive sector .
proof of this are the circumstances which led to the death of the cuban prisoner and patriot , orlando zapata .
we have now seen the price farmers receive for wheat go up by only 10 % , while the shelf price in supermarkets of wheat - based products has gone up by 40 % .

climate change , the fossil fuel burden and a way of life that involves high energy consumption , those are our adversaries - internal and external .
the international community now has a duty to contribute to drawing up a strategy of reconstruction for the country which will be sustainable in the short , medium and long terms .
natural disasters have an incalculable cost in terms of human lives and economic infrastructures .

this makes it clear that the reunification of germany was by no means just a national matter , but also a fundamental european issue .

this will help supplement the information contained in the single permit , thereby facilitating monitoring .
the service should be established pursuant to democratic standards , and i expect parliament to play a significant role here , both in the establishment process and later in the interviewing of candidates for heads of delegations , together with the committee on foreign affairs .
i hope it will be a success .
commissioner oettinger has already appeared in plenary a couple of times to set forth what he stands for and what he wants to do .

( de ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , this revision of the design directive revolves around the question of whether or not the protection that is rightly afforded to the design of car bodies should be extended to matching visible spare parts , such as wing mirrors and headlights .
however , i think that biometric passports do not need to be a condition for not being included in the visa waiver programme .
several important projects have been carried out , and the results of these initiatives must be followed up in an appropriate manner , allowing the development of a common model of indicator with eurostat , with the agencies of the european union , europol , eurojust , frontex and the agency for fundamental rights .
accordingly , in the committee discussions prior to second reading , we tried to identify areas of the common position to which we could make improvements .
the rapporteur would also like the european parliament to have a greater responsibility for the structure and function of the european development fund .
looking at the content of the mandates and of the pnr agreement , the council is aware that the most important thing with regard to the three agreements is ensuring a sufficiently high level of data protection .

the possible reduction in duties for the next three years on clothing products from pakistan risks plunging the manufacturing sector into an even greater crisis than the one we are currently experiencing , with the loss of 120 000 jobs across europe , and 40 000 in italy alone .

in writing . - i am opposed to moves towards a common immigration and asylum policy in europe .
i do not agree with the short timeframe which some member states felt was adequate for the special tests .
however much the commission has said that it will not be a precedent , the pressure will be there .
mr president , once again , i note that there is a consensus in parliament .
the industry itself cannot explain why a cloned animal has the cell of the parent - an older cell .
is there a new green deal or do you indeed wish to pursue the strategies of the last decade ?
ensure comparability of all elements and relations between internal and external imbalances .
i am glad that we are broadening this principle to include the neighbouring countries of south - east europe .
that does not bode very well for the financial perspective for the 2014-2020 period with which parliament so badly wants to be involved .
be that as it may , the important thing is that we have a date .
in future , the national and regional parliaments must also , i believe , be consulted much more systematically on the process of drafting regional and national strategy documents .
composition of parliament : see minutes
a european perspective and new steps are essential for responding to these needs and especially for adequately tackling the supervision of cross - border groups and moving forward with the prevention and management of international crises .
second , will you name a date for macedonia this year ?
we must confront the moldovan authorities .
in this context , i would like to address commissioners hübner and potočnik .

we must make every effort to ensure that cooperation is extended in various areas of economic and technical activity , and this includes enhancing the process of economic development .
the aim of epas is to strengthen acp economies to help them move into the world economy .
everyone here will surely have in mind the improvements brought to the daily life of people of portugal , spain , ireland and all the countries of europe thanks to our cohesion policies .

rapporteur . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i think that this very interesting debate , which follows on from the one we had in the special committees , shows that there is a great consensus in this parliament as regards the fundamental strategies .
we have now included inspection requirements in our proposal to revise the ippc directive .
we called upon the government and the opposition to observe human rights , freedom of speech and freedom of association .
however , what i do not understand is why , at this point in time , after the treaty of lisbon has been ratified , the council has failed to make more of an effort to coordinate the budget , i.e. budget items , with parliament .

in 2007 , the european parliament was asked for the first time to give its opinion regarding the conclusion of this protocol .
that is the only kind of approach that can eliminate the causes of the obstacles and speed up the process of croatia 's accession .
wars , ethnic tensions , persistent climate change , human rights violations , a lack of civil and economic liberties , endemic corruption , a lack of institutional representatives of citizens ' needs , such as trade unions , associations , political parties : the set of all these elements represents the field of deployment of european foreign policy and resolving these problems will remove many of the reasons that cause millions of people to emigrate .

the truth is that you want , at any price , and against the wishes of the peoples of europe , to continue the negotiations for turkey 's accession to the european union , despite turkey 's continuing refusal to recognise cyprus and despite the fact that the democratic reforms are at a standstill .
we can also be reasonably satisfied about the level of coordination that has existed between the various european representatives on the g 20 : the european countries that are g 20 members and participate in the g 20 meetings as such , plus the presidency of the european union together with the commission , the latter representing the voice of all europeans and the common position of all member states .

this has not been done so far .
the agreements reached in kyoto , bali , etc. have proved ineffective : their primary objective is not environmental protection , but the protection of capital and its profits .
nevertheless , in addition to the reservations that we always express in these situations , there are particular aspects of this process that need to be stressed .
i find , however , that the objective of forced prostitution and the commercial sexual exploitation of women needs constantly to be at the forefront of society 's and the public 's focus .

i would like to see more emphasis placed on youth unemployment .
what have these negotiations achieved ?
we are working very hard here to deliver the framework , but how hard are you really working in the member states to ensure that companies take advantage of that ?

i agree with the position set out in the resolution that the european union should take a leading role in the climate negotiations and actively contribute to a more constructive climate conference in cancún .
this own - initiative report should be viewed from the perspective of the legislative debate under way aimed at amending the regulations relating to the structural funds and , in particular , the erdf regulation ( angelakas report ) and the esf regulation ( jöns report ) .
the french will abolish it .
i would very much like to hear from the council what it plans to do in concrete terms to restore relations .
it is interesting that when food prices are rising , the commission will act to look at it and i would urge the commission to come up with statistics that show us the share - out of the final retail price between producer - and i mean farmers - and consumer , because that information is not available .
even the most out - of - touch meps have clearly realised that exposés of fraudulent pseudoscience and record cold winters across the globe have made the public , rightly , very sceptical about all the deceitful propaganda about drowning polar bears .

your vote this week is excellent news ahead of the prague employment summit .
we should realise that advertising policy , especially in relation to men and women , is putting a brake on the process of harmonisation of working and family life , since it very often presents a picture of a woman who is happily and smilingly on top of all her , sometimes conflicting , tasks arising out of her different social roles , very often performed under considerable time pressure .
so i guess she is perfect for this european union .
moreover , the european union is insisting on an increase in the target for reducing emissions to 30 % in 2020 , provided that other developed countries commit to comparable reductions in emissions .
mr hoang ngoc , your statement will be noted in the minutes .
working to digitise works of oral literature , which are often collected by teams of ethnologists and anthropologists , and encouraging free access to them through the europeana project , thereby making them universal in scale , would be a way of protecting and giving life to humanity 's cultural diversity , to which we are all attached .
i should also like to highlight the importance of carrying out a complete inventory of the sources of information because it is only possible to proceed in an appropriate way if there is accurate information .
these instruments are urgently needed .
madam president , today 's discussion on sudan and south sudan is encouraging and positive in a world where there is more bad news than good news .
the social fund can finance , among other things , counselling , training adapted to the specific needs of people with disabilities , rehabilitation , job creation in sectors such as social economy , special support to promote entrepreneurship among persons with disabilities , and awareness raising campaigns to combat discrimination .
we did so in cancún , but we must also do so with regard to the reduction targets .
the commission is pleased that this debate is being held on the implementation and evaluation of this important instrument for the common foreign and security policy .

the stabilisation of the economic and financial situation does not mean that the recession is over , however .

at the same time i would like to remind you that the european union has not been sufficiently active in advocating the rightful interests of its new member states regarding us visa exemptions .
in most member states , the laws prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages to young people are adequate ; the problem is the low level of compliance .

in fact , it was a wrong vision blocking a deeply political aspect .

they represent a serious and dangerous problem that drags down the quality of the tender system , seriously undermining the survival of small businesses and contributing to the european economy 's loss of competitiveness .

let me say again that the slovenian presidency will do everything in its power to achieve a balance between the various interests , and also to ensure that the solutions we accept will make the european road transport industry more efficient and more competitive .

we should also find a way to control what we are importing from other countries outside the eu , especially in some northern european ports .
the rules on vaccination that applied at that time need to be adapted to technological developments in order to combat bluetongue more effectively and reduce the burden on farmers .
interpretation of the rules of procedure : see minutes
on behalf of the pse group . - ( hu ) thank you very much .
i should also like to comment on parliament 's amendment proposing a broader definition of ' legal timber ' .
agenda of the next sitting : see minutes
there have for some time been rumours in the world of high finance about italy exiting from the euro .
in writing . - ( el ) the aim of economic and social cohesion is to create a delusion among workers so that the gap in social and regional disparities can be narrowed , and the living standards of workers in countries and regions that diverge from the community average can be raised .
in my country , austria , many thousands of workers are directly or indirectly affected by the crisis .
in a way it is a supportive measure to the eu development cooperation policy , as the blue card workers eventually return to their countries of origin with the experience that is vital for progress .
you do not have a consistent strategy combining economic , social , trade , industrial , agricultural or research policies to guarantee sustainable and fair development .
this was the message from various leaders at the recent united nations meeting .
that is why , in the aim of safeguarding the old institution and promoting the validity of the new institution , we felt that the transitional provisions in article 18 in the commission 's proposal were not needed .
i realise that the time is up , but europe 's time for shame is not up , it has come back , so beware , ladies and gentlemen .
in the words of aristotle , it is not about outward appearance but about inward significance .
i advocate that we vote against the ppe and that we adopt the socialist report now that the socialists have withdrawn the amendment , for reasons perhaps better known to some of those in the southern part of europe .
disasters definitely have no national borders .
we therefore need to take urgent action : the 2004 directive must be revised in the light of these results .
the opening up of air space between the us and eu on a non - discriminatory basis should provide improved services for the transportation of passengers and cargo , economic benefits , and above all jobs .
( da ) mr president , it is with great pleasure that i am following the renewed interest in green growth that has followed in the wake of the financial crisis .
how are we , as the european union - and i will make myself absolutely clear : as the european parliament and council ; in other words , together with the member states - supposed to ensure this protection if it is the case that while we , as the european union , are negotiating with third countries on the forwarding of data - over what data is actually required , the purpose for which it is to be used and the safeguards that are necessary in order to protect this data - at the same time , individual member states are negotiating with third countries on data ? especially since we do not even know what data they are talking about , what security standards are being maintained , whether duplicate data is possibly being forwarded , or even whether data is being forwarded that we would not allow to be forwarded at european level .
this consolidation should not , however , hinder competition to the extent of impairing the effective operation of the common market .
for our group , this means , above all , finally establishing a common legal immigration policy which safeguards the human rights of migrants and offers prospects to people in great need who enter europe , often risking their lives to do so .
the problem of liquidity and leverage ratios has not been resolved , any more than that of off - balance sheet assets and securitisation .
however , the people in sarajevo and banja luka know what europe means and they are the ones who need our help .
two centuries later the romans said ' man is a wolf to his fellow man ' .
madam president , i welcome the commission 's statement tonight and look forward to reading in more detail exactly what is in this package .
in writing . - i voted against the schengen acquis being extended to encompass bulgaria and romania simply because i do not think provisions have been made to make sure they adjoin the passport - free area safely and effectively .
i believe that we are the ones who can still save this planet .
in many of our national parliaments , there are central lobby areas where lobbyists who have appointments can be greeted and escorted to members ' office areas .
( fr ) mr president , a few days after the positive referendum in ireland , i really feel that we can say that we are more european today than we were before .
yet , we have proof , once again , that supporting authoritarian and corrupt regimes for the sake of stability and preventing chaos usually ends in instability , chaos and the loss of great opportunities for the future .
steps must be taken beforehand to ensure that the member states concerned have fully mastered the task of protecting their external borders .
thank you .
portugal still has the five longliners it had before .
some test results from the agriculture ministry in schleswig - holstein have shown that the fat in the feed contained 77 times the approved amount of dioxin .
russia imposed tariffs on cars , china restricted food imports , india banned imports of toys and argentina introduced import licences for textiles and leather goods .
3 .
given the recent history of my country i have focused in particular on the tragedy of totalitarian communist rule .
therefore , i consider that we must prioritise alternative conflict resolution procedures , since they offer more flexibility , as well as simplified and less costly legal proceedings .
( fr ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to say very quickly that we deplore all the horrors of darfur and that we all demand that everything be done to ensure that the associations and ngos , who have a crucial role to play in these cases , can continue their work and are not expelled .
here we see that there is a report from both the irish parliaments .
unfortunately , the lagendijk report does not explore such ways thus abandoning any realistic drive towards a better future .
the gulf cooperation council members have now become the economic powerhouse of the middle east and north africa region .
as the june list does not consider the eu merely to be a form of cooperation for the benefit of increased growth and trade , but also as a forum for upholding common fundamental human values , we have chosen to vote in favour of the report .
this is no small matter we are dealing with here , as the backbone of europe is the energy policy .
in a joint motion for a resolution with the group of the greens / european free alliance and the confederal group of the european united left - nordic green left , my group reiterates its unequivocal support for freedom of expression and plurality .
this ought to change .
we should have meetings more often , and that was also one of our joint conclusions .
but if the council were sincerely interested in the views of the european parliament it could have been here .
moreover , resulting from such controls and investigations and the communication of possible cases of fraud or irregularity to olaf , the honourable member may be aware that there are regulatory arrangements in place under regulation ( ec ) no 1681/94 , which provides that the member states shall report to the commission , at the appropriate stage , the details of their investigation into such possible cases of fraud or irregularity .
it should be borne in mind that , unfortunately , africa is a continent where there have been numerous cases of crime and genocide on a frequent basis .
it was an unrestrained attack on workers .
i welcome the issue of eurobonds .
this has not , however , resulted in an improvement in the ratio of women to men in the sciences .
russia did the same when it cut off the eu gas section .
now my last remark is very short . it is about the money .
where eu offensive interests , such as provincial government procurement , lie in areas of provincial competence , we have been assured that the provinces and territories of canada will be committed to the negotiations and to the implementation of the agreement .
- report : fava
i do not see the point of having air traffic structured mainly around just a few large airports .
i am therefore sad to hear that we have not yet reached that stage , and i am even sadder to learn that the reason for such a state of affairs is that this decision is being linked to another one that gives cause for concern : the lifting of the arms embargo on china .
jan mulder 's question as to why these radical proposals come so late was very good .
on the subject of the future of the eufor - althea military operation , we cannot extend it indefinitely .
recently , i met with the head of the customs authorities in ireland in dublin castle , and she told me that one in every five cigarettes - 20 % of the cigarettes smoked in ireland , a small country - actually comes via china , and that when they actually seized them and analysed them , they found a mixture of tobacco and canine excrement .
at this time of global instability , the european union is more important than ever for small member states like ireland .
it is very nice of us to say that state aid is not good , but the fact remains that china , korea , the united states and others give state aid .
i should remind you that international donors have withdrawn the financial support given to the island 's population .
without the euro , we would be in an extremely difficult situation , with the currencies of weaker countries facing enormous devaluation and the resulting deutschmark facing an impossible increase in value in order to sustain the german and european economies .
none of this promotes the realisation of market relationships .
nonetheless , the basic message is absolutely correct and the commission must adopt a much clearer approach here .
what is important is not the methods , it is the guarantee , in all honesty , that we are giving ourselves the means to achieve the objectives .
we were particularly concerned about this , because asylum procedures can take many years in some member states .
parliament has done a great job with this resolution , which i hope will be adopted here by a large , unanimous vote , for which we have worked extremely hard .
international labour standards should , above all , ensure workers ' rights , because work is a part of our daily lives and is critical for the dignity , welfare and development of a person .
coherence between the cap and eu external trade policy shall ensure the preservation of the european agricultural model , as well as a level playing field for eu producers in the world market .
i urge the house to reject the procedural motion and to allow the voting to take place in the order proposed by you on the voting lists .
essential prerequisites for this include free and just elections to the duma and the presidency , an easier process for registering political parties , which meets european standards , and a fair election campaign which gives all the candidates the same opportunities and access to the public media .
i should , of course , like to support the european anti - fraud office 's means for fraud detection in relation to china and asian countries , within the ethical code .
( pl ) madam president , in mr tarabella 's report on equality between women and men in the european union , several very important suggestions have been made to the european commission and the member states .
the same quantitative limits may also be applied by romania and bulgaria for swiss nationals during these same periods .
additional support for redundant workers is also proving necessary in a country that few would imagine would be affected by such hardships , as it is generally regarded as being more able to compete in the global market than most other eu member states .
we need to create an area of justice , freedom and security for all european union citizens .
today i saw on television sepp blatter and john fahey , the chairman of wada , discussing how anti - doping and football competitions could go hand in hand after the code of conduct has been adopted , and there is a problem .
iran , too , is a big exporter of terrorism - to iraq for example , it is a supporter of hezbollah and hamas .
that is why we organised the largest ever quantification , through which we wanted to determine what the actual costs arising from european legal acts and their implementation are for european businesses , insofar as relates to documentation , statistics , information and the like .
let me say at the outset that some member states are in , or near to , recession , and we must ask ourselves what is the most important thing we can do in those circumstances .
the political remoteness of the third pillar of the european union has made it possible for the governments to impose highly controversial restrictions on the fundamental rights of the citizens .
commissioner rehn has spoken in somewhat optimistic terms about the negotiations in cyprus .
that is precisely what has been missing so far or what has not been made sufficiently visible to our citizens .
how can this be prevented ?
on behalf of the ind / dem group . - mr president , the independence and democracy group has tried to be helpful , positive and constructive right through this parliamentary term .
these are two sectors which have massive potential in terms of industrial development , innovation , regional development and job creation , and which can increase europe 's energy security .
it will promote technological progress and , at the same time , it is the first of the supplementary measures being approved which is provided for in the framework of the revised strategy on emissions of carbon dioxide from cars .
( de ) madam president , i would like to make a few comments with regard to the european integration of serbia , if i may .
at this time , we are still getting used to the recast rules .
this is particularly the text concerning subcontracting .
it also lies in the potential of communication technologies and , of course , in a common or single vision of energy , as mr sosa wagner said , as this is central to the future of the european union 's existence .
how can we improve cooperation ?
the commission 's intervention measures have also succeeded in preventing milk prices from falling even further and the market seems to be relaxing .
at that conference , we will hear about the specific pledges made by the european union and its member states .
therefore , we should analyse our mistakes and not be so arrogant as simply to carry on as before .
i now think that this treaty , for all its weaknesses , still represents substantial progress .
if that aim is to be achieved , national provisions must be harmonised , in addition to repealing unnecessary provisions further to the two options proposed by the commission .
if it does , we , the swedish presidency , intend to have a first discussion among the member states on it , but it will be up to the spanish presidency to really start working on these issues .
this approach is in line with the july 2004 council conclusions on fisheries partnership agreements , on which parliament gave its opinion .
i will probably vote against both .
ways to promote more balanced competition conditions would be to facilitate the exemption from new state aid categories , to promote cooperation , to amend the directive on late payment in order to ensure payment within 30 days , and to remove obstacles to public procurement .
this happened , for example , when we introduced the accelerated withdrawal of single - hull oil tankers and our decision was then followed by a similar one on the part of the international maritime organisation .
the market is in fact demanding this of us .
i support this report which will also allow romania to access funds for facilitating the social inclusion of marginalised people , including roma , in both urban and rural areas .
other people have already said it about europe : no , do not doubt ; wake up , we are stronger .
our regulation proposes a plan to mitigate the environmental impact of the use of coal in order to offset the negative effects of the aid .
i am pleased , too , that in the committee on legal affairs we managed to negotiate chapter 5 on unfair contractual terms in a constructive form .
acquiring linguistic competence should be instrumental in improving one 's qualifications , finding a better job or acquiring new interpersonal contacts .
i think that if we were to link the day solely to the molotov - ribbentrop pact it would not do justice to everything that happened in the 20th century .
of course we need accountability , but it has reached a stage where there is now a disincentive for local groups to apply for funding .
i would like to ask two more specific questions .
a transparent economy that allows each person to express their talents is an innovative and sustainable economy .
this is primarily due to the fact that the rapporteur , by dint of consummate bargaining skill , great patience and dogged persistence , managed to negotiate and seal a compromise which the entire committee on legal affairs was ultimately able to endorse .
before introducing a new tax , the european commission must examine very carefully the pros and cons this tax will entail .
it is very democratic .
and yet the european community rolled out the red carpet for this man last december at the eu - african summit in lisbon .
firstly , this compromise very clearly asserts the freedoms of our citizens as laid down in the charter of fundamental rights , including the right of access to the internet , which is an integral part of freedom of expression and of information .
all these issues should be included in the cap after 2013 and should be taken into account when it is reformed .
referring to tradition , subsidiarity and the like in a situation when workers in the european union are subjected to unbridled exploitation is ridiculous and hypocritical .
the fact that the tunisian authorities prohibit the wearing of the hijab in public places indicates their determination to protect tunisia 's values of secularism , tolerance and liberty .
another important issue for the eu is immigration control .
i am deeply concerned that , whilst sporting events bring joy to millions worldwide , they are also ruthlessly being used as an opportunity to exploit women and girls .
but i take the point very well .
we must drive things forward to ensure that the world reaches the agreement required .
in the islands i hail from , it is the main industry .
while aspiring to be a global power and a global actor , we should change the balance between being a payer , as we are and we want to be , and being a key player in the world arena .
i now submit the 2008 budget for deliberation by the plenary session .
the commission therefore announced this year that it is to bring forward an ' innovation act ' .
( ro ) commissioner , thank you for the information you have provided .
the confederal group of the european united left - nordic green left voted against this report on speculative funds .
that is the way it happens , so mr dacian cioloş is fully included in these discussions .
under no circumstances should food additives endanger the health of consumers or mislead them , because it is absolutely essential that we guarantee consumer protection and food safety while at the same time maintaining the innovativeness and competitiveness of the food industry .
this is a very important decision that we are about to take .
i certainly welcome the repeal of the metrology directives and cutting red tape by 25 % .
we have voted in favour of amendments 5 , 8 , 11 , 12 and 13 , and regret that the european parliament did not go further in relation to accounting transparency , the fight against tax havens and environmental commitments ( ' new green deal ' ) .
i should like to say that the position of networks in the future structures of europe is very important and that these networks are far more important for a cohesive europe than the ever - growing bureaucracy both in brussels and in the member states .
at the same time it is important that the conditions applied in the field of regional policy should relate to fields which cohesion policy can influence , and member states should not be required to implement essential social and economic reforms in the name of conditionality .
businesses will not be able to pay it , member states ' budgets even less so .
however , i regret to say that the priority measures which will give new impetus to the single market and competitiveness do not include any mention of the need to ensure the free movement of all european workers , focusing only on the free movement of services .
in other words , the possibility for at least one million european citizens , both men and women , from the various member states , to be able to sign a legislative initiative .
in december 2006 the jha council was able to green light the start of the process with a schedule of operations worthy of a european version of the film ' mission impossible ' and with a minuscule budget , little more than half a million euros .
i take the point about the importance of stability : not only do we have to have it there , but we need to keep it there .
( for the results and other details on the vote : see minutes )
your visit is , as it were , the start of the celebrations and i should like to ask you now to address the european parliament .
next june , vice - president almunia will present to you the report on competition policy 2010 .
a strategic partnership is impossible to implement in full while these massive human rights violations are occurring , and so i would ask that we continue the dialogue but confront the chinese with what they are doing and not allow any hypocrisy .
we would therefore simply like to emphasise the urgent need for the member states to ratify it so that it can enter into force as soon as possible .
area of freedom , security and justice ( vote )
that being so , i wish to make it very clear that if the commission fails to deliver a substantive response on this issue within the stipulated time limit , i shall propose to the committee on legal affairs that we take proceedings against it in the european court for failure to act .
they ask whether the eu has nothing more pressing with which to concern itself than saving a couple of threatened orchids or animal species .
they reflect certain conflicts within the blocked doha development round .
we , as members of the european parliament , no longer accept the fact that you are not delivering . '
( nl ) mr president , there are extremists on all sides , but in recent years they have been dictating the tone and content of the political agenda .
public confidence in these systems is absolutely vital .
we were also able to invite some critics , although unfortunately they did not all come , because they do not want to subject their criticism to international scrutiny .
this is an indication of a very disturbing trend among opponents of abortion in europe who are using the aid programme to make their views public .
the figures are alarming .
one has nevertheless to recognise that some of them will face strong resistance , but the commission will certainly promote them .
in 2009 , the european union and japan accounted for approximately 20 % of the world economy and in 2010 , bilateral trade was worth eur 120 billion .
the issue of regulating working time and the freedom to work longer or shorter hours calls for a response that goes beyond a neo - marxist or ultraliberal ideology , in favour of a more pragmatic and realistic approach .
however , the council has always obstructed this .
rapporteur . - ( es ) madam president , allow me to say , first of all , that today a spanish fishing boat sank off the andalusian coast and as a result three people died and five are currently missing .
in any event , we hope that there will be a discussion in the council , and we urge that this issue be taken very seriously .
i shall , however , focus of course on parliament 's position .
already today , and most likely in the coming years , the member states will be under great pressure to ensure the supply of raw materials .
for this reason there must be a common approach to giving european citizens adequate protection from those risks .
given the specific organisation of sport , the dialogue must take account of the different levels of sport .
oral explanations of vote
so let us be glad that today we have managed to pick out the key points !
it is not true and it is not so .
i think we should prepare for post - war order .
it is therefore important to have a period of leave which would allow for the restoration of health , but which would also allow the mother to breastfeed her children for their health and development .
( nl ) mr president , i would like to ask my fellow member hartong the following question . at present , several eu member states are members of the g 8 , the organisation of the eight largest economies in the world .
of course , now we are discussing fuel prices .
for instance , council regulation ( ec ) no 1226/2009 fixing quotas for 2010 has provisions related to technical measures , namely article 7 on the prohibition of highgrading , and in annex iii on the restrictions on fishing for flounder and turbot .
i think that the recently passed directive or amended directive on company councils constitutes one of the eu 's major contributions in this matter .
i am very grateful to her .
contrary to what the european commission is asking , we oppose the idea of reallocating appropriations from the progress programme to the european microfinance facility , because that would send out a negative message to economic operators .
the third energy package forms the basis of this .
there was no conspiracy about it , or at least it was perhaps what h. g. wells called an open conspiracy , but at no stage have we had the courtesy to ask people whether they want to be citizens of a state with its own legal system .
after all , it has taken a very long time for the promises made so long ago to show the beginnings of the slightest effect .
if not , why not ?
the government guarantees have led to a variety of effects and distortions , such as a reduction in the spread of private loans , as well as an impact on the strategy followed by the pension funds .
i believe , however , that the negotiations concerning lifting the requirement for us visas provide a clear indication of the european union 's limitations .
in addition to other aspects , the text adopted by the ep not only contains contradictions but also completely ignores these central issues .
we are aware that some amendments , especially those that propose widening the scope of the regulation , will be subject to council discussion .
at a time when wealthy western countries are burning food , more than 850 million people are starving across the world .
in writing . - i would like to add my support to commissioner wallström 's point on ensuring that women are represented in the four senior posts in the eu .
if the aim is to impose the ' precautionary principle ' , then it should be applied to solar technology , too .
- before voting commenced :
what are we hearing ?
spain has developed measures which are being successfully applied , but much remains to be done .
the report to which the postponement relates obtained a 27 - vote majority in the committee on budgetary control , with 0 votes against and 0 abstentions , which means it was adopted unanimously .
however , in order for the process of reforms to be continued after 28 november , a clear signal from the european union is needed , so i am hoping that the forthcoming council summit will manage to push through the visa liberalisation process .
in terms of the sofia link with the eu network , a major step was taken with the signing of the contract for the construction of the road and rail bridge over the danube at vidin - calafat , financed by the ispa fund .
after these events , the credibility and transparency of the actions not only of the hungarian government , but also of the european commission , are at stake .
statement by the commission on latest developments in deployment of ccs technologies
i agree that the agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the european community and ukraine should be renewed for another five - year period .
south korea has not ratified any of the fundamental conventions of the international labour organisation .
that then leaves the possibility of acting on two fronts : rationalising of consumption and improving the efficiency ( particularly energy efficiency ) of what we produce .
the excessive administrative bureaucracy that is an obstacle to the majority of smes must be removed .
mr president , most people , when looking at this title , would say that cooperation seems a reasonable thing .
the commissioner was right .
it can cause enormous problems , for example , if you drive just a couple of kilometres further to reach a safe car park ( as all car parks are overflowing in europe ) or to reach a good car park for the night .
the second thing i would like to say is that , as a couple of members have already said , the cap is , of course , not ideal .
four characteristics come to mind .
i agree with the provisions of the regulation which give passengers appropriate guarantees should a journey be cancelled or delayed , even providing for additional compensation .
by adopting , tomorrow , the motion for a resolution on the european union 's strategy before the copenhagen summit , we meps must show that we are , firstly , totally determined , and that the summit must culminate in an agreement - one which is precise , certainly , but which is , above all , binding .
we have to name them ; we have to focus on how we can help those who suffer from both .
we must be able to exert pressure on the commission , but preferably not under such strict time pressure .
7 .
when granting aid we , the european union , should be generous so that the aid can be accepted with dignity .
under the new provisions in place since 2004 , this automatically triggered a review of the product 's benefit - risk balance , which led to the adoption of a commission decision requiring all member states to revoke any national authorisations for benfluorex containing medicinal products .
i find it very satisfying that soil degradation is recognised as a grave problem that must be overcome .
the davies report is very balanced and the compromise reached between the european parliament and the council fully meets the needs of the eu .
not only would it be a disgrace to the us human rights record to put him on death row , but it could be totally counterproductive in the fight against terrorism .
when it comes to more services in the political groups , we maintain that this would be of most benefit to the large groups - a development that would make it harder work for other groups to conduct their own policies .
the council and the commission should establish a follow - up mechanism .
our unachievable renewables targets , especially with regard to wind energy , actually threaten to cut off supplies of electricity .
then a man asked me this question : ' what does your husband say to that ? '
i therefore welcome the commission 's strategy to combat homophobia and would particularly like to thank commissioner reding for emphasising the importance of protecting these fundamental rights through her attendance here in plenary when the time is nearly midnight .
moreover , with regard to the guidelines adopted by the commission and the council , it is clear that there will be a repeat of what happened in 2007 and 2008 , namely , that spending will once again fall short of the limits laid down in the multi - annual financial framework , already insufficient to meet the needs of real social cohesion in the european union .
i would really like to a very generous position to be adopted in order to establish the european view of these problems even more clearly before the 2009 elections .
it is the aim of the iranian government to silence all opposition once and for all both inside and outside the country .
they are a logical continuation of the documents which we adopted last year .
he also called for a transparent and proper investigation of the events .
as regards socio - economic aspects , tuna fishing is a traditional activity and is the sole source of income for thousands of families : if it were to be shut down completely , fishermen would have to receive financial compensation from the eff .
the result we have obtained is significant and the approval for the amendment to the treaty , which was so widely supported by this house , contributed to this .
however , we must not allow ourselves to be dragged further into the libyan civil war or we risk becoming a target for terrorism and extremism .
mr president , i have some questions .
the maritime aspect of the issue is important , but not sufficiently so .
this objective states that at least 20 million people should be removed from the risk of poverty or exclusion by 2020 on the basis of three indicators put forward by the social protection committee , that is , the risk of poverty , material deprivation and living in a jobless household .
of course we will not know how effective and successful the eit will be until it has been established .
i believe that the legislation is particularly important for the countries which acceded most recently as they still lag behind in the area of separate waste collection .
this goal is important .
i encourage colleagues to sign written declaration 75 calling on parliament to meet in brussels and end strasbourg sessions .
we will carefully examine the proposals for a european space programme which the commission is to draw up , and we will then adopt a position on them .
he even said that he did not favour the veto .
in a couple of eu member states , you are born a donor , whereas in most countries , you can only donate by making an active personal decision to do so .
as a member of parliament representing a constituency very much affected by cross - border issues , and as someone who comes from the only region in france which shares a border with three other eu member states , i take a great interest in these issues and in projects for cross - border cooperation .
and we will want to ask mr musharraf this himself next week at a meeting of the international committee in brussels .
the figures it submitted were unclear and unreliable .
i therefore voted for this report .
very important decisions were taken , including decisions on the matter which prime minister ferenc gyurcsány of hungary recommended a year ago and which the rasmussen report of the european parliament supported , namely that a financial market and bank supervisory system be set up .
but then , everyone gets there sooner or later !
my original amendment to paragraph 87 aimed to confirm , rather than merely recognise , nato 's role as the bedrock for collective defence - a role which is not just ' still continuing ' but should be seen as the only option for the foreseeable future .
we need to make numerous changes in view of the smooth operation of the internal market .
when it comes to scaremongering politics about food that is not dangerous or unhealthy , i say ' that is enough ! '
the current economic and social crisis is having a very negative effect on the living conditions of men and women in the eu .
experts and specialists in the animal testing sector , the research community , the industry directly interested and citizens were involved in formulating the proposal with transparent procedures and without exclusions .
i think that having our deliberations in the open will also help people to make their own informed judgment of what is going on and of why we have so many important things on our agenda .
it must be said , however , that the instruments available to the european institutions and the very fact that they belong to the european union and have the opportunity to be part of economic and monetary union is a positive factor rather than an obstacle in terms of tackling a crisis such as the one that we are experiencing .
in our community , the advantage of each of the member countries is the effect of the prosperity of the whole . '
mr president , in my view , the arrest warrant is a fundamental tool in the fight against organised crime , terrorism and other forms of crime .
i am in favour of romania and bulgaria joining the schengen area .
this issue is addressed in some detail in a study that was commissioned by the committee on constitutional affairs ( afco ) and i believe that the study itself clearly demonstrates that a range of complicated constitutional , political and practical issues are at stake with regard to establishing such a statute .
i will take this opportunity - and i apologise , mr president , you can deduct this time from my two minutes later - i will take this opportunity to condemn the political pressure , slanderous campaigns and accusations of anti - semitism that have been levelled at members who are simply standing up for peace and justice .
i believe the disputed points will be resolved swiftly and perhaps even easily , given the importance of this topic .
i would say that , for us , the primary factor is the safety to human and animal health and the environment as well .
the problems we are facing in relation to the future are actually internal political problems within the council and between member states with different attitudes towards the eu and its budget in the future .
one needs to mention here the increasingly complicated nature of geopolitics .
however , the commission considers that 10 other water bodies should have been designated as sensitive areas .
about 90 % of all large ships decommissioned around the world in 2007 were dismantled on the coasts of south asia , mainly in india and bangladesh .
i think that everything indicates that this is quite the wrong signal to send , as uzbekistan has not really listened to the demands of the international community .
on behalf of the ind / dem group . - ( da ) mr president , all legislative bodies must be subject to scrutiny at all times and must also be prepared , as we are , to carry out self - monitoring .
christians in cyprus are in danger .
how can it be solved ?
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , let us recall that free movement has been one of the fundamental pillars of the single european market , which aims to achieve increased competition and larger economies of scale and confers on the eu its main power of attraction .
the subject of market access is a salient issue for both camps .
the report addresses the importance of innovation in all its forms to the development of societies .
that is why the legal act on the harmonious regulation of coastal tourism is necessary .
however , i trust that he recognises the mandate which he has been given by meps , and accordingly entertains their views as governor of the ecb .
we want to see support for organic production methods , and it is our wish - we have tabled an amendment to this effect - that regions should be able to decide by a majority vote that their wines can be traded in bottles only .
it is a country where millions of people suffer from hunger , even during years where there is a rich harvest .
i voted in favour of the proposal for a directive for the following reasons : 1 .
finally , with regard to the matter criticised by several members of the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament , namely the internal market test , without dramatising this matter , i would remind you , ladies and gentlemen , that any legislative proposal must respect the treaty .
as regards transparency , there is a decision by the court of justice .
however , this is just off the top of my head .
trade agreements do not impose privatisation or deregulation obligations , and it will be no different for this ceta , which will include provisions on sustainable development covering economic , environmental and social aspects .
so there will be , of course , competences that she will be able to develop inside the commission , as vice - president of the commission , but working also hand - in - hand with the member states and with the council .
the concern expressed in amendments 11 and 12 about events in lhasa also merit observation .
the european union will be able to use the experience gained during the shutdown processes with nuclear power plants that are approaching the end of their economic lives .
mr lópez garrido , mrs malmström , in my opinion , any agreement will only be acceptable if guarantees of a suitable level of data protection are given , respecting the principles of necessity and proportionality and the eu rules in force .
i call again on the european authorities to redouble their efforts so that she is freed and that she can gain asylum or freedom in her own country , and to ensure that the state - sponsored murder of women and other human rights violations are ended in iran .
they are also one of the principal drivers of european growth , since they create new jobs and stimulate innovation .
we give preference to , or promote , specificity under certain rules .
the declared objective is to come down on ' terrorist propaganda ' on the internet .
furthermore , as has been pointed out here , it is the final statement from the eu - brazil summit itself which explicitly and completely unequivocally states that the european union and brazil will work together so that the eu - mercosur association agreement might finally become a reality .
third , we need to get the analysis right .
i welcome president obama 's attendance in copenhagen with a mandate including clear targets for reducing emissions , which the us is going to commit to .
hence , we must all work towards ensuring respect for different religious beliefs , and i believe that this text is in keeping with that approach .
given a change in the substantive legal basis and in view of the forthcoming european elections , a considerable length of time might no doubt have elapsed before the appropriate legislation could be enacted .
to the banks , i say : we cannot give weight to your protestations while your aggregates are cloaked in secrecy and you stamp ' confidential ' on everything .
for the non - euro area new member states , the leeway for using the budget stimulus out of their own resources is much reduced because of this financial crisis , and the credit crunch is likely to prevail on the international markets in 2009 .
it is easy for us in the european parliament or in the european commission to say that we need a large economic recovery package , we must pump large amounts of money into the economy , because it will not be our money , we do not have any money .
in writing . - the ferreira report deals with the amendment of council regulation no 708/2007 , which established a framework governing aquaculture practices in relation to alien and locally absent species .
but those good years have come to an end .
now it is important for us to do full justice to all the issues relating to the treaty of lisbon , including the entire budget area .
ireland is a democratic state .
there are two esdp missions supporting reform of the congolese police and army , whose unpreparedness and lack of efficiency were , as we have seen in this case , only too tragic .
we do have a plan , a plan of creating a european space based on justice , freedom and security .
the same applies to advertising bans .
however , we have today established a good basis for cross - border cooperation in criminal matters .
it also means that , if they were professional , well educated and knew where they were going , we would not have to be afraid of overcharging .
of course , with consumer law , it is very difficult .
oral explanations of vote
my colleagues from the united nations , the african union and other organisations have talked about this already .
contrary to some concerns , differentiating between food and non - alcoholic beverages , on the one hand , and alcoholic beverages , on the other hand , does not create a serious administrative burden for businesses .
you ignore the social question - which , you say , should remain the sole responsibility of member states - but you say nothing about the european court of justice , which delivers ruling upon ruling placing the different social models within the union in competition with each other and basing itself on articles 43 and 49 of the treaty .
several of you highlighted the importance of focusing on appropriate implementation , so that our programmes and proposals would not simply stay on paper .
to conclude in english : earlier this year , commissioner quinn stated that ' we need to send red tape to the shredder .
on the basis of the basel ii report , the european parliament has finally won rights of scrutiny that should actually be normal in a democracy , against huge opposition from the council and opposition from the commission .
i would like to thank the european parliament for this discussion on the very important topic of environmental inspections .
nevertheless , it is the balance of the package as a whole which is at stake and on which we shall be voting during a future plenary session .
for many years now , international communities , ngos and congolese women have made constant efforts to combat the use of sexual assault as a weapon of war .
the european union 's sanctions reflect our dissatisfaction with the slow rate of progress towards democracy , the persistent detention of numerous political prisoners and the violation of fundamental freedoms .
however , parliament 's report leads me to conclude that this house has reached the point of accepting a total ban on seal fur skins .
i definitely have nothing against making the climate into a separate responsibility .
i am ready to look at it and see what the commission can do to help .
firstly , does the commission check that the individual member states really do apply the same criteria and carry out measurements with equal stringency , or are there differences here ?
the 2008 elections re - established democracy and civilian rule .
for the member states the issue is slightly more complicated , because the directive cannot work well until the electronic social welfare and healthcare systems in the member states of the union are compatible .
in this regard , the eu also needs to take a look at its own behaviour - for example , in the case of the illegal cia overflights .
christian writers and academics are having to go into hiding .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( de ) madam president , mr president - in - office , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by thanking mrs oomen - ruijten for the very fruitful and constructive cooperation .
i would like us for once to talk a bit more honestly about this and then to make somewhat fewer decisions , but perhaps ones that will really bring about progress .
we urgently need to be able to safeguard decent work for the citizens of europe .
fourthly , i suggest that the commissioner needs to be more proactive in fighting for speedier approval of gm substitutes .
let me tell you that this same concern was voiced by all the member states which took the floor at the last agriculture and fisheries council .
in writing . - i am pleased to support the peace programme and hope it will continue to help communities at a grass - root level .
the commission is firmly committed to working towards a fair , efficient and protection - oriented common european asylum system .
as upton sinclair once observed , it is very difficult to make a man see something when his job depends upon not seeing it .
we are going to see , to observe , to analyse and to count what is happening between today and 8 march next year , and if nothing changes , then i am prepared to take action at eu level to redress the gender balance in corporate board rooms .
this is something else i have not grasped and i believe it is important to understand this aspect of the legal basis .
at european union level , however , it is very important that double standards not be applied .
yet there is also a great deal of work still to be done closer to home , and indeed even in our group , particularly with the support of our chair , mr daul .
3 .
we still need to steer these proposals through council and parliament and i would repeat that we need your full support in order to get these proposals through as rapidly as possible , especially in those parts which would require legislative amendment .
the fact of the matter is that these decisions should be taken at member state level .
the aviation sector is expanding .
also , at union level , we have developed instruments and community financial schemes to take into account the characteristics of the space sector with respect , in particular , to forthcoming financial perspectives .
on this occasion , the authors of the regulation agree as never before with the scientific , technical and economic committee for fisheries that there is still a lack of sufficiently reliable information to be passed to fishermen in the form of comprehensible opinions on the tac .
i would like to state that a directive , no matter how comprehensive and specific it is , cannot replace the need for the eu 's defence industry and , more generally , its security industry to have a clear vision .
terrorism is an attempt to attain one 's ends through blind violence and to destroy our common values .
in other words , the commission 's reform efforts , whose aims were linked to assurances concerning responsibility , accountability , efficiency , a new european service culture and transparency , have proved a spectacular failure .
my thanks also to the chairman of the committee on agriculture and rural development , neil parish , who has been very helpful and supportive .
in other words , it lays down definite time periods , incentives and , most of all , no exceptions .
this will involve a lot of time pressure and a lot of stress , but also great challenges and great opportunities to make a difference .
among these new perspectives , we should expect a new way of thinking and a new approach on the part of the member states since , for the first time , the treaty of lisbon names them as being co - responsible for the implementation of the eu budget .
furthermore , financial tensions are beginning to have repercussions on the financing of economic institutions .
madam president , i have major concerns for the dairy industry in the uk.
looking back , much more could have been done , and earlier .
we all acknowledge that the eu is strongly dependent on imported fishery and aquaculture products to satisfy its market demands , represented not only by consumers , but also by the processing industry .
our christian culture and our conception of mankind and of history give us cause to hope that all the violations committed will be punished in a firm and balanced way .
up until now , we have always overlooked it , which was a great injustice .
moreover , i would say that this green paper is very important and must enable us to ask many questions , and to move ideas forward .
one commentator says that in reality , the turnover relating to counterfeiting is approximately eur 500 billion .

on behalf of the pse group . - madam president , on behalf of the pse group i would like to thank markus ferber for his report and his hard work over many years .
in the resolution by the european parliament , we also welcome the accession request filed by this country , but emphasise that other steps still need to be taken .
one : more checks on illegal imports .
the banking sector is asking for more collateral and higher risk premiums , both requirements resulting in insufficient financing and missed business and employment opportunities in this particularly large sector of the economy .
in practice , the head of security services has no involvement in the appointment of judges to the constitutional court .
this has been made possible by the fact that the maldives are seriously threatened by climate change and because ' climate change and development ' is the main theme of the edd .
it remains open for any of the four remaining member states to join later on .
to end the recession , we need to plan the required funding at european level , and the idea of own resources should be put into practice .
as smaller businesses have had all the obligations of the services directive thrust upon them anyway , it would be good to know how they , in particular , have benefited from the directive .
milk quotas allocated to individual countries are not being fully taken up .
i personally have no comments to make on any lack of transparency .
however , the position he adopts as rapporteur gives member states a licence to impose very high charges , up to a few euros per kilometre , with the congestion charge and the mark - up on top .
in fact , boosting an economy without first having restored community preference at our borders is like trying to warm a house when all the windows have to be left open .
there were one million divorces granted in the eu during 2007 , 13 % of which involved couples consisting of partners of different nationalities .
we also share a vision of the so - called ' traditional ' policies - namely , the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy .
if we are to succeed in this , it is not enough for the developed world to reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases by 20 % .
the one - stop cooperation aviation security is not about transfer of personal data and it does not concern information processing with respect to the pursuit of suspected criminals or terrorists , so as such , we will not raise it in the pnr negotiations .
in recent years , we have done a lot of work to reduce the distance travelled between farmer and consumer , and today , factors such as life on the farm , farmers ' markets , and so on are very important overall for the image of farmers and agriculture .
public services across europe are asking us to clarify the legal situation concerning on - call time .
that is why the programme is being adapted , to enable two - way mobility , not only into but also out of the eu member states , which in my view is a very important qualitative change which will bring results .
both irresponsible exploitation of resources and ill - considered transport flows can have serious ecological consequences .
i cannot support this .
lastly , we cannot ignore the impact on the developing world of insecurity , particularly with the grain market , where countries that cannot afford to pay more for food are seeing a massive increase in their food bill .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , during the last parliamentary term our radical party colleague , maurizio turco , asked the european commission some questions about the tax privileges of the catholic church and companies revolving around it in italy and spain .
one of the aims of the european union 's cohesion policy should be to bolster the instruments of solidarity and integration .
russia is the eu 's third - largest trading partner , as well as having major strategic importance in terms of europe 's energy supply .
unfortunately , she will have to emigrate to another country .
the existence and resistance of the euro and also the precise action of the european central bank have prevented the situation escalating .
while i agree that no one should force women to wear such clothing , i am concerned that a ban might result in an outcome the exact opposite of that intended : women who are prepared to wear the burkha going to prison .
i hope that the application of this standard dispute settlement mechanism will increase the security and the predictability of trade relations between the eu and the kingdom of morocco .
there are certainly still a number of problems : finding funding partners in the private sector ; avoiding , as far as possible , different rates of digitisation between member states ; solving certain technical aspects relating to the coordination of access to digitised works ; preserving digitised content ; resolving the issue of the integrated search engine for meta - information in image documents and for direct searching of text documents ; finding content interoperability solutions , and enabling multilingual searching by subject or keyword in addition to the current situation of searching by author or title .
i believe that we must create the right conditions for cooperation between the member states ' national authorities , which would facilitate the application of administrative or legal measures across borders .
in romania the communist regime was imposed with the help of russian troops , at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives lost in labour camps and prisons .
europe 's message to consumers over all these years has been : choose energy label α .
all of the parties involved , and the international community as a whole , can learn from this report .
moreover , consumers will receive a guarantee that named fibres meet specific characteristics , and will also benefit from the fact that new fibres will reach the market earlier .
therefore , my questions to you , commissioner , are : what will the commission do to make sure that this fund will finance or give credit to quality projects ?
he deserves our support in tomorrow 's votes .
we must be aware that the high quality standards imposed on livestock farmers come at a cost .
we can see that the legislation in force in egypt similarly guarantees religious freedom , but in practice , the experience of christians is that the opposite is the case .
i know , mr billström , that this programme is close to your heart .
the current threshold is arbitrary and does not take into account the competitive growth of the sector .
it was a fierce battle that we won here , particularly against the council .
it was at this point that i asked to speak to the president in private .
we now no longer have any competitive edge with galileo , so marketing the system is clearly becoming more difficult .
community provisions on the supply of cross - border services should therefore be rationalised , and a minimum period for the harmonisation of quality standards introduced , so as to protect users ' interests .
i am definitely against this interpretation of article 19 , which ranks procedural matters above principles and rights , particularly freedom of speech .
unfortunately , the liberals and the socialists in this house were not ready to fight with the greens to make this recovery package a real first step to a green new deal .
the report that we have voted on today in parliament expresses a preference for sustainable health services financed either from public funds or from international solidarity .
pnr data are already available now , today , without an eu pnr scheme , simply with a warrant and due cause .
in order to be able to pay out this money quickly , i simply need the legal basis in article 186 .
children imitate the games which can lead to tragic results .
what is perhaps even more remarkable , however , is the fact that , in preparation for this ministerial conference , a growing number of states and international organisations , such as the african union , have decided to step up their efforts to promote resolution 1325 , notably through the development of national action plans .
this was the view cynically expressed by the man who will remain in history the creator of the cruellest , long - standing dictatorship in the world .
in writing . - i voted against the costa report on airport slots , in order to highlight the complete lack of consultation with airport authorities , the lack of debate with meps and the rushed nature of the legislation .
the commission has also been in close contact with vietnam on this issue in order to provide all necessary assistance and expertise .
what is needed is absolutely clear , and that is solidarity with people fleeing from insufferable living conditions .
i am therefore delighted by the adoption today of the working time directive , which can provide a response to these social changes .
the european union must invest , as a priority , in creating and preserving jobs in education , health care , agriculture and transport and energy infrastructures .
i would like to thank everyone concerned once again .
the efforts made so far have not produced any tangible results .
the german conservative group ( cdu / csu ) is therefore speaking out in favour of a social europe .
therefore , i regret that those on the left and the liberal left in the european parliament often join together to keep silent about the fate of christians .
to achieve this objective it is necessary to implement multi - level governance , regional planning and the partnership principle .
i would like to add one thing to what has already been said .
the work on climate - smart , resource - efficient processes and products , green energy and green jobs must be stepped up .
on one point i believe that the commission could require clearer and more consistent behaviour from minsk : i refer to the situation of the tens of thousands of children who stay with european families for a few months .
i would remind colleagues who have not been able to take the floor that they may enter a written statement , which will enable them to put their explanation of vote on the record .
specialist workers and those who have retrained for another career can meet the market 's specific needs much more easily , thanks to their high level of mobility .

on the political situation in burma / myanmar , the government seems committed to proceed with its so - called ' road map to democracy ' .
i hope i have your support for that .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on regional development . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as draftsman of the opinion , i would particularly like to say something about the amendments to the egaf , the european globalisation adjustment fund , and express my appreciation for the commission 's proposal over the agreement reached with parliament at first reading .
in writing . - ( pt ) despite successes at an official political level , kyrgyzstan remains steeped in instability and conflict , and there is no sign that the situation will soon become stable .
georgia is currently a country where the european union 's reputation as a major force on the international scene is being decided .
the commission agreed to undertake to negotiate a framework agreement with parliament , in which , firstly , it agreed to justify and increase the powers of the parliament with respect to legislative initiative ; secondly , it accepted the principle of complete freedom of access to information whether with respect to legislative and political action or in relation to international negotiations ; and , finally , it agreed to take into account parliament 's opinion regarding the commissioners and the reshuffling of the commissioners .
( el ) mr president , the council 's common position on the organisation of working time is an anti - labour monstrosity and has rightly whipped up a hurricane of protest by workers in the member states .
the eu cohesion policy , through the european social fund , will continue to cofinance initiatives at national and local level .
in addition to this , we emphasise the need for a binding character of this second annex and point out that we will amend the mandate of frontex according to these principles .
in today 's situation this is an incomprehensible anachronism .
for its part , belarus needs to permit entry to european delegations , too , to enable debates with opposition members .
( hu ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am pleased that the topic of inter - country adoption and of abandoned children was included in the european parliament 's agenda .

on behalf of the alde group . - madam president , i wish to begin by making a general remark .
we say yes to a large budget , and no to cuts to the common agricultural policy .
rapporteur . - ( fr ) mr president , i just wanted to ask mr tannock if the addition he is proposing is in fact an addition , or whether his aim is to remove the section on violence and ill - treatment in police custody and penitentiary institutions .
one example of this is pre - accession aid , which , as we all know , is awarded to potential candidate countries , but which it only makes sense to pay if the states in question are getting to grips with their corruption problems or if the necessary structures are actually established .
let us therefore fight for better structural reforms and work towards more incisive employment policies , so as to encourage the weaker sections of society to join the labour market .
as has been pointed out , the usa has had legislation in place since 2001 .
in order to adapt to the effects of climate change , we need a funding mechanism , providing exact figures for the sums which need to be invested in green technologies which create new jobs , something which is so necessary during this crisis period .

a little later i met a retired lady , lucia annone .
after the november elections , the political parties should be able to change the gender ratio and they should designate at least 18 women in the european parliament .

18 .
i believe in a europe that is open and generous , a europe that is particularly dedicated to the millennium development goals .
we are very keen to see the report of the osce / odihr monitoring mission .
madam president , it was good to see the commissioner in ljubljana at the opening of acer .
i looked around very carefully , and there was no contribution to be heard at all , either to justify or to support the motion , and so the house agreed that it was not necessary for anyone to speak against it if it was not justified .
in the first place , it is unacceptable because it is aligned with neo - liberal policies that exacerbate the current economic and social crisis , especially in agriculture and fishing , but this fact becomes particularly serious when these policies are promoted through an agreement with a country that is violating international law and the most basic rights of the palestinian people ; a country which does not respect its obligations as agreed in the roadmap for peace , keeping gaza under siege , building more settlements , continuing to build the wall and expelling palestinians from jerusalem .
now the situation is under control , thanks to the egyptian authorities .
statement by the president
as we know and have said , the result is the opposite .
i want rights enshrined in law which cannot be taken away - not gifts , but rights .

we need to be able to cut the current costs of bureaucracy and action , although i am disappointed to say that the report by the committee on the environment , public health and food safety fails to do that .
it is the only option that i can see in this case .
mr president , i was pleased to vote in favour of the commission today because i think , in the circumstances and under the rules of the house , it was the right thing to do .
6 .
the report refers to a range of problems whose solution is particularly important to individual countries .
president sarkozy , are you willing to allow a question from mr schulz ?
it has become part of the brussels racket , this massive mechanism for taking money from the taxpayer and distributing it to those fortunate enough to be employed within the system .
if that happens , a 4 % contribution to economic growth over the coming decades might not be unrealistic .
this situation increases the danger of conflicts of interest and , by extension , of a lack of transparency and quality in terms of awarding ratings to the various financial instruments .
the vote will take place tomorrow ( tuesday , 9 march 2010 ) .
this is a major political challenge for a europe that must assert itself as a visible leader in this process .
how does the council assess the current human rights situation in cuba , in particular with regard to political detainees ?
europe must help this come about .
making it clear that this is a purely defensive system is the subject of american - polish - czech - russian negotiations .
keeping to the speaking time , too , is a matter of fairness .
demanding budgetary increases in this difficult situation is scandalous .
please believe us when we say that this is very important for us .
as a result , immigration should surely not be treated primarily as a police phenomenon , let alone as a likely source of terrorism , as it has ended up being discussed in europe .
in writing . - ( fr ) i should like to make two comments on the gill report , which is essentially about organising research programmes with a view to making older people more independent through the use of information and communication technologies .

taking a soft line with the turkish authorities vis - à - vis their responsibilities is a strategic error that distances them from the progress to be made , not towards accession to the eu , but to allow the turkish people to reap the benefits of their basic rights and social and economic development in turkey .
the lisbon treaty creates better conditions for more open , effective and dynamic european integration .
thirdly , mr president , i feel that we need to distinguish between what the european union needs to do in the medium term and what it needs to do in the short term .
moreover , member states are obliged to respect the principle of solidarity in this area .
deferring the votes is not serious from the legal point of view of our obligations to the council .
i would like to know the commissioner 's view on paragraph 22 ; in other words , the risk that withdrawal of trade preferences will make it harder for countries to get away from situations such as poor working conditions .
economic partnership agreements should promote trade between the eu and papua new guinea and fiji and contribute to trade , development , sustainable growth and the reduction of poverty .
i do not know if some of you understood me correctly : i stated clearly that , in the course of 2010 , we hope to make proposals for bosnia and herzegovina and for albania .
the sole purpose of draft amending budget no 9/2010 is to formally enter the budgetary adjustment arising from the mobilisation of the european union solidarity fund into the 2010 budget .

looking at the situation in belgium , the court of auditors , too , says that a large proportion of the funds spent in wallonia - hainaut , in particular - was misspent .
we have had a long discussion about foodstuffs and i think that we have arrived at a sensible solution .

moreover , we issue a warning to hamas .
how many votes did the commissioners get and where did they get them ?
we need to see a strong and sustainable cap - based on two pillars - which will keep farmers on the land , ensure environmental protection , promote the rural economy and provide fairness and transparency for all those who work in the food chain .
the first is that we continue to take an inconsistent line in dealing with the economic crisis and the difficulties of the euro .
that is what is at stake .

in writing . - ( ro ) the recent attacks in the basque country show once again that terrorism is a daily reality and that we need effective instruments to fight it .

we must also ensure that we guarantee some kind of clarity in terms of financing .
this - as mr jonckheer said - is an abnegation of our powers as co - legislator ; this means - and i say this with all due respect for the work that has been done over three years of negotiations - that we find ourselves at the point of not exercising our power to improve the directive .
adoption of this resolution cannot fail to prompt a couple of comments on its aims and content .
i am really grateful for the support you have given me , but the epp was the first to say that they do not want this because it is alone .
a step - by - step approach is essential .
in 2008 , three times as many arrived , about 31 000 .
that is why we have championed , for example , greater clarification of the actions between the institutional and cooperative frameworks involved in the recently defined eastern dimension .
it will do much to restore the moral authority and the political credibility of the uk and it should assist the irish to find a new consensus based on less libertas and more veritas .
many thanks for that .
as far as we are concerned , fisheries agreements are not merely agreements in which we are allowed to utilise a resource and pay for it , and when we utilise less we pay less .

it is also the branch of industry that has made it possible for generation after generation to live on the island .
have there been any positive changes i this respect ?
however , as mr daul elegantly put it , it was the right that won the elections , therefore you are on the right .
of course , i welcome the fact that the question of arms cooperation indicates that collaboration with the european defence agency is possible , with the cyberspace issue , in particular , being of great significance for the agency .
however , europe is also under an obligation to take steps which will , in future , protect all christians throughout the world and not allow similar tragedies to occur again .
although the report acknowledges this need and suggests some important measures that we consider positive , it nonetheless opens the door to solutions that we view with concern and cannot accept , such as lifting the zero tolerance for the presence in imported feed of gmos , which puts the strict application of the precautionary principle at risk .
the rapporteur calls for support , especially for smes , to enable the relatively high level of female employment to be retained , particularly in the case of women who find themselves in an unfortunate professional situation .
the european union has been a player on the global market for very many years , with an economy based , in particular , on knowledge and innovation .
i will read it out in english :
how can austrian citizens , for example , identify with an eu which has resulted in them being overcome by an avalanche of transit traffic , punished them with sanctions for holding democratic elections and forced them to give up their neutrality and banking secrecy ?
in the name of democracy , the result of a democratic election is being booed off the platform and brushed aside .

however , mr president , the latest scanners are additional security tools .
the european union 's power and success hitherto stem from two key ideas of europe 's founding fathers : the first being respect for human dignity and the second cooperation .

i condemn china 's support for the sudanese regime .
therefore , we must prepare for an in - depth discussion on whether the policies of the past few years have delivered a response to consumers and producers , or whether conversely they have created problems for both .
we have resolved all of this .
recourse to sanctions may also be justified in cases of irreversible environmental damage to the natural environment when this becomes a threat to security and thus a serious infringement of human rights .
i believe that we should be prepared to show solidarity with other countries in europe .
thank you for working together fairly and thank you also to the slovenian presidency of the council because , in the entire two and a half years , it was the only presidency that really brought any momentum into the debate .

finally , i would like to say a few words about our future action on immigration .
the socialist and democrat group is clear that this interim agreement should apply only for 12 months and that a new agreement should be negotiated with parliament as co - legislator so that we in this house can ensure that delicate balance of protecting the fundamental rights of european citizens in the important and critical fight against terrorism .
my question was on exactly the same wavelength .
distortions caused by value added tax ( vat ) fraud affect the overall balance of the own resource system , which must be fair and transparent in order to guarantee the smooth operation of the union .
when the eu does impose sanctions they should be precise and well targeted .
therefore , i ask , at least in this case , that we do not contribute to the further burdening of the legal and economic environment in the european union .
so we need to build up small and medium - sized enterprises in african countries and in india , which will then develop business models .
in writing . - ( pt ) the proposal voted on by parliament is already a compromise , albeit unsatisfactory , on the commission 's original proposal and does not take account of the problems of countries in economic difficulty , particularly the outermost regions .
lastly , it should be stated that food labelling can never be a manual for good diet .
these people are also excluded from its scope .
it is thus with pleasure and a strong spirit of supportiveness that i speak today in the chamber in favour of the report by mr salafranca sánchez - neyra .
important areas such as tourism and industry were severely damaged .
the next item is the vote .

i call on the european commission to consider amending the relevant provisions for the benefit of all member states of the union , and in particular for the benefit of the poorest families bringing up children .
most of what had been achieved has been lost following lobbying by the agrochemical industry and the less efficient among the public regulatory authorities .
so that in itself is a very positive element .
we talk about climate change .
europe is now heading the change .

in the wake of the economic crisis we can see ideas of increased protectionism .

i would like to ask the 34 delegations of the european parliament to enhance their promotion of european values on other continents in the european year of intercultural dialogue , and to facilitate the knowledge of other cultures and traditions .
however , it has now become clear that the eu does not have suitable instruments available to deal with this crisis .
the joint culpability of the majority society is also often glossed over .
i believe it would be in their interest to do so .
mr president , eu enlargement is , at the moment , far less of a priority than in the years leading up to the major enlargement waves of 2004 and 2007 .
financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
the crisis in the graphics sector in the netherlands has affected a number of the country 's regions , including noord holland and utrecht .
financial assistance given to workers affected by redundancies as a result of globalisation must be carried out on a case - by - case basis and have their reintegration into the labour market as its goal .
do this in the name of democracy and freedom .
the inspectors said it must be over there in a particular spot where the system had shown it to be .

it will replace certain provisions contained in the 12 bilateral agreements on air services between the member states and the federative republic of brazil this agreement provides the foundation for strengthening relations between the eu and brazil in the aviation sector , and is expected to bring significant benefits for consumers in terms of lower fares by up to eur 460 million , as well as new business opportunities for eu airlines .
these are partner states that commit to focusing their policies , and consequently their spending , on the mdg .
on 4 december , russian public prosecutors organised a raid on the offices of the memorial organisation , during which a database containing the details of thousands of victims of stalin 's regime was seized .
i fully support the key points made by mrs gomes in the report , i.e. the need for libya to introduce a moratorium on the use of the death penalty , to ratify the geneva convention on refugees , to actively fight trafficking of human beings , to guarantee fair agreements for illegal migrants and to adopt modern asylum laws .
look at other countries where this also happened in the past : now they have much more interest in intellectual property rights .
this is a very important step in this process and we now look forward to the commission proposals in the near future .
commercial relations between the european union and canada can go well beyond the commitments undertaken through the world trade organisation as long as they are based on a balanced agreement , a guarantee of proper reciprocal access to each other 's markets and improved protection for trademarks , patents and geographical indications .
the agreements reached are largely a reflection of voluntary agreements in the sector and that is something i warmly welcome .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , many goals have been reached but some battles have not yet even begun .
this increase comes at the cost of the common agricultural policy ( cap ) , thus at the cost of french agriculture which , until recent years , was the main beneficiary of the cap.
( es ) - mr president , following consultation with the political groups signing the joint resolution , we wish to request a change in the structure of paragraph 3 .
i would therefore like to ask whether the council can tell us what this stream of refugees will mean in terms of what proportion can be included in the resettlement programme .
we have done so in the past , and we should carry on doing it .
then , to crown it all , there is paragraph 26 , in which you propose following the advice of george soros !
written statements ( rule 149 )
they decided to act for the benefit of their friends in the banks and not for that of the plain people of ireland .
it will offer the eu the opportunity to act in line with its ambitions , underpinning the lisbon treaty 's cfsp provisions - to be not only a payer in conflict situations , but also a player .
the european parliament 's proposal for investment , based on an agreement reached with the council , is built on three pillars , namely : interconnection of gas and electricity networks ; carbon capture and storage ; and offshore wind projects .
most of the children were sentenced for murder , but many sentences seem to be based on unreliable confessions , obtained by torture and during interrogations at which the detained were denied the right of access to a lawyer .
some people lay the blame at mr trichet 's door , others blame mr juncker .
after declaring independence , it maintained good relations with its nearest neighbours , including the republic of serbia , with which it had previously been joined in a federation .
mr president , mr oettinger , you already know that i do not trust your stress tests .
in my opinion , this is not the best way of handling the situation , as violence only begets more violence .
he will now be given the floor again and mr borloo and mr le maire will remain with us .
the rapporteur , mr rasmussen , has taken the initiative and had the vision to propose that hedge funds and private equities , which hold assets amounting to over 4.5 % of world gdp , are not free of responsibility towards society and must be subject to intelligent regulation and supervision .
i would therefore call on you not to make use of the eu institutions to solve problems which should , under our treaties , be solved at national level .
by trying to simplify and clarify that , hopefully we can also reduce the amount of fraud currently in the system .
some of these regulations are completely absurd and , in some cases , do not even permit smoking in the open air .
the uyghurs are supported , in particular , by the world uyghur congress based in munich , and the cultural heritage of kashgar is supported by the blue shield movement , the president of which , karl von habsburg , was here in strasbourg this week to provide us with information .
this would require , first of all , stopping harmful subsidies like the eur 6 billion yearly in europe for fossil fuels and more stringent , ets legislative support , resource efficiency and energy efficiency and tools such as a more stringent eco - design directive .
access to health care is a right of all eu citizens and providing equal access for all to high - quality medical services is a core task of the member states ' public authorities .
i can only tell you that all the eu institutions are committed to gender mainstreaming .
the work carried out by president barroso over the last five years was characterised by great pragmatism , seriousness and firmness in the way he looked after europe 's top interests .
this leads me to draw attention to the considerable misgivings of certain sectors of public opinion , as this accession has come at the wrong time .
it is a strong instrument which will provide a safer haven for victims of violence across member states ' borders .
we need to do this for the further reason that we need to respond to peoples ' aspirations in europe and , whatever nicolas sarkozy may think , social europe is a very real issue that you will have to address if you want to avoid being disowned by europe 's citizens in the very near future .
it will allow increased competition , greater choice for the travelling public .
( et ) mr president , inherent in the concept of europe working together is the idea that , in principle , the euro area can only go in two directions : it can either become stronger or disintegrate .
president of the commission . - as you said , mr karas , there is no decision yet .
action taken on parliament 's positions and resolutions : see minutes
or could it have to do with the oil reserves in the region around kirkuk and turkey 's intention of removing the autonomous status of the kurds in northern iraq ?
3 .
we did this in the past and we can do it again in the future .
it is no good calling on the americans to close the place , which the new president is doing , if we cannot shoulder some responsibility .
the need for this type of aid is not diminishing ; on the contrary , natural disasters are growing in number and scope .
the next item is the report by guy bono , on behalf of the committee on culture and education , on cultural industries in europe .
if reforms are made there and if people get down to working on a respectable legal system and on combating bureaucracy , then a european future is realistic , but if that does not happen , then it is not .
it is particularly important that the swedish presidency has been so effective in ensuring the completion of the ratification process of the lisbon treaty , managing the transition to this new treaty while achieving all the other objectives .
a compulsory written examination in the country of residence has been retained as a requirement to practice this occupation , with the possibility of an exemption for 10 years ' continuous practical experience .
the financial crisis shows what a strong european currency and an effective central bank mean to the protection of the eu 's growth and economy .
usually , we do not get much further than elegant allusions .
pushed by poverty , hunger , squalor and war , people will keep crossing the mediterranean whether they fit our criteria or not .
( it ) madam president , once again , we have witnessed the inability of the italian government to protect the pro - european reputation of italy and the interests of its businesses on a crucial point such as the adoption of the european patent .
written statements ( rule 149 )
the aim of acta is to combat large - scale illegal activities , and to protect the european union 's innovators .
the problem is in fact twofold : there is the ecological problem and then there is the diplomatic problem .
that can lead us to underestimate the significance of this all , however .
in contrast , much more attention should be paid to the traditional ties to russia .
i would have liked to have seen greater commitment from the commission in this respect .
and , as we have all experienced in the last two years , this is also a vitally important issue when it comes to energy and foreign relations .
the implementation of a comprehensive action plan of the stockholm programme that the commission will be adopting later today is focused precisely on ensuring that the benefits of european integration in the area of freedom , security and justice become more tangible to the citizens .
the measures adopted today will set a precedent for the continuing international negotiations .
we are also keen to see that this policy option , if it is introduced , should be applied uniformly across all transport modes , so that no market distortion takes place .
the common register will be a step forward towards greater transparency in the european institutions , which hopefully will help give the european project greater legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens .
we should remember the inflationary effects of rising food prices .
oral explanations of vote
we attacked incentive .
the directive also enables the member states to allow managers to offer alternative funds to non - professional investors as well .
lastly , this is not a problem of the past .
previously it was only the industry . now farmers can say ' i want to leave and i want my eur 300 per tonne , and i get the compensation for the reduction in prices on top of that ' .
composition of parliament : see minutes
this is a precarious situation and i appeal to commissioner malmström to intervene in this issue with urgency .
shell fishermen in ireland are being negatively impacted by cheap imports from the united states and canada due to the weak dollar .
i believe this should be put on the agenda for copenhagen , but it should also be put on the agenda for the forthcoming european union summit with india and other summits with the countries affected .
( fr ) madam president , i have heard a great deal said about industry in this debate , and i would not like copenhagen to make the mistake of forgetting about agriculture .
following the shut - down of 34 radio stations , the government of hugo chávez officially announced there was a list of other stations which are about to be closed down as well : a list which nobody is aware of because the procedures are not open , and a list over which a great deal of uncertainty hangs , the sole purpose of which is to promote self censorship .
as there has also been a public debate on this issue , i would like to say that this article 29 , decided by the council , means that the governments of the member states take a decision whether to apply the old rules or the new rules to re - elected members .
why was nothing said about a real european initiative for the taxation of financial transactions ?
you can rest assured that the council officers who are here will pass on to the presidency all the comments that you have made and that other members will make .
it is in the interests of the democratic credibility of the iraqi government , as well as the us administration , which has granted their status as protected persons , to protect their lives , respect their free will and dignity and guarantee their safe future under international law .
in view of the time i am afraid i will not take the further supplementary question .
of course we must also correct what can be corrected , but we should have , on this issue , a confident and positive attitude and a belief that we are on the right road in line with our humanist traditions .
( fi ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the result of the irish referendum was clear and was an excellent signal both for europe and for ireland .
in writing . - the convention on future multilateral cooperation in the north - east atlantic fisheries , to which the eu is a contracting party , was approved by council decision 81/608 / eec and entered into force on 17 march 1982 .
to our best knowledge , unfortunately , no adequate alternatives to cyanide use for gold extraction exist on the market .
there are other issues , too , where europe must show solidarity .
in a context of increasing mobility and migration , it is essential for people to master the national language or languages if they are to become fully integrated into society .
mr barroso , i fully and completely accept that you expressed your opinion , and the report .
the package submitted by president barroso to the parliament is a step forward and it is encouraging that the council recognizes that the eu must agree on a range of policies before the end of 2008 .
now , at second reading , the other side of the coin must be addressed , namely agreement on the inter - institutional debate on parliament 's right to democratic scrutiny .
it is therefore the occasion for our parliament to stress the benefits consequent to a genuinely completed single market .
furthermore , the croatian government urgently has to address the structural weaknesses of the economy and devote greater attention to regional cooperation , in order to tackle bilateral issues with neighbouring countries .
they demand not only that the regulation be rescinded , but also that a special independent commission be appointed under the auspices of the european parliament to investigate and explain the principles and method of counting fish numbers in the baltic sea following enlargement of the union in 2004 , and to grasp the extent of the irregularities .
the most recent expression of this offensive is the unlawful intervention in portugal by the ' troika ' of the international monetary fund , the european commission and the european central bank .
the introduction of fingerprints and photographs will ensure that the new visas cannot be forged or misused .
this is the least we can do .
( de ) madam president , i 'm delighted to be given the opportunity of taking the floor in the first meeting to be chaired by you .
we cannot take responsibility for the development of kosovo .
we have therefore chosen to vote against this report on the commission 's budget for 2010 .
the car industry is another growing problem .
president of the commission . - frankly speaking , i do not believe that there is now openness among all member states to consider eurobonds for this kind of expenditure .
15-20 % of european young people have suffered harassment on the internet .
i would also like to say that it is the major issues that are always on our table .
producer organisations account today for 40 % of the total output of fruit and vegetables .
allow me to single out a couple of further examples .
we waited to submit our final result .
secondly , the main goal of the common agricultural policy must continue to be to maintain market stability and food security .
of course , in the case of reserves , probably to be voted , i have to reiterate the position of the commission and we are , of course , striving to respond to the conditions set by parliament as early as possible .
we expect that progress to start now .
today is no ordinary day for the european parliament : it is a day when we call to mind a fundamental concern of the european union : the work towards peace , progress and human rights exemplified by the sakharov prize laureates .
we are aware that all food hygiene legislation is a sensitive matter and therefore very time - consuming .
mr president , giving money from one 's own pockets is an act of generosity .
so , in my opinion , the recovery plan and the third energy package is something that needs to be done .
it is also regrettable , for example , that , if crucial information is not provided , a contract will still exist one year on .
there is an old jewish joke which says that , if you have two options , always choose the third .
cohesion policy needs to be increasingly participative and civil society needs to play a greater role in designing and managing the projects .
nor is it a coincidence that the member states took an almost unanimously dismissive stand on this dossier in the council .
some projects have simply been pushed back so that , in the foreseeable future , we then have the prospect of only the most immediate major expenditure .
the report rightly stresses that temporary measures are insufficient and that any attempt to create a system outside the eu 's institutional framework is a threat to the union project ; for this reason , it also rightly calls for a more significant role for the european commission .
however , when i consider our agricultural production and the products themselves , not everything can be proven scientifically .
nevertheless , there must be early destruction of data belonging to innocent members of those targeted groups .
we have to work together to fight tax fraud and dubious tax havens .
this approach is malicious and counter - productive .
sweden , austria and finland took that route , while countries such as switzerland , iceland and norway followed a different path .
i am certain his result will be even better .
for example , it will lead to serious market distortions within the eu and impose unwarranted burdens on consumers .
we all have a responsibility to sustain this fishery , and indeed all fisheries , but i referred to this one in particular .
i agree with the report 's thesis according to which the most important thing is student mobility , with the creation of a system of incentives and facilitations , so that young people may take advantage of offers to study wherever they like .
the other states , too , are starting to articulate their claims more strongly .
for that reason , traditional fishing methods should be encouraged ; these provide thousands of people with a livelihood and are much more selective .
there are several significant aspects of the adopted report that are positive : first , the need to regulate imports and ensure that all animals and meat imported from third countries meet the same welfare requirements as are applied in the eu ; second , the need to adequately cover the additional costs resulting from animal welfare promotion ; third , recognition of the limited investment capacity of many small and medium - sized producers , damaged by the unfair way in which the food supply chain works ; and , lastly , the proposal for incentives for the regional breeding , marketing and slaughter of animals in order to obviate the need for animals to be transported over long distances for rearing or slaughter .
another decisive point in my opinion is that we still need something on the question of out - of - court settlements .
i would like to point out that for 2010 , a fishing quota of 3 500 tonnes has been decided .
on 15 february , iran was subjected to a universal periodic review , which reviews the situation regarding the protection and promotion of human rights in the country .
this applies equally to our member states and the democracy in turkey .
the csangos , who also live in dire circumstances in one particular area ?
i therefore urge the commission in the long term to come forward with plans to ensure that there will be some sort of stability mechanism for the benefit not only of producers but also , of course , of consumers in the long term .
so i do not want to go further because we will have a number of occasions to be in contact with parliament .
therefore , i encourage support for mr stockmann 's report once again .
i stand here fortunate , as a gay man - and if i chose to be gay , is it not interesting that one obviously therefore chooses to be heterosexual ? - fighting for equality , not just for gay men and lesbians and bisexuals and transgender people , but for people on the basis of their age , their religion , their belief , their gender , anything that is perceived to be different that could be used to take equality away from them .
i also believe it important to further integrate the outermost regions into the european research area as well as promoting cooperation with neighbouring regions .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , mr barrot , and all of you attending here today , the european parliament firmly supports the abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the western balkans .
that should be taken into account .
yet it is also clear , mr president , that , under your presidency , our parliament has continued its gradual transformation from an institution that demands and fights for democracy to an assembly that is all too often submissive and careful not to rock the boat of this or that government .
in 2006 the european union made its position on the provision of public services clear and did not even subject the sensitive area of public services to open competition .
homeowners and tenants will be well - informed , with specific details of the energy consumption and potential energy savings of a building .
we must be aware - and this really is a crime - that these people are being exploited even in a progressive confederation of states such as europe .
i thank mr saryusz - wolski for having addressed this matter .
one year later , we are getting new rules , new instruments and more ambitious policies .
here i would like to point out that rightly or wrongly , for example in my country in the past , mass grubbing - up operations were carried out , for which , however , no financial assistance measures are now included at european level .
the european right - wing is getting ready simply to abolish the goals of the europe 2020 strategy .
if anybody today said that the victims of the holocaust deserve less attention than the gas chambers , they would put their credibility in question .
i must say that this visit takes place under favourable circumstances .
as my fellow member from lithuania pointed out just now , barely 8 % of lithuanians who went abroad to work used the instruments offered by eures .
i supported the resolution because , despite the economic and financial downturn and the instability in north african countries , european institutions should not and cannot fail to support japan both economically and in terms of humanitarian aid .
i urge and await an official position from mr buzek .
i should like to emphasise that european citizens want parliament to perform its duties impeccably and , in order to safeguard this , it is important for its members , its committees and its political groups to have the necessary resources .
i understand them , but i am nevertheless encouraging them to commit themselves fully to a cooperation process with their acp neighbours , so as to enable complementary and supportive relationships to be built around common aims .
i voted in favour of the resolution on the transparency and current position of the anti - counterfeiting trade agreement ( acta ) negotiations because i support a transparent process in the conduct of negotiations .
mr president , i want to congratulate my colleague mr hutchinson on the excellent report he has written on a very important subject .
since the new commission has not yet taken office , we should ask the president of the commission to attend such a discussion himself or to send somebody who will have a post in the new commission , such as mr almunia or mr rehn .
the russian government should do everything in its power to prove that it did not order the terrorist assassination of a british citizen - which also means a european citizen - alexander litvinenko .
it opens a single door to 27 labour markets .
space policy and the gnss programme are of strategic importance and should provide tangible benefits for citizens and businesses .
for this reason , i voted in favour of the regulation .
i would like to wish mr ortuondo luck with an excellent report and look forward to the commission implementing the action plan .
furthermore , the eu 's common agricultural policy will have to be adapted to a new economic and social climate at local and regional level , which will take into account the increase in energy costs .
indeed , the united states , which we vilify for not ratifying kyoto , is actually doing better than the eu in terms of emissions trend .
( applause )
i now wonder , given that these agencies are not yet operational , whether it might not be worth considering whether to have one single european agency working through 25 offshoots in the different countries .
ensuring the freedom of the press , on the other hand , actually is a matter that should be dealt with at eu level .
it should include action which will guarantee peaceful coexistence in the future .
even if you look at america there is tax competition within the states and it appears to be working extremely well there .
baroness ashton has our full support .
moreover , i must mention that in its statement of 9 february 2010 , the council promised to negotiate an interinstitutional agreement with parliament on this topic .
a reduction in the vat rates for locally supplied and labour - intensive services should have a positive impact , since it will reduce the level of undeclared labour , whilst also reducing its appeal and increasing demand within the formal economy .
however - and here we are in accord - this progress is not enough .
that is a sign , in my view , of strength and not of weakness .
this evening , i will suggest that my group votes against this agreement .
the fundamental preconditions for achieving the overall objectives of cohesion policy are sound financial discipline and transparency in the allocation of funds .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mrs napoletano , first allow me to congratulate you on the work done , since it has allowed a report to be produced that is genuinely important on several levels .
that proves that it was at least possible to perfect the barcelona process and we will all focus our efforts in that direction .
one possible measure would also be to extend the erasmus programme , currently intended for students , to other socio - professional groups as well , such as young people without university qualifications or unemployed people included in professional retraining programmes .
i support mr cercas 's report which protects employee interests without ignoring the legitimate interests of employers , offering them the opportunity to adapt working hours to their needs .
the agency should have adequate powers to achieve its tasks and i was able to support the report which ensures these powers whilst guaranteeing the independence of national regulators .
on behalf of the alde group . - ( lt ) we are considering a very important document , which should help reform the european statistical system .
nobody says that , in deciding to send our soldiers to war for profit , tony blair also put his country in danger [ . . . ]
that would be more intelligent , healthier , safer and greener .
we need one another , and i hope things will develop in a direction where , one day , gender no longer plays such a big role as skills and expertise .
i think that the eu 's accession to the european convention on human rights is a step towards extending human freedom and the freedom of the individual .
therefore , the heading for this legislative procedure which we have brought to an initial agreement should not read sarkozy but sacconi .
approval of minutes of previous sitting : see minutes
the call from the european parliament and request submitted to the european commission to come up with a specific proposal to set up a civil protection force which can respond quickly in the event of a natural disaster anywhere in the world must be answered .
does the commission have information concerning cross - border trading in shares and investment services ?
the events of august and september have proved that there is no need to travel here and that the parliament building in brussels is more than capable of coping with our official sittings , and that eu citizens would be far happier if we discontinued this monthly commute .

in writing . - ( pt ) i agree on the whole with this motion for a resolution , which concerns the anti - counterfeiting trade agreement ( acta ) , approved after long months of debate and efforts to find a compromise solution between the various political groups , which was unfortunately not achieved .
i want to emphasise the fact that practices of this kind are already banned under the terms of directive 2006/114 / ec concerning misleading and comparative advertising and of anti - fraud legislation in the various member states .
only they first have to obtain a piece of paper giving them permission for that .
the next item is the report by mr christensen , on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , on common principles of flexicurity .
on the question of who should collect the charges , my view is that subsidiarity is still the best way because , after all , it is not member states , but citizens , that pay .
however , if the translation costs are deemed to be insupportable in future , the minimum must be that the verbatim report contains the speaker 's original language and an english translation .
in this sense , it is necessary for the mff 's values to match the ambition and commitment that the europe 2020 strategy constitutes .
i believe that this directive constitutes a positive step towards bringing clarity and legal certainty both for taxable persons and for the administrations , whilst providing additional means to fight against value added tax fraud .
based on these financing instruments and within the budget outlook for 2014-2020 , the commission must also identify a financing solution for exploiting gas from alternative sources , which could have a far - reaching impact on the european gas and energy market .
my group would like to repeat that the failure to include the european parliament , the civil society organisations that have so far been affected , or even the national parliaments , gives rise to serious questions .
it is a dangerous measure , and it is scandalous that it has been integrated into a report aimed at taking into account the strategic importance of agriculture .
we need to send a clear message to them .
- ( nl ) whilst the resolution on guantánamo contains a number of elements that confirm the very foundations of the rule of law , i am not happy , of course , with the underlying tenor of this text , namely that the detainees of guantánamo would be victims of some sort that deserve our sympathy .
measures to consider include : freezing of financial assets , ban on transactions , investment restrictions ; trade restrictions on particular goods ; travel restrictions ; diplomatic constraints and cultural and sports restrictions .
the consequence of climate change for the arctic will be another important element of our discussions at the summit .
in recent months the presidency , together with the commission , has invested a lot of effort at the highest level in trying to overcome the remaining obstacles on the eu side .
i have a suggestion to make : this resolution is a rigorous one and it needs to be , but there is no need to kill the sinner .
i am therefore pleased about the commitments made by the council and the commission , and i will therefore call upon my group to vote in favour of ratification tomorrow , even though the long weeks of work we have just experienced lead me to think that , far from reaching an end , the collective agreement we have made is only just beginning .
however , this should not replace the bilateral agreements under the flegt programme - indeed quite the reverse .
they represent a source of raw materials for the food processing industry , as well as food for developing countries , particularly those in west africa .
( lt ) madam president , today , as we debate what is a sensitive issue for my country lithuania , i would , above all , like to stress that , as an eu member state , lithuania respects human rights and freedoms and eu values .
( applause )
however , we should point out that the report fails to address the causes of situations that it sometimes diagnoses .
it appears to me that we buy into the propaganda of whatever the flavour of the day happens to be .
in fact , commissioner barnier went the extra mile to reconcile conflicting views and tensions and to incorporate different priorities of the various stakeholders .
i would like to ask for a roll - call vote on this .
i would be very sorry if this is the position of the ppe - de group , because we all agree on the need to maintain development aid at the level it is today , and we all know that it is shrinking with the economic crisis .
let me go straight to your specific questions - there were quite some of them - and try to point out straightforwardly what the commission is already doing in this sector .
fourthly , transparent criteria have been introduced for allocating funds .
mr president , thank you for these important points of view .
i am afraid that i have to start with some sad news .
we will see how it is implemented in the future .
the annual cost of road traffic congestion in the eu is about 1 % of gdp ;
i am very pleased to welcome the orientation of this fund toward the field of labour and labour safety , but i also emphasize the importance of education in this field and the need to take into consideration this area , as well , in the future fund mobilizations .
in writing . - it is hard to think of anything more horrific and primitive than female genital mutilation .
the european parliament is becoming co - legislator for 95 % of european legislation .
it will stimulate economic attractiveness , particularly through cultural tourism .
finally , we can even bin the united nations charter , but in that case we shall cease to know what our role in world politics is based on , and in what way we differ from other players in world politics .
so it seems reasonable to me to ask the commission to demonstrate the validity of this measure , and if it is proven , to provide for uniform application , in total transparency .
we are opposed to the manipulation of that memory , and to the insulting of that memory , where it is used today in an ideological battle , in a party fight in the european political system .
i believe that we should congratulate ourselves .
furthermore , madam president , the compensation measures envisaged will not be enough to ultimately prevent the ruin that lies in store for small planters , nor to lead the acp countries , which are some of the poorest countries around , towards genuine development .
in this case they are also unduly liberal .
we are building today a whole new energy infrastructure in europe .
in september 2009 - in other words , one year after the collapse of lehman brothers - the regulation on credit rating agencies was adopted with parliament 's support ; i would like to pay particular tribute to the work of your rapporteur , mr gauzès , to address the problems caused by these agencies ' operating methods , which contributed significantly to the financial crisis .
closure of the sitting : see minutes
it is very simple ; the address is beatrice . ask @ justice . ministry . se and mr billström 's address follows the same format .

could you outline to me the current situation regarding this level of cooperation , and if you are particularly satisfied that the level of cooperation is good enough and strong enough ?
by now , both sides have become the prisoners of their own extremists and are unable to make real concessions because of them .
in this regard , the commission draws up daily updates , shared with the health security committee communicators ' network and food safety authorities . in addition , the commission keeps its website dedicated to this outbreak up to date .
the european union 's generalised system of preferences ( vote )
will they talk to our american counterparts and try and get more information ?
setting up the european systemic risk board , legislation for which is currently being considered by the parliament , is part of the correct response to this challenge .
that is where this responsibility should lie .
i would like to remind you that the incentives to encourage sustainable cultivation of energy crops should not jeopardise food production .
mr president , it is precisely in this context that it is so important for europe and africa to work together towards a joint eu - africa strategy for africa 's development .
mr president , an absolute majority is not the same as the rule of law .
as part of that compromise , the commission has agreed to make the following statement :
( applause )
when we speak about trafficking in human beings , we must think about not only sexual exploitation , forced labour and illegal adoptions , but also the problem of trafficking in organs , which is becoming an increasingly widespread crime .
we must therefore concentrate on the ongoing negotiations .
to be able to do that , therefore , it must have the necessary budget appropriation .
claude turmes has finally agreed a compromise that we can fully support , since it opens up all opportunities for the purposeful use of renewable energy sources .
access to funding is vital , along with the legal and administrative facilities .
that post has been abolished totally , so transparency of information about the state , for example on public procurement , is not there anymore .
this is not the side of unfettered competition , but that of social solidarity , redistribution , diversification and cultural values .
the european charter on the rights of energy consumers is a way to support the citizens in order for them to obtain information about their rights in a more efficient and simple way .
i trust , however , that mr duff 's influence in the new liberal democrat - conservative coalition government will improve this situation .
' calls on the member states , the commission and the council ... to assist in ascertaining the truth by opening inquiries or collaborating with the competent bodies , ... and by ensuring effective parliamentary scrutiny of the action of secret services ' ;
author . - mr president , the brutal theocratic regime in tehran seems to take a perverse pleasure in shocking the world and defying the civilised standards that characterise most other countries .
if we can put a stop to this , we will be closer to our goal .
the bali conference was supposed to pave the way for a post - kyoto consensus , but kyoto itself has failed .
rather , it strengthens their particular national identity and brings our european culture together so that we may be a more effective ambassador in the world .
acceptance of full cooperation with the osce would be counterproductive for the european union .
it is a very fine result .
this does not mean it will be a walk in the park , however , because this package will nonetheless cause a considerable increase in countrywide system costs .
otherwise , we will only increase our dependence on gas , particularly in central europe , where coal still plays an extremely important role .
we should be looking at 40 % by 2020 .
we need a regulatory framework at eu level , so that we do not end up discussing this every year .
thus , we must ban paedophiles ' chat rooms and internet forums , and make solicitation using such methods a criminal offence .
the answer to this question is that the ability to speak greek is required by meps .
we had , on the one hand , the bad cubans who were vassals of the soviet union intent on pursuing international revolution and , on the other hand , the good cubans , who rescued the country from the grip of the sugar barons , the mafia , the cia and us imperialism .
the global economic crisis burdens us all , yet we must not forget or ignore the fact that the least developed countries are also the most vulnerable now .
we should not ban the hunts traditionally conducted by inuit communities .
i should like to take this opportunity to stress the first - rate work of our development commissioner , louis michel , who has always swiftly and efficiently resolved to show solidarity and offer cooperation when these tragic events have occurred .
internally , europe has a big task ahead : it needs to implement the energy and climate package , to invest in clean technologies , scientific research and energy efficiency , to invest in a new industrial policy based on innovation and the efficiency of natural resources , to promote policies on low - carbon cities and sustainable transport and mobility .
this modern form of slavery must be combated ; provision must be made for support , protection and enhanced assistance to victims ; and prevention and monitoring must be strengthened .
i would like to stress that existing eu standards on aviation security were correctly implemented on 25 december at amsterdam schiphol airport .
they originate basically in increasingly neoliberal eu policies that concentrate financial and political power in the hands of the few .
you must thus follow the recommendations of the european parliament on a ban on the trade in bluefin tuna , but also ban the trade in polar bears and , moreover , have the african elephant placed on the said list in order to prevent it being increasingly hunted again .
mrs łukacijewska 's speech shows that even the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) is divided on this issue , which is good news .
important progress in maximising the digital dividend and other questions related to this can only be assured with the strategy and important political decisions agreed both by parliament and the council .
this new tool enables eu citizens to directly approach the commission and request that it submit a legislative proposal to address a particular matter .
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - ( nl ) madam president , mr president - in - office , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , this is the first time we have held the annual debate in which we prepare for the spring summit in the afternoon .
( el ) mr president , a fortnight ago , the heads of state or government decided to set up a new european solidarity mechanism to support economies with serious economic difficulties , such as greece , and to safeguard the stability of the eurozone .
it is a large portion of the eu 's budget and the member states have a clear responsibility in this regard .
i believe that we must decide whether to present a universalist and globalist vision or , instead , to preserve the contribution and the identity of each individual .
as coordinator of the committee on legal affairs , i would therefore like to draw particular attention to the importance , during the legislative procedure , of observing the principle of including small and medium - sized enterprises in ex ante and post ante impact assessments .
mr stockmann , as rapporteur , you will have the opportunity to speak at the end of the debate .
the choice of cost - cutting on labour is unrelated to the move to 120 grams of co 2 per km in 2012 .
it is about consumers having opportunities and rights and finding transparency in this important supply sector .
ms geringer de oedenberg : it may not be easy to grasp that the vast majority of the complaints , whether to the european ombudsman or the national ombudsman , do indeed deal with eu law .
that way , passengers will finally know which way to turn .
this summit is actually supposed to be an energy summit .
i hope that this view can still be changed .
however , i would like to denounce the demagoguery surrounding three proposed amendments aimed at modifying the rules on members travelling to and from their country of residence and parliament , and i voted against them .
because the eu has not had time to approve all the species now being used , the feed may contain small traces of these .
referring to mr tsoukalas 's question about the mediterranean regulation , we have decided that this mediterranean regulation has to be implemented .
i expressly disapprove of a situation where a sector which ought to be a driving force in our evolution towards a green economy has been anxious to evade this important environmental legislation and where a majority in parliament and the council have given in to the interests of one type of technology in particular ( the use of cadmium telluride thin - film solar panels ) .
still , all in all , i have no doubt that the eu will pass the test of globalisation with flying colours .
i would recall the convention on cybercrime and its additional protocol .
as i believe mrs ojuland mentioned here earlier , we are not a court .
without doubt it does represent an improvement on the older itta agreement of 20 years ago which , although it was billed as an agreement promoting both trade and sustainability , is in reality very much about trade and not very much about sustainability .
madam president , i would like to point out a problem with the allocation of speaking time in this debate .
this needs to be sorted out first and then we will find a sensible solution , but not one that is divided into small portions and distributed over three years .
we are in favour of this , as it should introduce more predictability into what remains a dramatic situation and do so in the interests , in particular , of the security to which children , who are too often the victims of the separation of their parents , are entitled .
in the words of the previous rapporteur , this can reasonably be described as ' as good as it gets ' .
i said it yesterday , i reaffirm it today .
you have to measure something to know about it , that is very important , but using the knowledge that we gain from doing so is even more important and that , surely , is the essential next step .
i also hope that you will all give your support to making g 20 an organisation that will continue for a long time .
the members who voted in favour of this text are those who time and again refused to table a resolution in this parliament condemning the coup that took place in honduras .
the greatest improvements were observed in relation to the common agricultural policy .
they have presented three good and well - thought through proposals and parliament is , therefore , not tabling many amendments .
- ( pl ) madam president , i would also like to speak on the subject of this directive .
all these steps could play their part in accelerating the development of a closer partnership between belarus and the european union .
it gives our fruit distilleries , in particular , the security to plan for the future beyond 2010 .
we also need to do more to promote fair trade , so that the developing and emerging countries finally get a fair chance .
is it mr de gucht ?
i look , of course , to the rome summit on the food crisis and food security : we invited robert mugabe and his henchmen to shop in some of the most luxurious shops of europe while his people were starving .
madam president , this initiative has been in gestation for almost three years and , for once , i found myself on the side of the council rather than of parliament .
mr president , the council is genuinely grateful for the huge commitment shown by the european parliament on this issue .
are we moving forward ?
allocating sufficient funds in this region to generate an alternative source of electrical energy and use the geothermal water will create new jobs and result in numerous economic benefits .
i would like to ask the commission to bring experts together so that we can properly assess the recent disasters .
injunctions for the protection of consumers ' interests ( codified version ) ( vote )
however , before we talk too much about dynamism here , i have to say that my group has been calling for a regulation since 2002 .
i hope that this additional instrument made available to european citizens will be easily accessible and , in particular , that the decision to accede to this convention will help create a more coherent framework for human rights within the european union .
in addition , the commission has had a fruitful dialogue with the main stakeholders over the last few years on possible adaptations to the existing eu rules - in particular , within the social protection committee and parliament 's intergroup on public services .
i know this because i was one of the sponsors of those negotiations .
the fourth democratic advance introduced by the reformed treaty regards the rights of national parliaments , which will reinforce the principles of accountability and subsidiarity .
the data collected may explain the potential distortions and contribute to finding adequate measures for correcting negative situations .
mr president , mr barroso , mr rehn , i should like to congratulate you in particular on the positive dialogue that parliament has held with the commission .
thirdly , adjustment of the relevant multilateral rules .
i welcome the introduction of this prohibition that was brought in recently , partially under pressure from the european union , by certain african countries .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the confederal group of the european united left - nordic green left will not be giving the resolution its backing .
in my country , the people were told that the lisbon treaty was so different from the european constitution that it was no longer justified to have a referendum , and yet the only substantive difference that i can find between the constitution and the lisbon treaty is the removal of these trappings of statehood .
protecting the environment is a matter of exceptional importance for the ep , which , after all , represents some 500 million europeans .
thirdly , the labour market must be reformed , flexibility and job security must go hand in hand with each other and we must invest more in people 's skills .
i am confident that subsequent negotiations on the establishment of the eeas will respect this balance .
hammering out suitable conditions for the eu - libya agreement , which means persuading the libyan authorities to end practices which violate fundamental human rights , to change migration policy and to accept legal responsibility , will bring mutual benefits and contribute to the region 's development .
however , that is not a bad thing , because i have made an effort and will continue making an effort to take up this opportunity .
ladies and gentlemen , whilst we are holding a plenary session at the start of the new year here , people are once again dying in the middle east .
the amendment is an overall revision of the convention , with the main purpose of bringing it more into line with other regional conventions and international instruments and incorporating modern fisheries management concepts into it , which is why i voted in favour of it .
the decision to hold youth olympics in 2010 follows these lines but the olympic spirit cannot prevail in school sports if we rely only on the four - year olympic cycle .
mr president , the euro is the successful outcome of a vision and political will , and not the product of the market .
( applause )
author . - madam president , i would like to express my thanks to the rapporteur for his profound work .
it is high time we called on mr obama to close down this disgrace and spare us the reproach of such hypocrisy .
thank you .
first , the efficient education and training of young people should be an eu priority .
bulgaria is a small country and the recession is at its height there .
i am very , very sorry for this day and i am very sorry for the broken promises of the labour government .
it was won by foul means , was it not ?
india has about a tenth of the average eu emissions and twenty times less than those of the usa .
against this background , systems of prior notification as proposed by the rapporteur could amount to indirect - and indeed unnecessary - control of patients , impeding rather than facilitating the process .
on the subject of the ' owner of the air ' , i think that the happiest organisations after the approval of this report will be the airlines , including ryanair .
nagoya / cancún are pretty much connected stories .
( el ) madam president , there is only one macedonia and it is greek , which is why these games need to stop .
grant aid allocated from the cohesion fund and available from regional cooperation programmes must reach the local level .
i voted for the report on key competences for a changing world : implementation of the education and training 2010 work programme .
mechanisms to regulate international trade and for effective financial market supervision need to be created to prevent speculative operations that benefit only a small minority at the expense of hundreds of millions of poor and defenceless people .
all member states will have to shed a lot of blood , sweat and tears to purge their debts , put their finances back in order and steer a different course .
however , we regret that such positive , practical aspects are secondary to the eu 's political motive to create an integrated european defence industrial base , and to strengthen the european security and defence policy , to which our opposition has been consistent .
secondly , it was established in order to adapt to the new configuration of threats , and particularly to globalisation and the fact that our armies do not have apparent enemies and our enemies do not have armies .
i believe that there is a need to explore the possibility of coordinating at european level issues related to international adoption , with a view to improving information services , preparation for inter - country adoption , processing of applications for international adoption and post - adoption services .
as members of parliament , it is vital that we are able to exercise our right of veto as often as is necessary , but our work has now been made virtually impossible .
people who uphold human rights in zimbabwe have been systematically targeted with arbitrary detention , arrest and torture .
( lv ) ladies and gentlemen , today 's summit meeting is focused on offering assistance to georgia .
i voted in line with my expressed views on this issue .
for example , there is to be a ticket for local public transport in brussels , and that is to be negotiated further .
of course , no one can suggest curtailing the right of individuals to smoke , not even for the sake of certain principles which we all support , such as strong protection for public health and an environment rid of sources of pollution .
perhaps it is unnecessary to point out who was president of the european commission at that time and who is now prime minister of italy , with a green minister ?
you can look at it this way : typically , a prospectus is a thick and voluminous document frequently containing several hundred pages .
the own - initiative report offers useful and widely shared suggestions for achieving the aim of an agricultural sector that combines quality and competitiveness .
mr president , to sum up , i believe that through the result of the irish referendum we are completing the process .
the services of the commission have fully taken on board the recommendations of parliament and we look forward to reviewing progress with you during our regular rendezvous where we have the opportunity to discuss the financial assistance strategies and their implementation .
furthermore , even though there are a great many differences in the conditions for confiscating a driving licence among the member states , and the systems for the scale of offences and fines in the field of road safety vary from one country to another , europe wants to establish an electronic system for member states to exchange information relating to offences committed on their territory , and in order to penalise motorists even more .
measures such as a european patent and the european professional identity card must be strengthened and applied widely in order to strengthen competitiveness and employment .
this amendment will allow european countries to extend the practical scope of the measures envisaged by these programmes and to seek assistance from international organisations in implementing them .
if public sector intervention has become central and essential once more , we must not make the same mistakes again - that would be even more unpardonable .
the principles of universality , access to high quality care , equity and solidarity must become a reality within the health systems of the european union .
green paper on the future of ten - t policy ( short presentation )
( ro ) i am pleased that today we are discussing the visa waiver for some balkan countries and i must tell you why : my grandparents were born in macedonia , my father in albania , my grandmother in greece and my mother in bulgaria , while i was born in romania .
can we perhaps start a fundamental debate on the way we wish to spend our funds and the rules underpinning this ?
this is also the view of the commission , and it is also the view of the majority of member states .
i totally agree with the rapporteur .
once the agreement has been ratified , which will be tomorrow , i hope , we must move resolutely to the next stage , which is its implementation .
perhaps it comes down to whether one regards the glass as half - full or half - empty .
as such , it is essential to continue offering them conditions to be able to develop and become secure in the market , by guaranteeing them access to finance and to the potential benefits of the single market .
i believe that un security council resolution 1970 only specifically bans the sale of arms to the jamahiriya and , therefore , not to the benghazi rebels , though unfortunately the eu legislation appears to transpose 1970 incorrectly , with a blanket arms embargo .
it seems that we are unable to complete what we have already agreed and we are flying forward , without taking care to avoid any overlaps or duplication of functions , to assess the impact of these issues on the fundamental rights of individuals or to establish safeguards where appropriate .
( pl ) mr president , when there are too many presidents , there are , in fact , none at all .
there is no general eu electorate and there cannot be one until perhaps in a century or two everyone speaks one language , and until that time comes eu democracy will be a joke , and a dark and dangerous joke at that .
the inhabitants of the country must not , however , become hostage to their political representatives , who have decided to implement their own version of democracy .
during our work , we developed a common position , which i consider a very ambitious one .
the report by mr grech , on behalf of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , on delivering a single market to consumers and citizens ,
in this regard i consider it essential that the commission , in close cooperation with the european investment bank , submits an overall proposal on an instrument for investing in energy from renewable sources , energy - efficiency projects and the development of intelligent networks no later than 2011 .
this is not the model of society which we on the left want or accept .
the commission 's statement on accounting requirements for medium - sized companies
if that opposition is maintained , can the council suggest any alternatives that have been put forward to maintain the momentum of the european economic recovery plan ?
i was very encouraged by your words , but was very discouraged to notice that only 12 colleagues were here to hear it .
last but not least , i am convinced that limiting car traffic in town centres and the use of public transport and bicycles are important indirect ways in which each of us can contribute towards the safety of pedestrians on our roads .
we will consider with the president of parliament and perhaps the conference of presidents the conditions under which you would like us to put this in place .
i particularly regret that amendment 37 was rejected , as i think it reflected , very fairly , many of the concerns of this house .
the european union has concluded bilateral association agreements with all of our mediterranean partners apart from syria , and these focus essentially on trade in goods .
this oil disaster should make us all consider whether leaving behind nuclear power would not be a way forward for europe .
the unequal performance of economies and the current crisis should not impose limits on securing equal opportunities for the provision of healthcare to eu citizens regardless of differences between health systems .
secondly , may i confirm that , indeed , there are rules here which revisit , as mr szájer pointed out , recent reforms that flowed from the first report of dagmar roth - behrendt 's reform working group .
i would point out that my french socialist colleagues and i voted against the financial perspective for 2007-2013 as far back as 2006 .
all this is true .
i would also like to thank my colleagues mr joseph daul and mr michael gahler for their support .
it will not help to get us out of the financial crisis , nor will it help prevent a new crisis , nor will it contribute to the stability of the financial markets .
the council and the commission must show willingness to act .
furthermore , the introduction of a trilingual system does not seem to conform to administrative requirements and does not even seem to reflect the demographic weighting of the member states , because in that case , italy should also be represented .
however , we must still provide for protection of european intellectual property and repatriate to europe patents for inventions created in europe , but currently kept in the united states .
in writing . - ( cs ) the proposed consumer rights directive harmonises into one legal document a total of four directives dealing with off - premises contracts , unreasonable terms in consumer contracts , consumer protection in distance contracts and certain aspects of the selling of consumer goods and guarantees .
we need policies which will cover the steps that young people have to take when making the transition from education to employment .
i am convinced that the amendments , as tabled to you now , constitute a balanced solution .
the most important of these are widespread poverty , the inadequacies of the health and education systems , the aids epidemic and the marked social contrasts .
if you will permit me , as we say in france , this has been the drop of water that has made the vase overflow , with this water having also been authorised for blending wine , just like the ' woodwork ' wines made with wood chips rather than in barrels were previously authorised , and the wines made with imported musts were nearly authorised .
in my opinion , we are not talking enough about climate change .
fortunately however , it did not succeed , despite the fact that it did not always provide us with the correct information .
i would just like to emphasise two aspects .
the commission needs to draw up a risk prevention strategy and an effective strategy for combating natural disasters , and a protocol for uniform action .
the democratic legitimacy of our actions at european level , in direct relation to the european parliament , is determined by the commission .
i also wanted to say that i voted in favour of this motion , given that enlargement is an important political gesture for the eu .
that is why our position is that gilad shalit , a member of the israeli armed forces arrested in israeli territory on 24 june 2006 , meets the criteria for him to be considered a prisoner - of - war under the third geneva convention .
as the rapporteur emphasises , europe needs an extra 700 000 researchers if the strategy 's principles are to be put into effect .
exact figures do not exist but , according to rough estimates , hundreds of thousands of women and girls are trafficked each year by criminal gangs , subsequently ending up in forced prostitution in our member states .
it is a key task to support the employment of older workers , particularly through greater flexibility in employment law relationships and the correct adjustment of pension systems ;
it is this sleight of hand that this parliament does not accept , and that is why we have not concluded the negotiations .
it is also worth remembering that peace is not only the absence of war .
with member states set to switch to entirely digital television broadcasts by 2012 , more spectrum will become available .
proof of origin for certain textile products (
as far as i am concerned , the highlight of the 2008 work programme is the proposal for a directive on equality outside the workplace , that is , a general prohibition of discrimination .
we now come to the second part of question hour , catch - the - eye .
mr president , on 14 december 2007 the european council asked the commission to present an eu strategy for the baltic sea region by july 2009 at the latest , an initiative that was also welcomed by the european parliament .
the country is called macedonia , whether that suits some people or not , and we must finally start to smooth this country 's way towards europe .
in that regard , i hope very much that you will be present and participate in this debate and will support the proposal of the commission .
again i will quote her words in her sadness : ' we do not want to go back into the dark days again of fear and terror .
i should also like to say to you that i believe that acceptance by the citizens of the european union would be much greater and would increase if mistakes which were made in the old economic strategies of the european commission , mistakes with regard to the financial markets as well , were to be assessed , if you were to acknowledge your incorrect estimates of a year ago .
they are exceptionally cautious when negotiations touch on these singapore topics , when they even discuss them , and are anxious for us to help them develop an understanding of how public goods can be used for society .
thirdly , the european union should adopt a more rational approach to the co 2 emissions reduction strategy , with a view to reducing emissions while avoiding high adaptation costs .
in order to guarantee a supply of feed for the european livestock sector , we must relieve farmers of their burden of red tape and create a framework of legal certainty .
i know how difficult it is to talk about financing today .
according to the new vat strategy , we should aim to reduce the administrative burden , remove tax obstacles and improve the business environment , especially for small and medium - sized enterprises .
member of the commission . - mr president , today is the culmination of what has been a very long , and very often intense , legislative process , and the efforts shown by all sides in the negotiations have produced results which were worth waiting for .
you know that , for the spanish partido popular , this is a question of state and that we will be behind you in everything that we regard as being in the common interests of europe and that is important to spain .
on the supply side , the crisis may lead to a reduction in the level of funding for public health , at the same time as it may lead to increased demand for health services .
the fate of the company must be linked to that of the manager and workers as well so that a safe service of suitable quality can be guaranteed , particularly in the state service sector .
if we in the eu are to achieve our goal of ensuring the welfare of our citizens , we need to give the women of the eu a proper opportunity to take maternity leave .
firstly , activating this mechanism provides assistance to member states in serious financial difficulty and , secondly , the mechanism requires those states , in return , to reduce their deficit .
the signatures must be collected in writing or over the internet and must be verified .
but the incredible thing was that many of the new bosses had also worked for that same evil system before .
it is important now that the guidance included in this report be implemented .
the member states may designate - as the rapporteur said - mixing zones , where concentrations of chemical substances may exceed the relevant environmental quality standards under certain circumstances , but of course they will have to reach and be monitored with great care .
all that the european parliament 's recommendation will do is to enable the council to agree officially to measures being taken .
the urban dimension must become mandatory .
as rapporteur for the committee on women 's rights and gender equality , i do believe , though , that more thought should be given to gender issues when dealing with this group of people who are staying in the european union illegally and , as has already been stated , are often the victims of exploitation .
first of all , the directive needs to be brought into line with the new legislative framework ( nlf ) .
the successful mobilisation of citizens can be seen in the example of oscar morales , who set up a facebook group called ' a million voices against the farc ' with the hope of collecting one million people online .
on behalf of the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe , i should like to start by praising the bank for its excellent work .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i voted in favour of mr siekierski 's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the community .
one point obviously remains to be settled and i want to make an observation about it : it is the epp 's amendment 10 .
what should this policy look like ?
voting time
after all , less than two months ago , this parliament violated the free expression of opinion , which it tries to defend so emphatically in every corner of the globe , from antarctica to the amazon rainforest and from abu ghraib to harare , in its own house .
if ireland is to continue providing fish to the rest of the eu and still have the means to provide for their families this is not acceptable .
mr president , amnesty international is an organisation with impeccable credentials , which , through its many years of hard work , has helped greatly in the fight against human rights abuses worldwide and has earned the respect of all those who care about justice , freedom and democracy .
just think - the european parliament has not yet been told anything at all about how these negotiations are going .
when it comes to the cia 's secret prisons and rendition flights , too , just how non - violent and respectful of human rights was the eu 's action then ?
one of the proposals in the commission communication concerns enhancement of the horizon 2020 initiative for the depollution of the mediterranean region , both a victim and a cause of climate change , and there can be no doubt that some very pragmatic action can be taken through this proposal .
in any case , the adoption of such legislation in france and belgium , in a pioneering spirit , is welcome ( with the united kingdom also examining the possibility of introducing similar legislation ) , and we expect to see its impact .
thank you .
it was the only international organisation to introduce clauses relating to respect for human rights and democratic values into its relations with tunisia .
it is easy to criticise but we have to give credit where credit is due .
yesterday , the house of commons in my country voted through a bilateral loans package to ireland which was supported , i think , by sincere and generous mps thinking that they were helping a friendly country .
similarly , the gsp schemes should be given proper teeth and be enforceable .
the portuguese presidency , under a socialist government , has an obligation to try to make a difference .
in writing . - ( de ) demographic change towards an increasingly older society in conjunction with the setbacks in the areas of economic growth , state finances and the financial markets caused by the economic and financial crisis make it necessary to adapt our practices with regard to pensions .
first of all , at a humanitarian level , we need every person arrested arbitrarily to be released , the bodies of the victims to be handed over to their families , and all the injured , especially women who have been raped , to receive medical care .
i support a strategic framework that goes even further in the help granted to smes in times of recession , and this in many areas .
the need to examine these circular migration opportunities , based on the communication from the commission of 16 may 2007 , was also reiterated in the conclusions of the june 2007 european council .
that would not be reasonable , it would not be responsible and it would not be worthy of a self - respecting statesman .
it seems to me that the report on the crisis in the eu livestock sector that we have voted on works along these lines .
citizens will be confronted with a two - fold increase in energy prices .
the impact assessment of this measure demonstrated that just over a 1 % increase in female labour participation would cover the costs of 20 weeks paid maternity leave and two weeks paid paternity leave .
on behalf of the efd group . - mr president , i am sorry to dissent , but as an experienced accountant , i do not share my colleagues ' optimism about the opinion of the auditors .
it will need to change in order to reflect both the challenges of the times in which we now live but more the times which are to come .
we must accept the fact that nuclear power is being generated and will be generated in europe .
that is something that parliament has repeatedly called for since 1997 .
i would like to close by remembering the women of the world who are fighting for the most basic of rights and i would like this house to express its solidarity with the iranian feminist associations that are today taking to the streets , inviting women to demonstrate without the hijab .
i would like to begin by highlighting the excellent report produced by mrs patrão neves .
on behalf of every new member state , i wish to register my protest .
the gdynia and szczecin yards have benefited from state support for many years at the expense of other shipyards in europe .
citizens both in the united states and here want less government intrusion in their lives , control of the deficit and cuts in public expenditure , and for us that should mean a smaller eu budget .
in addition , the european union must also focus on financing the appropriate measures for adapting to climate change .
however , 20 million immigrants does not mean 20 million skilled immigrants .
it is time to reverse the trend and reindustrialise the european union and restore its ability to be innovative and create jobs in sectors linked to r&d and new technologies .
the next item is the debate on five motions for a resolution on the arrest of demonstrators following the presidential election in russia .
she has put in a huge amount of hard work , which is a rare occurrence these days .
while we are discussing the most difficult problem faced by europe , you are organising splendid summits in madrid - we will not begrudge you that - but it does require us to be here .
1 .
the instability in the mediterranean and suez gives our arguments about the importance of coal greater significance .
member of the commission . - ( fr ) obviously it is extremely frustrating for meps , in a debate as important as this one and with such an excellent report , to have so little time .
( posiedzenie zostało otwarte o godz .
it is a long process ; we cannot expect to solve everything at once , and it is also very complicated , but primarily it must , in my opinion , be an inclusive , participative process built from the bottom up : a partnership between equals .
thus , i believe that member states should put greater efforts and means into promoting solvit and raising awareness amongst citizens and businesses .
therefore , were we to take up the amendments that he suggests , we would actually be moving backwards with regard to control and enforcement , rather than strengthening the provisions that need to be strengthened .
i want everyone to have a chance to speak , but for mrs espinosa and commissioner rehn to be able to respond , you must all speak for just one minute .
last weekend was a triumph for communication .
in its communication , the commission refers to universities and colleges being given real autonomy .
rapporteur . - ( es ) mr president , as you all know , the members of the court of auditors are nominated by the council , for a six - year mandate , following consultation with parliament .
the co - rapporteurs note a lack of vision and ambition shown by national leaders in the european arena , and even downright mistrust of the eu and its institutions .
since then a whole series of events have taken place , as the commission and the council have reminded us .
the european parliament has , on several occasions , pointed the finger at the obvious idiocies of international finance , but its voice was not heard .
we expect you to make progress on this matter .
it is sick to see criminals from the albanian and serbian sides working together very well in a multi - ethnic effort .
new strategies will be required , first and foremost in the short term .
in that respect , i welcome the fact that for the first time there is a broad consensus in parliament for the inclusion of a sectoral approach .
even though the opposition has stood down , we refuse to acknowledge the result of the elections , which have become puppet elections .
a state of emergency is justified by natural disasters or catastrophes or events of that kind .
unfortunately , there are limits to international cooperation and at present we can only deplore the us congress 's unilateral decision on 100 % scanning of container cargo in eu ports .
the treaty of lisbon has already made a great contribution in this direction ; that is , it has established new rules to ensure greater power for parliament , but this alone is not enough .
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first , in the middle of these quiet debates , in this very comfortable atmosphere , i want to paint the scene for you , as i have been over there three times in recent months .
the human rights situation also deserves our attention , given the existence of political prisoners - and that is the word for them : political prisoners - in all three countries .
the banks ' profits stay in the hands of the shareholders and excessive bonuses are paid to a small number of employees , while the losses are nationalised .
moreover , the statistics show that there are minimal differences in the case of young people .
the eit mark will facilitate the choice of partners or managers for training and research projects .
this proposal strengthens administrative cooperation between the eu member states in the field of taxation , as the process of european integration shows a clear imbalance between the legislation produced and the mechanisms of control and surveillance .
that is why i decided to vote against the resolution .
it appeared that we were not being irresponsible .
i therefore think it is right to simplify the rules for the electronic identification of animals , and to create a telephone helpline in every eu member state to provide better access to information .
mr president , i invite you to ask the men in white coats to offer their services to our colleague .
these trade concessions , as the report itself acknowledges , will harm the european union 's textile industry , and the countries and regions most dependent on it .
on behalf of the efd group . - madam president , the 2.3 % increase in the budget requested by this parliament calls into question its sense of responsibility .
i say again that i believe that it is right to do this with parliament , with the commitment that i have made - and i repeat it now , at the conclusion of this debate - to officially consult the european data protection supervisor and listen to the views of the european union agency for fundamental rights .
on behalf of the alde group . - ( fr ) madam president , mrs győri , commissioner , thank you for being with us this evening .
will cohesion policy continue to serve mainly the least developed regions of the union ?
the fact is that whenever politics claims to be infallible , it gets something wrong .
statistics on plant protection products (
we cannot simply make adjustments just like that .
thirdly , it would be too absurd for words if we , in this european union , were to opt for new nuclear plants .
i wish to emphasise , in particular , the importance of the rapid , specific assistance which should be given to the republic of moldova 's pro - european government .
for smes , the european private company seems an effective way of accessing the european market .
i do not support the directive in its present form .
there are lots of working groups going on in order to prepare for the full implementation of the treaty .
the report sets out a list of transparency rules that apply today to the different players in the financial markets in the eu .
we must coordinate our cooperation and learn from each other .
this measure may also include enrichment of apicultural flora in certain areas .
i also support , however , the opinion of the european parliament that there is no need to create a special process allowing the commission to revise this limit outside the usual decision - making procedures .
the number of member states participating in eu resettlement programmes has been increasing and must be extended to the greatest possible number of member states .
none of the turkmenistan key partners - russia or china , which are currently increasing their influence in the region - are likely to put these issues high on their agendas .
( fi ) mr president , the 2008 olympics are a unique opportunity for europe to initiate a debate on the events in tibet and the universal humanitarian values agreed by the united nations .
we are appealing for the release of a hostage , because we do not agree with the idea that the end justifies the means .
i will limit myself to the following facts .
financial transactions are typified by a hefty increase in volume and by a noticeable disparity between the volume of financial transactions and the needs of the real economy .
i also have some news which is very important for us .
thanks to its constant and close cooperation , the civil aviation authorities in member states are stepping up the supervision of their carriers .
however , i believe more radical changes are necessary in this area , and we are very much looking forward to the work of the high - level group chaired by jacques de larosière , which will also look at supervision , particularly the issue of the supervision of investment funds .
this will have important elements related to the rule of law and independence of the judiciary .
i shall take the liberty of saying that i am amazed by such statements , because we have actually known for a long time that these were not exactly democratic regimes and that , instead , they were authoritarian or very authoritarian regimes which kept their peoples under their thumb .
i can suggest a date , mr president : the first fortnight in may 2008 , because this is the fortnight that saw the end of the second world war , and sees europe day on 9 may , and this year it will be the sixtieth anniversary of the hague congress , which set europe in motion , chaired by winston churchill .
madam president , in my view , europe 's car industry has shown remarkable resilience in the past few years , despite some extremely tough economic conditions and a veritable deluge of eu legislation .
trialogues have been initiated to seek an agreement with the council .
copenhagen will not succeed unless europe plays a strong leading role , as we all know .
the new member states must also make sure that they maintain sufficient freedom of movement and competitiveness in order to resolve the deepening structural and employment problems they have retained after the eastern european changes of regime .
we now have an opportunity to obtain these facts .
could it be that our tactics and activities have yielded no results at all or have even had negative consequences ?
i sincerely hope that the ' pierre de coubertin ' action plan that forms part of the white paper will be taken seriously by the member states and that the commission will provide the necessary guidance and , where appropriate , economic assistance from the development funds at its disposal .
ladies and gentlemen , the first item today is the commission statement on the eastern partnership .
mr daul has expressed his determination that the largest group should propose the president of the commission , as was the case five years ago .
it is clearly the most important player out of the eastern partnership countries .
in other words , we are dealing with a common neighbourhood .
( the president cut off the speaker )
however , setting objectives without robustly and consistently addressing the status quo and the tasks to be completed and without analysing what needs to be done now makes little sense in my view .
( nl ) i voted against the new commission because there is not a single indication that the new commission will start to work on reducing the gap between the average european and the european institutions , in particular , the european commission .
on behalf of the alde group . - madam president , some european governments actively participated in illegal rendition , torture and illegal detention .
many problems that today affect the majority of the baltic states , for example - you mentioned poland , but i could , of course , mention bulgaria , romania , hungary - are due to the fact that they are not in the euro area .
we must give the industrial sectors time to prepare .
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - mr president , let us first of all look at the background to this .
secondly , we must keep open all possible channels of communication with the government .
we believe that the lack of a common set of regulations for the transfer of the registered office of a company creates problems for companies wanting to move across borders within the internal market , as they are currently forced to liquidate the company and thus wind the business up in order to be able to move their registered office .
( it ) mr president , commissioner , president - in - office of the council , ladies and gentlemen , we are absolutely duty - bound to act so that women can realise their maternal function in optimum health conditions .
we must , however , do whatever is required to speed up the mobilisation of this instrument , particularly in view of its positive role in tackling the economic crisis .
i must say - perhaps taking issue with some of you - that aid to developing countries should not be confined to support for african countries , and i would remind you that the european consensus of 2005 does not oblige us to direct our development aid to africa .
i wonder who would guarantee that this data was protected from abuse and arbitrary actions on the part of states to the same extent as has hitherto been the case .
before concluding , i would like to briefly explain what you will not find in the commission work programme and why .
to conclude , i welcome the adoption of the report , which shows that the egf is a useful and effective resource for combating unemployment resulting from globalisation and the economic crisis .
if we want to further the growth of our european film industry and promote the idea of europe , we not only need better quality , which is already very good but could be even better , but we must also give our creative artists financial assistance .
that creates threats everywhere to labour codes , threats to the reductions in working time that were planned , and downward pressure on the cost of labour , which is very damaging .
i cannot stress enough the importance of issues like transparency , simplification and redistribution , which are essential , and are clearly outlined in this report and in the positions parliament has been adopting .
eleven thousand palestinian prisoners are in jail .
in writing . - ( fr ) i voted for the report by our spanish colleague raül romeva i rueda on the murder of women , or feminicides , in central america and mexico and the role of the eu .
however , based on the experience of my own country , lithuania , i must emphasise the importance of the programmes you are debating for a country 's economy , not to mention the culture of a small country .
i would like to draw your attention to a specific situation in nicaragua .
i thank you for that .
it is not within the remit of this parliament to decide how much hungarian is taught in schools in slovakia or romania , but yet it feels entitled to decide whether maths should be taught in tibetan or another language .
we urgently need answers to the questions of what that thick red substance is - is it really hazardous to health ?
there are not many ways to combat terrorism and the way in which the west is going about it is certainly not one of them .
we now move on to a very different subject area .
there is another approach , however , which consists of treating energy , gas and their supply as a public service that should be provided to all on the basis of equality and territorial adjustments .
17 .
however , just at the moment when the government was formed , the opposition decided that the elections had not been properly conducted and called for the ballot boxes to be opened .
the 27 member states of the european union have a total of 500 million inhabitants .
on 26 october 2004 president barroso promised in this parliament and during this commission 's term of office a framework directive on - i quote - ' all forms of discrimination ' .
if europe really intends to implement the policies enshrined in the treaties , including the new policies found in the treaty of lisbon , it needs the financial wherewithal to realise those aims .
i shall be brief .
however , since member states - and especially the new member states - did not want to be in a position where that money was earmarked in such a way that , if it was not spent , then it was lost , we included the eur 120 million in the national envelopes , so that member states can decide for themselves .
we certainly have sleepers within the eu , who could become active at any time .
we therefore have reason to hope , on the one hand , for fresh positive dynamism among traders freed from unscrupulous competitors and , on the other , renewed confidence for reassured consumers .
we had a frank exchange and debated our respective views .
the money saved could be better invested in european added value , for example , in a smart link between structural funds and transnational networks in the border regions .
i abstained in the final vote , because i consider that the best solution would be for the commission to review its proposal for a directive on the basis of the guidelines which we have given it today .
the new treaty also brings in a competence allowing action to be taken in the area of intellectual property , and this belongs equally to parliament and the council .
it was also my wish for us to work hand in hand with the commission and in particular with its president , because , regardless of the divergences or differences between everyone sitting in this house , everyone is well aware that division between europe 's institutions weakens europe and that the duty of those who assume responsibilities is to work hand in hand .
i would like to know whether you think that it is not leading the european union to contribute to the holding of a debate this weekend on no lesser subject than the europe 2020 strategy , in which , by the way , majority support was generally won for the speeches made in parliament .
who will provide us with healthy , cheap foods in the future ?
i would like to say that the strategy has been designed in line with the objectives and intentions of member states .
in this case , the european food safety authority ( esfa ) has stated , with reference to scientific evidence , that the product is safe .
i would like to stress one point .
at the same time , it was proven that that this specific automobile manufacturer had ultimately agreed to the - albeit partial - disclosure of its letters .
that was one of the arguments presented recently , at a meeting of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs , by mr dick marty from the council of europe .
why have i mentioned this fact ?
the baia mare accident , which occurred in romania 10 years ago , is regarded in the same way as chernobyl , affecting three countries and destroying the ecosystems in the affected rivers over hundreds of kilometres .
mr president , the european citizens ' initiative is one of the major innovations of the lisbon treaty , aimed at increasing direct democracy in the european union .
the risks of the so - called ' live attenuated vaccines ' are no longer a threat , as new inactivated vaccines are now available .
it is also important for germany that the european union continues to develop in a harmonious way , because this brings benefits for germany .
the advantages are self - evident : lower co 2 emissions , less dependence on energy imports from unstable states , growth and employment opportunities , especially in rural areas .
( es ) mr president , commissioner , we are dealing with a reform that is simple but extremely important for the outermost regions .
i must also remind the house that , under article 47 of the interinstitutional agreement , parliament and the council must reach agreement on the funding of bert .
at the moment , far too little emphasis is being put on the fact that measures to protect the environment and the natural world can also create and safeguard jobs .
in order to achieve the aims of the europe 2020 strategy , it will be necessary to link professional training more closely to the demands of the labour market , in order to create new training opportunities for women in the fields of science , mathematics and technology .
the whole country is suffering from a transitional regime which was installed illegally and which is leading that country into anarchy .
in my opinion , it is our moral duty as europeans not only to assume some of the responsibility for research and for seeking new cures , but also to assist poor countries to train health workers and to develop at least a basic healthcare network .
madam president , commissioner barnier , ladies and gentlemen , the largest single market in the world in terms of economic power has developed in the globalised era into a crucial location advantage for the european union .
mr mladenov 's report makes a very important contribution to the ongoing work .
this analysis must be thoroughly documented and made available to the market surveillance authorities on request .
our flagship initiatives are all construed in a way that means that european union - level action complements those actions by the member states .
mrs takkula 's report raises a significant social problem .
i voted in favour of the proposal for a ' single cmo ' regulation since , in view of the serious crisis that the milk sector is experiencing in europe , urgent measures are required to restore market balances and to guarantee an adequate income for farmers , as stated in the objectives of the cap , which were reaffirmed in the treaty of lisbon .
we defend the nobel prize winner shirin ebadi and oppose the recent actions of the authorities and the government campaign , intended to turn public opinion against shirin ebadi .
in comparison to this kind of ambitious scenario that we would like to see , the insistence of parliament on a strong chapter in the fta on sustainable development is absolutely the minimum we need in terms of deciding whether or not this house can give its assent to the upcoming agreement .
council and commission , what solution will europe supply to this lebanese dilemma ?
on behalf of the uen group . - ( pl ) madam president , mr rübig has - as usual - presented an excellent report .
this will also save time and stress for all europeans who need to carry out payments in other countries .
( de ) mr president , at the heart of a policy without any ' - isms ' is credibility .
we have signed a full economic partnership agreement with the caribbean region , whilst we have negotiated interim agreements with countries and regions in africa and the pacific .
i therefore consider it very important that , in this resolution , the impetus is given for us to develop other important criteria alongside the gdp that make it clear what prosperity means and what needs to be done in a region .
i sincerely ask you to please support this compromise .
european institutions are failing spectacularly to understand the nature of the problem .
question hour with the president of the commission
the same thing will be noted in the field of justice .
originally the directive was expected to deal with discrimination against physically disabled and older people .
no one asked them whether they wanted to change nationalities or adopt a new official language .
employers no longer had a choice and women entered the labour market in large numbers .
we need to act at once , before an accident waiting to happen like that in the gulf of mexico comes knocking at our door .
the euro is the currency that has maintained its internal and external stability remarkably well .
for example , in the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs , which i am a member of , we will extend the codecision procedure from 40 to 80 areas of expertise , thereby increasing the democratic legitimacy of eu legislation .
it is imperative that there be a positive outcome to it soon .
it may be painful , but if we do not have these resources , we cannot deal with the great carbon sinks of this world , and they do exist and cannot be explained away .
the independence of investigating bodies is therefore of key importance and i regret that the council fails to grasp this .
soon , common charter flights are going to be sold to us in the same way as car pooling to combat global warming is .
european projects in the crimea are an excellent opportunity to do so , and the same is true in georgia .
that does not make sense in my view , but we are heading in that direction .
yesterday , the newly - elected parliament - and according to all observers the elections to the parliament were pretty honest - elected a new speaker .
i will permit myself to ask two questions .
however , they have unfortunately been living for some years in a terrible situation , which is getting worse , in which their fundamental rights are being violated .
i can therefore only repeat what i said to baroness ashton and to you , commissioner , this morning during the briefing of the steering committee for the working group on delegated acts , which was that i think there is an urgent need to quickly reach a solution in relation to delegated acts , whilst preserving the legal and political responsibility of the legislator and the commission .
in the past week , for example , the conference of presidents discussed an application to circumvent the vote on the staes report .
nevertheless , it must be made clear that a state under the rule of law must be able to ensure its survival by all constitutional means .
mr lópez garrido rightly said that those relations should be based on values , but if this is so , then the union has particular obligations towards defenders of human rights in russia .
the brain drain should be something to be taken seriously .
article 49 is as important , i would argue , to our future as it has been to our past .
let us seek an intelligent compromise .
we need to support them in transforming their facilities and give them time to complete that process , thus preventing farms from suffering irreparable damage and preventing an overnight shortage in the eu market , which will consequently increase prices for consumers .
we have already requested and shall request again tomorrow , via a specific amendment , that parliament vote on the possibility of indicating the origin of raw materials , not only for fresh , non - processed products , but also for processed single - ingredient products ; that is , those in which the characteristic element is substantially the raw material .
pre - commercial procurement also represents an important opportunity for smes .
around 170 000 divorces a year are affected by this proposal , which is around 19 % of the total of some 875 000 divorces a year within the european union .
2 .
all the authorities now need to quickly eliminate the prejudices against fresh vegetables , re - invigorate sales of fresh vegetables and breathe new life into trade with third countries .
mr president , on behalf of the alde group , i wish to propose an oral amendment to amendment 2 .
in writing . - the ecr supported this report because it is a significant improvement on the commission communication and keeps the spirit of previous market - based reforms alive .
the european union owes its success to the gradual raising of economic barriers .
this is that we are coming up with a proposed solution well ahead of time , creating conditions for modernity .
in writing . - ( de ) the dishonesty of the greek government in presenting false information in relation to its budgetary situation has contributed to the current crisis with the euro and the eu .
the crisis for the budget carriers , which could hit us this autumn , will not just affect tourism , it will affect the aviation industry , the financial industry and consequently the entire economy .
in that respect , i think because of biological factors , females have more feelings of sensitivity about others ' pain .
in the last hours there , i sat with a check list .
this is one of those cases .
( pt ) mrs mcguinness , as i said , the council 's assessment is that the application of this regulation , in other words the use of the solidarity fund , has been effective .
the urgency now is to dig out the last survivors - if there are any left - to bury the dead , to feed the living , to distribute water , to treat , to operate and to rebuild .
this is extremely useful for president barroso and myself and ensures that on such occasions we are speaking not just for the brussels institutions , but for the 27 as a whole .
does the commission believe that the registration process will now be adequate , and what steps will it take to make sure that the rest of this agency 's processes work smoothly and effectively ?
one , we must above all take care to ensure that the directive on quality and safety , put forward by the commission , is sufficiently flexible and does not create additional administrative burdens or even a decrease in the number of organs available .
thank you robert .
however , what people usually overlook is the fact that there are still significant problems in turkey with regard to trade union and employee rights .
for example , the council stressed that turkey needs to commit itself unequivocally to good neighbourly relations and to the peaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the united nations charter , having recourse , if necessary , to the international court of justice .
however , we should be aware that more training often does not correspond to more opportunities in the labour market .
we are faced with a question about the philosophy of the eu 's fight against illegal immigration , and - let us put it simply - also against restrictions on legal immigration .
as part of territorial cohesion , integrated , sustainable urban development will be , according to the new treaty , managed jointly by member states and the eu .
as the radical party we propose satyagraha , the search for truth , as a collective global political initiative .
27 .
for this reason , apart from member states ' efforts to become actively involved in promoting policies aimed at making energy consumption more efficient , there must also be coordination at community level in order to achieve much better results .
the distinctive characteristics of production and marketing mean that any downturn in the european automotive industry has an effect on other sectors in every member state .
i am convinced that respect for work includes the idea and the mentality that we can only acquire something if we work for it first .
i therefore wish to greet the members of parliament that are here now attending this sitting , but i also wish to send my greetings to those who may become members of parliament in the future , but who are currently threatened and may be imprisoned .
this is a question that we raised , but to which i have not heard an answer , and i would very much like a good answer to this question .
this one element represents a complete wrong turn for a report that otherwise takes a sound approach , and it is a turn that is morally perilous .
i do not believe that these resources should be subject to conditions which are any stricter than the approved rules and procedures of the european union .
a modern democratic state must be based on the principle of division of power and a balance between the executive , legislative and judicial authorities , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and , in particular , freedom of expression and a legal framework which guarantees women 's rights and gender equality .
we welcome the open attitude president medvedev has taken in discussions with the eu concerning these issues .
there are many people who are unaware of the lisbon strategy .
mr president , the report that we are considering here is a good one .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , beyond the measures that have been announced , i wonder if european policy is doing enough .
the relaxation of the rules of origin offer great opportunities for papua new guinea to promote the local economy .
we cannot allow a committee of experts to have carte blanche and not be accountable ; and so to me this new form of democratic scrutiny is altogether a plus point .
what happened to them ?
fifthly , retailers should not only take this waste back when a new item is purchased ; they should also collect very small volume waste .
they turned to english only in the presence of robert oppenheimer .
we can accuse mr mccreevy of many things , but being overhasty is not one of them .
mr president , as i hear discussions on ways to screw more money out of the little people in the name of climate change , i am struck by two things .
( fr ) madam president , i should like to make it clear straight away that i totally disapprove of the remarks that mrs sinclaire has just made against mrs ashton .
it would have made a great deal of sense to have put both together .
i am confident that , once the new rules come into force , regulation of the feed market will be significantly improved , in the interests of both feed manufacturers and users .
with regard to the ' energy and climate change ' package , a very big effort will be required to sign an agreement by the end of the year .
the ecb annual report 2009 therefore still deals primarily with the ecb 's reaction to the crisis , the exit strategy and governance topics .
without suitable rules against counterfeiting , there is no point talking about measures to relaunch the european economy .
however , i think it is time for us to assess the impact which the economy recovery programme launched by the european commission at the start of the year is having , if any at all , and for us to take a close look at the european union 's budget for this year to see which activities have stopped and what resources we can continue to use to come up with new measures .
the campaign launched against representatives of the mass media and opposition parties , along with the arrest and expulsion of journalists are serious , deplorable actions .
this should also help to reduce the level of error , improve control systems and increase assistance to sub - national authorities and beneficiaries .
however , the proposal provides specific exemptions for certain categories of vessels , in general those under 10 metres , and in particular on the vms , on log book , on prior notification and landing declarations .
things are also going better for the eu than for the united states , for example .
the proposal for a directive on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy - related products is part , along with the two proposals on the energy performance of buildings and the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency , of the energy efficiency package tabled by the commission in november 2008 .
i would like to draw attention to the fact that as this law has been poorly drafted in bad faith , it is creating fresh legal uncertainty because in two days , the slovak ministry of culture has provided three different explanations for some of the articles in the law .
an end to the aggression and the inhumane blockade imposed on the population of the gaza strip !
that is why the french presidency wishes to prepare for this and really to encourage youth mobility and see to it that progress is made in developing voluntary services across europe .
when are you all going to wake up ?
it is essential that member states and partners engaged in the barcelona process emphasise inclusion of the gender perspective in all policies and specific measures which promote equal opportunities for men and women .
on the issue of the climate , we welcome the higher ambitions on the us 's part .
the first concerns impact assessment for legislative proposals .
my last point is about communication in practice . here i want to commend the ombudsman on his new website .
we raised the issue , but these are now merged .
i will conclude , mr president , not to raise your blood pressure any further .
there are some other distinctive points that i particularly wish to stress : in the first instance , voluntary return is promoted ; faster deadlines are set for return in the case of risk of escape or danger posed by the individual and , above all , a fixed timetable is finally laid down for the period for staying in detention centres in order for all the requisite checks to be made .
some have said eur 4 billion , others have said eur 2 billion , and so on .
we are well aware of the real tensions surrounding this heading .
the introduction of a unitary and affordable patent system , albeit only in some eu member states , will play an important role in the furtherance of the single market , particularly by giving the union the boost in innovation and creativity with regard to the creation of goods and services which it so desperately needs .
i am thinking in particular of livestock breeding .
even us president bush , despite his many vacuous remarks before the un assembly , has one point in his favour .
without capabilities we only have documents , and with documents alone we do not solve conflicts .
another example is the support for tobacco production being put in place at the same time as measures to reduce tobacco consumption .
yes , he is very happy to go !
author , on behalf of the uen group . - ( pl ) i wish to propose a stylistic amendment .
i would stress that we can only do what we can .
that is why - and i will conclude on this very practical point - it is very important that many members participate in the hearing that the commission will organise with experts at the beginning of october and in the conference that the french presidency of the european union will hold in paris on 23 and 24 october .
the work of the european union is sometimes seen as rather technical : interesting to specialists , but not relevant to people 's daily lives .
a financial activities tax appears the best way to deal with the issue in the eu .
it is a matter of detail that needs to be clarified .
the success of this policy also depends on the member states , who must use financial measures such as reducing vat , allocating the maximum authorised proportion of european funds to energy performance , and so on .
therefore , i ask everyone to vote responsibly , and to consider a moderate , but definite price increase above the minimum level .
secondly , when the margins diminish at the end of the budget period and , at the same time , new tasks are added , the need for flexibility will also increase .
unfortunately , woefully few member states have invested 3 % of their gdp in research .
some extremely important remarks and comments were made with respect , for example , to whether the accession negotiations have been too long or not .
( the oral amendment was accepted )
in the interests of retaining the eu 's competitive advantage , the launch must not be delayed , otherwise other countries such as china , india and japan will outstrip us .
thirdly , i would like to remind you that this is only the first step .
training plastics engineers now to be unemployed in three years time , to then train a type of financial manager who will be unemployed after four years ; i want to ask the european countries of portugal and estonia a question .
there is a line called ' approximation of standards ' that can be used to call on rural development funding for these extra costs that will certainly be felt by many of the smaller sheep producers .
you and all the members of this parliament have been directly elected by our citizens and the commission has the right and the duty to put european interests above any particular interest .
if we do not stop this conflict , it will bring hatred to europe 's own streets .
i compliment the commission on its undertaking to prevent disorder by facilitating dialogue with member states , international organisations , sports bodies and police forces .
for this reason , the commission considers that , as part of its working programme for 2009 , it will revise and rewrite the legislation relating to people trafficking , exploitation and sexual abuse of children , which is a terrible crime committed mainly against girls .
- before the vote on amendment 3 :
mr president , competition policy is a cornerstone of european legislation .
we know that the eu cannot achieve this alone , as the national governments need to agree to it .
we have no right to be in africa , none whatsoever , whether moral or otherwise .
a situation in which a media magnate at one and the same time both heads the state security service and is a member of the high judicial council , which has the power to appoint and dismiss judges , is not characteristic of a democratic state .
some 98 % of the victims of cluster bombs are civilians .
it is time we finally worked together on a real internal market for rail transport and thus invested in a green and sustainable future .
legislative intervention is desired in this area .
i believe that something similar happened to the barcelona process : it was not finished , but it was abandoned - in part at least .
however , that does not stop us from offering development assistance or humanitarian aid , even when we do not agree with the government or the regime in place .
as members will be aware , initially , catch restrictions were imposed on vessels flying the polish flag .
for this task , we have frontex and eurosur , instruments that bring added value to the work of the member states and reflect the necessary european spirit of cooperation and solidarity .
even before the german and belgian colonisation , the hutus were in the majority in burundi and rwanda and the tutsis were in the minority .
as mr surján said , the available budget is tight - 1 % of gross national product .
it also warns of the speculation on foodstuffs that has been taking place , but limits itself to calling for excessive speculation to be fought and therefore believes that speculation on foodstuffs can continue , provided that it is not excessive .
with its proposal , the commission proposes to extend by 5 years the current requirement for eu countries to have a minimum standard vat rate of 15 % .
however , it is relatively ineffective .
products that are made in a less clean way outside the eu gain a competitive edge in global markets .
( ro ) thank you for the specifications , but i would have liked to have had some additional information .
thus , the acta agreement will leave the existing legal situation in europe almost unchanged .
i am specifically concerned about developing the necessary infrastructure where it does not exist .
i also believe that every european citizen must participate in the battle against climate change , and comprehensive energy - saving campaigns are required to achieve this .
it is an important step forward for the entire european union , but especially for central and eastern europe and the baltic states , that banks cannot abandon their subsidiaries situated in that region but must forward the support they receive .
i rather doubt it .
what if the commission was to think about adopting different approaches ?
the allocation of additional , generous funds in order to build a stable eu neighbourhood seems unavoidable .
this is entirely a question of strategy for our european union , again at a time when currency wars seem on the verge of breaking out .
i can mention here the eastern partnership and black sea synergy .
more nationalism invariably means more wars .
this agreement , although not enough , is a step in the right direction .
eu priorities for the 63rd session of the un general assembly (
on behalf of the commission , i would once again like to thank parliament for its crucial cooperation and its contribution to this report , and i hope , like mr reynders , that we will be able to reach an agreement which is as broad as possible on this compromise , which , in our view , remains a dynamic compromise , and which enables us to maintain one of the commitments made at the g 20 : to learn the lessons of the financial crisis .
i made the original amendment in part with the report on equitable life in mind , but in the context of the financial crisis it has a wider resonance and i have achieved similar inclusions in the capital requirements and credit - rating proposals .
seeking the support of a majority of member states must not be done at the expense of our ultimate goal .
i am particularly pleased that the concept of mixed zones is retained .
this is now changing .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - mr president , my group , the gue / ngl group , considers that the ' made in ' origin marking of products which come from outside the eu is an urgent necessity for the european union .
the parliament celebrates europe day on 9 may .
however , i would like to ask the member states not to attempt to go it alone and i would like to put particular emphasis on this .
only through such a project - based approach , focused on small - scale specific projects , can we overcome the issue of the very diverse and complex interests in the region .
forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see minutes
independence : it has to be clear who provides and who finances the information so that consumers can identify potential conflicts of interest ;
there are three points that need to be made clear in the resolution on the intelligent car .
the group of the greens therefore calls upon you to put this subject on the agenda for the united states / european union summit in early november .
we keep saying we want a system that is independent of the usa , but now boeing is clearly interested in this tender , so that does not seem quite true any more either .
this work is now on the table .
i must also ask you to continue working for passenger information and passenger rights .
the commission , together with the eu member states , is working on an environmental integration strategy to ensure that development cooperation efforts contribute to these objectives .
i think that ecb decisions are generally transparent , based on a good flow of information and open objectives .
according to the case - law of the court of justice on this matter , the member states should maintain their autonomy and legitimacy in regulating the activity of providers of online gambling and gambling games .
the european project is about integration and not about creating enclaves based on ethnic criteria .
in 1989 , when my country finally defeated the communist dictatorship , liu xiaobo was protesting in tiananmen square , demanding exactly the democratic freedoms which were shortly to be enjoyed by almost the whole of europe .
if we have a common fisheries policy , it should be common for all , no exceptions , no exemptions , and the long - term consequences of this are quite serious .
the minutes of the sitting of thursday 22 may 2008 have been distributed .
( nl ) madam president , i voted in favour of the ranner report on the grounds that it offers a good solution to the problem of driving times and rest periods in road transport .
the eu and this parliament need to examine honestly how it approaches such matters in the future .
what role will the commission have in its management and in defining the conditions for its application ?
ladies and gentlemen , in the context of a partnership , is it normal practice for one of the partners to resort to such action ?
consequently , parliament will continue to take its duty to review the performance of the ecb very seriously .
the only politician who knew how to deal with gaddafi was ronald reagan .
serbs , croats and bosnians will have to find their own way .
however , i am firmly opposed to having harmonised soil protection legislation imposed upon all of us , funded by the community , simply because there is no soil protection legislation in some countries .
21 .
everyone knows that britain is worse off than any other country as we go into these hard times .
we can use a carrot and stick policy , but there must be more carrot .
my question to the commission is therefore : in view of the circumstances and bearing in mind that an integrated approach to this issue is needed - in other words , anti - climate change policy cannot be dissociated from civil protection policy - does the commission not think that in these circumstances a directive on fires is justified ?
for me , the choice is simple .
you have to listen to this statement .
that has nothing to do with ireland .
it is important to remember that when we vote on the directive on consumer rights in parliament tomorrow - a directive that we have now been working on for many years .
this is probably correct , because the member states are not in a position to come up with accurate calculations .
therefore , they should be used sparingly and prudently , but there are occasions when they must be used decisively .
but the cohesion policy has the capacity to mobilise regional or local actors across all boundaries in pursuit of european objectives .
there seems to be a lot of confusion arising from the criteria for defining less favourable regions .
however , sometimes , arrangements between schemes in different member states have not worked in practice , and we support the efdi 's efforts to achieve a voluntary model agreement .
who have we made these interim agreements with ?
we may make some small steps forward .
the greatest volume of public procurement from eu funds relates to buildings , where there is often a suspicion - and sometimes more than that - of corruption .
in light of the compromise amendments reached , and given the positive changes made to the substance of the text over recent months , we have decided to withdraw our proposal to reject the texts .
as the agreement supplements , rather than replacing , the existing agreements between several member states and brazil , which cover travel for purposes other than tourism and business or paid activity , there is no reason why it should not be concluded .
first , it aggravates the factors contributing to the organisation 's failures , and there are quite a few of these .
quite frankly , i do not know how to vote in favour or against or abstain .
according to estimates , total vat fraud europe - wide amounts to eur 80-100 billion .
however , the question i wish to ask - and i shall conclude now , mr president - is whether the eu member states are willing to increase resources to meet the growing needs that are emerging in those countries .
madam president , mrs lynne , this is a good stocktake of the lack of social security under which far too many of the citizens in the member states are forced to live .
the decisions that we are to take with regard to the future cannot wait until we have the new multiannual financial framework in place ; we really need to get started on this future - oriented work now , and in this regard 2012 and 2013 will be absolutely crucial .
those states have still not shown that they are capable of countering the lack of coordination and the loss of attractiveness for investment and innovation .
we already have excellent police cooperation in europe and we do not need cepol here .
then secondly , on frontex , minister wallström , what do you actually mean when you talk about strengthening frontex ?
in writing . - ( de ) a pluralist media system is a fundamental prerequisite for the survival of the european model of a democratic society .
mr president , i opposed the joint motion for a resolution on forest fires , despite the fact that i agree with european countries cooperating voluntarily to prevent , fight and repair the appalling damage caused by forest fires .
however , the council 's conclusions have failed to emphasise this priority .
i think that , if you say that there is an absolute ban on asbestos in europe , you have to be consistent with that and allow no exemptions .
we now have a significantly enhanced international framework , in particular , thanks to the adoption , in 2009 , of resolutions 1888 and 1889 .
i believe that we must ensure that battery farming is completely banned by 1 january 2012 .
that is what our citizens are expecting from us .
if we want to come through this crisis with a union that is intact , undamaged and reinvigorated then we must respect our own rules .
they have done a very competent and responsible job and , in so doing , have also been able to keep the budget down at a lower level than i had thought possible at the outset .
why are there so many different examples , which , despite this ' simplification ' , are not meeting with enthusiastic applause ?
instead of calling a spade a spade , the report only ' stresses the importance of ... ' , after the rejection of any concrete figures , benchmarks and deadlines .
turkey 's membership is something which is much further away , and certainly will not happen within the next 10 years .
( nl ) madam president , i have voted in favour of this surprisingly excellent report on frontex , because i can only applaud the appeal made in it for reinforcement of that institution .
the impact of a resolution adopted afterwards will be much weaker .
everyone can benefit from it .
the african union is not taking effective measures to improve the situation in zimbabwe .
i would particularly like to thank mr őry for this .
it provides enough time for them to join our system or to set up an equivalent system .
the specific economic and spatial problems of mountainous regions require supra - national legal regulations to be put in place governing the objectives and principles of pursuing specific mountain policy in member states and , more importantly , they require that a suitable level of financing be ensured for projects and programmes for those regions in particular .
the steady rise in basic food prices is an acute problem which cannot be ignored .
to be specific , it clarifies the roles of the eu in international credit institutions , in the un system , in multilateral security organisations and in other multilateral organisations in general , such as the world trade organisation , the council of europe and the organisation for economic cooperation and development .
i am therefore counting on the member states to launch cooperation initiatives in key areas such as e-health and health technology assessments .
no one is benefiting from the impasse that has been reached in the negotiations with the council , and despite the crisis that europe is undergoing , it is necessary to come to an understanding so that the eu can meet the objectives outlined in the eu 2020 strategy .
there is a huge amount of work ahead of us , and the expectations of our citizens are high ; it is a time for action and delivery .
this is the third report .
the state of our industry is robust , and our flagship , the euro , has indeed steered us through the straits .
i can understand that many politicians prefer to see european fishermen on the west coast of africa rather than in the streets of brussels .
the thinly disguised aim is the monitoring of all remarks under threat of penalty , whether they are made in writing or spoken at meetings .
nevertheless , during the transitional period , non - eu entities will be able to apply national investment rules , whereas eu funds and managers will be subject to the directive , which tends to be stricter .
in this context , this is a case of adopting a regulation that aims to establish harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products . that is , it establishes the rules that the member states must observe in order for their products to come onto the market in the european union .
in writing . - i strongly believe the commission was right to propose amendment of regulation ( ec ) no 1080/2006 on the european regional development fund as regards the eligibility of housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities .
what we need is confidence in the purely commercial nature of their objectives , which means that transparency and corporate governance are the key factors .
( the president cut off the speaker . )
quite the opposite : it asks that we ' avoid creating barriers to the natural course of rivers ' , and indulges in scaremongering about social and environmental problems caused by rivers being diverted .
it was one of the first european institutions and its aim was to establish an international system for free navigation on the danube .
e-commerce is an excellent commercial opportunity for small and medium - sized enterprises and for young entrepreneurs .
15 .
and i must say that with only weeks to go until the copenhagen meeting , it is not responsible to act in such a way that we shall not have a leadership in place for the commission .
so it is important that what we do should also have the backing of neighbouring countries and of the zimbabwean people themselves .
i stand by this issue . i want to see special tariffs for vulnerable customers .
this morning , many members took part in the discussion and i believe that on this occasion , there were many more members involved than usual .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
for the 2011 budget , additional expenditure is required above and beyond the ceilings of headings 1a and 4 .
but as you yourself have said : travailler plus pour gagner plus .
it is difficult to explain to the european public why , for example , the prince of monaco or large multinationals such as heineken and nestlé receive hundreds of thousands of euros in income support in the form of agricultural subsidies merely because they own some land , whilst real farmers often struggle to make ends meet .
2007 discharge : frontex (
in writing . - the cohesion policy and rural development measures come under the same principle of solidarity promoted by the european project and contribute to achieving the objectives of the lisbon strategy .
i welcome improved coordination of economic and fiscal policy in europe , but strongly oppose the short - term vision under which this is being imposed .
in the opinion of the liberals and democrats , turkey must reform its economy and society , politics and constitution irrespective of its accession prospects , in its own interest , in the interests of its people .
we must not therefore be too hasty to legislate and we must take time to consider the laws and adopt a more responsible approach .
if we reopen this debate - a pandora 's box - i can guarantee that there would be no agreement at the end of this year .
in my view , the fact that the heads of state of the member states have not yet resolved to take a common approach can be considered at best misguided , at worst a failure .
while the european parliament is discussing how children can be better protected , the islamic world is moving in the opposite direction .
the two non - negotiable conditions set by the commission were fully respected .
the broad subjective and objective scope of the regulation is justified by the frighteningly low rate of obtention of maintenance payments in certain eu member states .
therefore , i would kindly ask the commissioner to seriously consider this matter and come up with a viable solution as soon as possible .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on industry , research and energy . - ( hu ) thank you for the floor , madam president .
that is really sad , mr president , but it is we who are then going to be subject to accusations of being populist .
i have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to rule 103(2 ) of the rules of procedure .
vice - president of the commission / high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy . - madam president , i want to begin by honouring the memory of richard holbrooke , a dedicated diplomat , a champion of peace and a man i was proud to call my friend .
unfortunately , i cannot give you an answer , because i can no longer remember myself what the group chair said at midday today .
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - mr president , we are here today to prevent a potential , large - scale , human tragedy from taking place .
this is where fierce opposition is frequently met from politicians , institutions and public opinion .
this europe really is the europe of nation states .
consequently , the agreement has been suspended , and no data is being transferred .
12 .
i especially hope that our energies can then be better used for and directed at the europe of results , of which the commission president spoke and has always spoken .
he , as a person with a disability , working from home , would be ideal to start up a new business .
we can inspire member states to make more intelligent use of the funds and to coordinate this with unhcr .
vice - president of the commission . - mr president , the comitology reform that was decided in july 2006 introduced a ' regulatory procedure with scrutiny ' , which gives a veto right to the european parliament on measures of general scope that amend a basic legal act adopted under codecision .
here again , life is not considered at its true value , but as a mere utilitarian function .
as regards the specific situation of older people , ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities , the council has already adopted legislation aiming to protect these and other vulnerable groups from discrimination .
i voted for discharge in respect of the european union general budget for the financial year 2006 and the report by mr jørgensen , which recommends granting discharge to the commission .
i was also pleased by the very frequent references to the new beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy .
( for the results and other details of the vote : see minutes )
however , this is not to say that the improvements made have had no effect on the current directive , and , in fact , it is to be welcomed that no upfront payments have to be made until the end of the cooling - off period .
russia is not an ally of europe with whom we share values ; it is a neighbour with whom we share a geographical area , divergences and common interests , such as the situation in afghanistan .
we are given a mandate by those citizens to respect and to make others respect the fundamental treaties of the european union , which protect the rights of their citizens .
moreover the possibility is of course envisaged of changing supplier at any time and also of being promptly and regularly informed of prices set by suppliers .
do with it what you will .
some of the other languages contain mistakes , so please follow the german text .
however , it is equally important to ensure that these financial resources are being correctly deployed , in other words that they are having the desired effect .
therefore , i would rather listen to the professionals - like the farmer , the keeper of 30 000 happy eu - compliant hens , that i visited in my constituency last month .
accession of bulgaria and romania to the convention on driving disqualifications ( vote )
also foreseen is an ' impact assessment ' in 2008 , to precede the action plan for 2009-2012 , on the basis of a clear timetable .
i was not in favour of basing this joint project in europe as the host pays a disproportionate part of the total budget .
the second issue specific to romania is the continuation , obviously on a much smaller scale , of transhumance , a practice which should be treated , in my view , as a separate issue in itself and preserved as far as possible .
the aim of the measures is to revamp the rail sector by removing hindrances to the operation of trains on the european rail network .
this is not a good directive .
this factor is particularly worrying as the eu is at present preparing to launch the eastern partnership .
a public consultation on an issues paper was launched on 16 november and will close in early january .
to avoid the disaster of asymmetrical adjustments , we urgently need dialogue and collective action .
we will review the text to take into account legitimate concerns .
that covers all the points relevant to the internal market .
that is also why the commission welcomes the european space agency 's intention to develop an instrument to that end , called space situational awareness , that can not only verify the observance of the relevant agreements but also monitor the security of our satellites .
however , by the same token , i do not think it is appropriate for us to use such cases , which we are not always very familiar with , as a pretext for internal political struggle .
compared with other places , there is no right to health that can be exercised to the same extent in bulgaria or romania , so it is evident that this resolution , with all its complications , can be a useful point of reference .
minimum standards for the protection of calves ( codified version ) ( vote )
the interim agreements will be replaced with full epas that include similar provisions before any substantive liberalisation commitments apply on the acp side .
this involves the sustainable extraction of raw materials , sustainable transport , conditions for scientific research , the protection of nature and , last but not least , the rights of the indigenous inhabitants .
we will be open about this , but , at the same time , the council is considering a possible relaxation of certain sanctions , particularly the visa restrictions imposed on some belarus officials affected by the sanctions .
these are countries which joined the union only recently and which are outside the euro area .
there is obviously always the possibility of there being complex difficulties in these relations , and there can also be disagreements , but the relationship between the european union and russia is a broad and multifaceted one .
we wish them success in their fight for religious tolerance , for which this country was and still is a shining example , and it is something that , as partners who can speak openly on matters to do with human rights , we must preserve in egypt , tunisia and malaysia .
this is a crucial task , but the imf 's role , beyond stabilising the markets , is also to help correct the global imbalances that caused this crisis .
we met again in paris on 13 and 14 july .
i know that one of the major events in 2006 - if i am not mistaken - took place in vienna , and the outcome of that conference was very inspiring for our work .
( de ) mr vondra , it is always being said that agricultural policy is there for only the 3 % who farm , but there are 100 % of us who eat .
we need to do that in the future , but what i expect is direct budget aid given to egypt as fast as possible , because by the end of the year , they will have no money in their budget and that could be the beginning of a counter - revolution in egypt .
we also want the campaigns to be free and fair , and that all parties have an equal chance to have their say .
we note that morocco is going to launch an investigation , but we resolutely believe and we demand that there should be an international inquiry to shed light on events .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to refer back to a passage of commissioner de gucht 's speech on international development cooperation .
ironically , these fraudulent companies quote eu law in order to intimidate their targets further .
conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures (
i would like to congratulate mrs járóka and also mrs kinga göncz , and i welcome the commitment of the council and the commission .
it is of paramount importance , since this package really is the cornerstone of our comprehensive response to the crisis that is still ongoing .
we know that illegal immigration can decrease the gdp of several countries by up to 20 % , whilst their economic growth is limited by the reduction in the number of skilled workers .
his proposal increases legal certainty and removes unjustifiably stringent requirements in order to reduce companies ' administrative burdens by 25 % by 2012 .
whichever member state you look at , that represents the large majority of businesses .
that is the key to this strategy and it depends on us , on the member states and on our common political will .
the aim of the programme is not , of course , to criminalise the internet in a catastrophic vision of new technologies ; quite the contrary .
such understanding of voluntary activity also means that the volunteer , who is often also a benefactor , must not suffer any material penalty when helping others and offering them gifts .
i can give another example .
madam president , climate change can no longer be viewed rigidly in environmental terms , but must instead be mainstreamed as a cross - cutting concept through varying policy areas , including development and human rights .
yesterday , there was a meeting of the conference of presidents , and also a meeting of the bureau .
the message we wish to send to the council is this : shoulder your responsibilities , present a united front ; what we need is not a gesture but a coherent long - term policy .
but it will formulate the principles ensuring equal treatment of smes , and bring in the initial framework of a policy aimed at enterprises .
they operate within the internal market and should be able to enjoy the measures to the same extent , and not just at national level .
the winter olympics in sochi also have to re - examined ; there cannot be an olympic truce .
serbia 's full integration into the european union is in the interest of european stability and security .
it would mean that there is a suspicion of fraud in this case , because i know that olaf can only carry out investigations in the case of suspected fraud .
( fr ) mr president , minister , madam vice - president of the european commission , my question concerns the application of the treaty of lisbon , especially the promise made to the irish people to have one commissioner per country .
commissioner , i would like you to inform us of your position on this matter , either today or later on .
of course this is one of the things that the asylum support office will be looking at : how to pull together that information from a variety of sources in a more standard format and perhaps a format where people will have greater confidence that the information is not being used politically .
something i would like to do during the european football championships - which are not long away now and which will be hosted in poland and ukraine - is to watch one or two matches with you .
so the measures in place so far are not adequate .
it is not enough for europe to make statements and resolutions .
i am proud that , in geneva , we see that europe is a champion of human rights and , with the work due to start in june this year , our resolution today says that we should be a champion of further reform of the human rights council itself .
but i shall use this opportunity to start at the personal level .
we need to involve more women in vocational training , the sciences and educational fields that have been until now considered as ' masculine ' .
my colleague , mrs lynne , with her sensitive approach to social issues , and all of us with our amendments , have been involved in all the omc actions included in the national action plans .
it is more than natural that i say a word about georgia .
i could give you a list of the products imported , but i have only one minute so i cannot do so on this occasion .
let me now turn to a second point : the legal expenses , which are very important for the consumers and for insurers as well .
this is also in the interest of municipalities , which are often harmed by the negative impacts of transit traffic in particular .
madam president , i voted against the resolution establishing a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone , because in ireland and greece , we see the reality that such mechanisms are to bail out a crisis - ridden financial system dominated by speculators and assorted profit - seeking sharks at the expense of working people , pensioners and the poor .
( the president cut off the speaker )
we must oppose the lobbyist and , at times , corrupt division of europe , and must not condone russia 's arrogance towards us , by which i mean the european parliament .
yes - countries have made improvements , and that is to be welcomed , but overall road deaths are still too high and the eu will not , on current trends , achieve its road death reduction targets .
it is right to have talked about it this morning and made our expectations known to the member states .
however , one of the most important causes of death among mothers is hazardously performed abortions .
for this reason , i think we should take one step at a time .
negotiations on the eu - moldova association agreement (
when we in the eurogroup agree that member states that have achieved their medium - term financial target can now also act on the current economic downturn and rising oil and food prices , they can only do that because they have in the past worked out the budgetary margins that are necessary , so that they are not weakened and incapable of reacting in times of crisis .
a week ago , the largest mass grave in latin america was discovered in colombia .
they are , of course , to improve the quality of bodies of surface water .
it must remain a strong , well - financed policy , and one that is a genuine lever of economic development for all our regions .
this was a statement adopted by the european council , not a conclusion .
costly but sham security does no one any favours .
state of european asylum system , after the recent decision of the european court of human rights ( debate )
i think it is absolutely despicable the way the president is behaving .
i wanted to say that right at the start before i come to my points of criticism .
1 .
however , all that remains fragile and at the mercy of the counterfeiting and technological advances of emerging countries , which are too often financed by the capital of european firms .
the european commission was quick to react to the economic and financial crisis , and competition policy measures were adapted effectively .
however , services are a key source of growth and employment .
these positive trends have been quickly reversed , however , in a country where terror is spreading .
the uk has been politically taken over .
without social progress , economic progress will run out of steam sooner or later .
a diplomacy of deeds and not just words .
opening frontiers to third - country workers is necessary , but our top priority should be to lift the eu 's internal barriers first .
mr barroso and mr van rompuy , tell me this morning - because you have not done so yet - about the morality of transferring tens of billions of euro of private bad debts by speculators and bankers gambled wildly on the irish property market and placing those debts on the shoulders of the irish people who carry no responsibility whatsoever for them .
the retabling of the amendments ( amendments 7 , 17 , 49 ) on hazardous substances is important for future health and safety and transparency .
it will be necessary to address issues which have surfaced recently , such as the subprime crisis and fuel and food prices , but when we do so we must bear in mind that the our circumstances are sounder , that next year we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the euro and that we must strengthen international economic cooperation .
for what we need is a broader plan of action , a better strategy which , apart from the sea itself , will include its drainage area , which currently , as we all know , is suffering severe flooding .
the european union should indeed ensure thoroughly the respect of its high standards when importing goods from countries with lesser quality production standards like china .
other countries have railways and possibly motorail trains , but our three baltic states do not have this yet .
some people argue that it is a resolution on regional policy rather than on fisheries .
sweden is in a very exclusive club , almost alone at 1 % of gni when it comes to development assistance .
this is a step in the right direction , provided that these instruments are implemented effectively .
instead , what is really needed is joined - up reasoning and realism : today , our priority is giving work to our citizens !
it is absolutely indispensable that we have a competitive patent system .
we must not forget that if the european workforce is affected by alcohol , it will not be very competitive in a global world .
obviously , we have a lot of work to do to educate adults about the dangers for children .
( cs ) this necessary proposal for revising the directive on late payments , which we have been discussing today , is decidedly better than the original proposal .
fairness is also important at the level of the citizen .
most importantly , our consumers do not feel safe because they do not know the rules and , in many cases , the compensation mechanisms are not working in the way they should .
in the united states , there are places where starting a business takes 10 minutes .
we must , therefore , start with the basics : budgetary orthodoxy .
this limit , in most eu member states , is 100 km / h on the motorway , and 50 km / h in built - up areas .
this does not alter the reality of the problem you have pointed out .
this is a matter of fundamental security and the future of cooperation of eu member states with countries which , in the future , will perhaps also be member states of the union .
fourth , we need to fully prepare our pension systems for the acceleration of population ageing .
6 .
madam president , i wish to commend the rapporteur on his work .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i too would like to congratulate mr kirilov on the excellent work he has carried out in a field full of difficulties , but also opportunities , such as that of relations between eu countries and the countries of the south caucasus .
yet we react critically to the council 's first proposal and assess it critically , and we are ready to discuss kosovo and palestine in the short term and also to discuss and take decisions on the proposals on the galileo programme and the european institute of technology on around the 19th and will try to come to a mutual understanding on these important issues .
eu policy should hold the russian authorities responsible for their collusion with criminal elements .
i firmly believe that romania 's maritime border , for instance , is incomparably better protected than similar borders for other schengen member states .
on the other hand , there is insufficient support for economic initiatives and female entrepreneurship .
this ini report intends to set out the position of parliament as regards the legislative package on economic policy coordination ( six proposals , including four under codecision ) released by the commission two weeks earlier .
the greatest benefit will be transparency , which will offer a great deal of help in giving the public a proper breakdown of the price of an air ticket . the citizens of the union will have their trust in the eu reinforced and at the same time the principle of subsidiarity will not be compromised as a result .
the iascf and the iasb have over recent years implemented significant reforms of their internal procedures but i cannot deny that further improvements are necessary .
i am speaking under rule 150 of the rules of procedure .
the epas cannot amount to mere free trade agreements under the auspices of the wto , nor can they jeopardise the already fragile economies of our overseas communities .
here is a case which is being handed to you on a plate .
the process of ratification of the constitutional treaty was wrecked due to unsuccessful referenda in france and the netherlands .
the negative message at the bucharest nato summit , where the petty - minded and illogical behaviour of greece played a major role , was unfortunate .
i have participated in other debates where there were perhaps one , two or three speakers and we share the time .
it also enabled productivity to be increased whilst retaining social harmony .
i would like to thank mr bösch , not only for his praise of our rapporteur , but also for his fairness and help .
the first view , advocated by the former us president george w. bush , is that accession is very desirable as turkey can supply a lot of cheap labour and soldiers and is a loyal nato member .
on 1 october 2008 , only 1.7 % of transactions were made by way of the sepa credit transfer format .
i am thinking for example of the fisheries policy , which has to cope with the consequences of the increase in diesel prices .
when i say ' actual ' , this means that it will eventually be necessary , one day , to raise the issue of derogations and emissions trading .
her murderers have still not been brought to justice .
on behalf of the pse group . - mr president , i thank the commissioner and mr vondra , for the council , for their explanation , but i am certain they felt that there is still some hesitation on our part in giving them our full support .
the points of view of all concerned , and of course the proposals from the european institutions , will provide valuable input into the forthcoming action plan on urban mobility , which i intend to present this coming autumn .
this is the theorem that should appear on the frontispiece of the ' governance ' package .
in my opinion , it means two things : firstly , that we must reconsider the ' three times twenty ' objectives ; and secondly , that we must reconsider the timetable , that is to say , the end of the year .
in addition , the law grants custody of children only to the father and grandfather .
in other words , there is still a real need for economic change , and the partnership agreements can and must be used for that purpose .
it is an open secret that the data presented at the time by the european commission regarding the effects of such a change came from the advertising materials of the producers of these new - technology light bulbs , and there is a great deal of evidence to indicate that this was the case .
unilateral ambition is not ambition : only when we act together according to the same rules will it be easy to tighten our belts substantially .
we are quite convinced that there will also be some convictions , but in some national judiciaries it takes a very long time .
on that basis , the commission will examine the situation carefully and will report on this in the visa reciprocity report that will be issued , probably , in september 2009 .
however , i regret that there is still unfair competition in the energy market and i support the invitation made to the european commission in the document put to the vote today to monitor closely the implementation by the member states of the third energy liberalisation package .
joint tourist trails and the development of transport , the environment and contacts between universities will be high - visibility projects and will create an image for the danube strategy .
at the same time , the commission will have to justify thoroughly to them its possible negative stance .
as a result , defence markets were not opened up , which impacted negatively on all eu member states .
on ' legislative procedure and planning : mutual cooperation ' it includes improving the involvement of parliament , the review of all pending proposals at the beginning of a new commission 's term of office , taking due account of the views of the parliament , and the commitment by the commission to report on the concrete follow - up to any legislative initiative requests pursuant to article 225 tfeu .
on this subject , let us be quite clear : this was an infamous battle , and i am quite sure that everyone has reason to be dissatisfied .
multi - country responses can be very effective but can result in divergence rather than the cohesion which we wish for under the european idea .
this is a commonly held and broad - based concern .
things have taken place in this period of time - probably not fundamental enough to change the content of the strategy - but they complement the issues from this period .
frankly , i was elected by this parliament , by secret vote , so i think i deserve the respect of this parliament , from all members of the parliament .
the committee on agriculture proposed that the committee on budgets revise the estimated expenditure , which it did .
the most important element in the report , in my view , is the clear commitment to europe 's citizens that we will leave quotas - in other words , the task of determining how many people enter the labour market - up to the member states , just as before .
what can the eu do ?
it is no coincidence that 95 % of european citizens believe in the importance of protecting our environment .
i also want to use this opportunity to call on the united states not to sign , at present , the treaties on the installation of their anti - missile shield elements in europe .
we need to pay our monetary debt and that also means investing in these countries , both in order to adapt them and to combat climate change and to pay off our debt that has accumulated from our unfair common agricultural policy .
the adoption of mr zahradil 's proposal has reopened the debate on the importance of origin marking for products from third countries , as a measure designed to implement a trade policy that can prevent market disturbances due to a rise in foreign imports , and to sort out the complicated legislative environment that today makes it difficult for small and medium - sized enterprises to develop .
- mr president , just a week before the european council , we asked the council , here in the european parliament , to agree on clear guidelines and concrete measures towards safeguarding employment and creating new job opportunities .
no contract , no agreement , no society can be sustainable without justice .
in writing . - ( it ) i am voting for this measure .
they should be regarded as a specifically vulnerable group , an exposure group in their own right , and a small step has been taken today in order to do that , in the vote that we have just had in this parliament .
in the european union , we have a european commission elected by you as the elected representatives of the citizens of europe , and this is democracy .
( ro ) we must ask ourselves what direction we want our education and research systems to go in .
it is important for every agreement to relax or eliminate restrictions on market access and investment opportunities , to maintain and enhance social and environmental standards , to provide adequate safeguards for data protection and privacy , to include mutual recognition of security standards and ensure a high level of passenger rights .
eu research ministers set up a long - term public - private partnership in february with the aim of getting hydrogen and fuel - cell technology ready for the market between 2015 and 2025 .
mr president , commissioner , the existing arrangements in the event of an accident involving radioactive contamination are totally out of touch with the current institutional situation .
after the need for food and clothing , the need for housing is a basic human need , after all , and for that reason , housing is one of the social public goods , and preventing homelessness is a social challenge .
priority must be given to abolition of the death penalty .
it will be easier to carry out investigations and bring charges .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for this broad debate which has centred on some excellent resolutions tabled by the european parliament , and may i congratulate the authors mr swoboda , mr thaler and mrs oomen - ruijten .
the council declared that acp countries and regions , if they so wished , could depart where necessary from the provisions agreed by other countries or regions during epa negotiations .
in fact , what i see today is that the americans are coming closer to what have been traditionally european positions .
any effort , then , to improve the work of this parliament 's plenary sessions , on the basis of certain principles , is always welcome : firstly , the principle of efficiency , so that we hold discussions in order to arrive at options and finally decisions ; secondly , the principle of democracy , a level playing field for all , regardless of the power they wield , so that everyone gets a hearing ; and thirdly , the principle of ' vitality ' , i would call it , so that what we say is of interest to the public .
i therefore voted against the report .
i think we must be very clear today . we are guilty of failing in our legal duty to rescue .
the equipment used to scan the sheep is not accurate .
one of the key principles on which the european union is founded is that of solidarity .
the progressive opening up of their markets , based on the principle of differential treatment , may contribute to the transfer of technology and know - how and to an improvement in their infrastructures .
however , we must be totally realistic and propose specific working instruments which will allow the correlation of innovation efforts at european , national and regional level .
finally , work should begin on radically reforming international economic institutions , as called for recently by president lula in his address to the united nations .
these are all members we never saw when we were doing the actual groundwork in order to steer the capital in the right direction .
the report recognises and praises the work done by the ecb in managing the crisis .
it might therefore be more appropriate to ask the commission to undertake an impact assessment to examine how the legislation has worked and been received , rather than calling for even more stringent implementation .
the presidency has also launched an initiative to establish a platform of european memory and conscience , with the aim of raising public awareness about european history and the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes .
with reference to the subject of urban environmental health , and particularly the quality of indoor air , the commission should do more to combat domestic pollution , given that europeans spend on average 90 % of their time inside buildings .
at the same time , the government is not putting forward any short - term or long - term solution .
as regards the fukushima power station , european unease is legitimate .
lucky animals , because this resolution also shows that they are in some cases better protected than man .
such moves away from democratic principles tarnish the european union 's image as a whole .
yet , baroness ashton , even successful elections do not make a democracy , nor do they make a state under the rule of law .
i would also like it to remain that way .
monitoring of compliance with eu environmental , social and procurement standards has also come in for criticism from ngos .
there is a special high - calibre , independent identification committee which is now preparing criteria .
this is a positive obligation resulting from the european convention on human rights .
perhaps .
it is indeed high time for the ' e ' in the emu to be infused with life through the creation of a real and effective economic union as the final step in european economic policy integration .
will they murder her too ?
this means that during working hours , postal workers , fire fighters and police officers whose mother tongue is hungarian are not allowed to use their own language .
this year , only 11 % of the eur 500 million available was requested .
in the same train of thought , i believe that the two projects , nabucco and south stream , must be taken into consideration , along with other solutions .
the netherlands has made an application for egf funds for redundancies in the automotive sector , which are in line with the fund 's regulation .
let us now defend the christian minority and other religious minorities in pakistan although , of course , this is not the only problem facing a country troubled by serious political conflicts and which , unfortunately , faces the prospect of destabilisation .
this shows that , in the face of the crisis , within this institution of the european parliament , when political goodwill is present , high - quality political instruments are made available to our fellow citizens .
it poses a health risk because the process of bonding together various scraps of meat significantly increases the surface area of the foodstuff , which might have been contaminated by bacteria .
i would like to offer my very warm thanks to mr rehn for his courage .
ecvet could be a valuable instrument for adapting vocational training and education to the demands of the labour market , on condition , however , that it take into account specific national and regional circumstances .
it is particularly important that fathers are included in bringing up children .
in summing up the belgian presidency , we should , first of all , appreciate its highly active role in designing the european financial stability system .
this suspension will help to strengthen the competitiveness of local economic operators and will contribute to creating and maintaining jobs in the outermost regions , acting as a counterbalance to the economic disadvantages arising from their geographical location , without affecting the consolidation of the internal market or the principle of free competition within the eu .
i would like to welcome you to the gallery .
it creates negative pressures on the wages of legally resident workers and distortion of competition between companies that comply with employment legislation and those who flaunt it .
this figure is also just over a quarter of the amount granted to italy , one of the main eib shareholders .
i voted in favour of this report as i agree that a coherent and transparent framework must be established for multilateral surveillance of macro - economic developments in the union and in the member states .
a vote for this package is a vote for consumer confidence in holiday products , for clear consumer information , and for a competitive and responsible holiday industry .
this is a crucial issue for democracy and i think that the president of parliament should defend it .
we can also , when this is required by our security needs , invest outside the borders of the eu .
mr president , ' let us not allow fear to guide us ' , we often say .
however , i believe that we have actually covered this in some ways , because we have not simply listed our criticisms of everyone , we have talked about us , about how we use - for better or for worse - the instruments available , and respect for eu law .
another issue of high priority is , of course , the financial and economic crisis .
on the third question on priorities , you are absolutely right . everybody is discussing this .
the greek communist party is categorically opposed to the stockholm programme , just as it was opposed to previous programmes to implement the misleadingly entitled area of freedom , security and justice .
thank you for your attention .
we have several european programmes that provide incentives .
i must say that i was very disappointed because we had a public workshop on this and not a single parliamentarian turned up to participate in the workshop .
for that reason , the commission created a test phase for micro - credits with an instrument called jasmine - also financed from european structural funds , and because this was so successful , a new instrument is intended to follow in its wake .
for this reason , the commission will have to create a transparent procedure , so that its acceptance by industry and by the member states can be assured , for we are dealing with very large sums here .
finally , madam president , i would therefore like to make a personal appeal to the european commission to show the same drive that is now being exhibited in respect of cereals in other sectors too , as and when necessary .
i would urge the commission to take its time and represent the eu countries ' interests fairly .
to date , the common agricultural policy has focused principally on food quality , food safety and competitiveness , but it has been less involved in rural development outside of the area of agriculture .
there is cross - party concern that the current restrictions imposed by the european commission are disproportionately costly and disruptive .
this is why we rejected them .
however , it is likewise not in our interest for the us to institute a policy that would favour its motor industry at the expense of competitors from other parts of the world .
as we await the so - called ' health check ' on the cap , it is important that we deal with this issue now , to get it out of the way , as it were .
the memorandum goes on to insist on cuts in social welfare , the roll - back of key public services , and reductions in public sector employment and public sector pensions .
at this stage , let me pay tribute to two organisations in particular .
i call on the commission to submit measures for a european scrapping scheme as quickly as possible .
in this regard , we must also make it clear that private investments are necessary , because the situation will be impossible without them .
we are making progress , and the staes report shows this very clearly .
we currently have a debate ongoing about flexicurity .
for this reason , i do not think that the quota system ought to be frozen in all member states , but each state ought to decide how to set their own quotas .
i believe that , at the time of the tenth anniversary of the launch of this policy , the proposals made in the danjean report are extremely important in terms of improving the eu 's actions , which will certainly contribute to the security of european citizens and , ultimately , to peace and international security .
proposals for deepening the single market , whether they are about removing the administrative barriers faced by small enterprises or stimulating e-commerce , must be for the benefit of the citizens .
never before has china received so many expressions of solidarity and offers of tangible support because , this time , the chinese authorities have not tried to hide the scale of the tragedy .
last , but not least , i agree with most of you who were arguing for the need for a more strategic approach , the need for medium - and long - term solutions - this is exactly what the czech presidency is planning to do .
i also welcome the change that clarifies further the interplay between the regulation on enzymes and the gm food and feed legislation .
when the majority of the european parliament gets into the details , it is exactly the opposite ; nothing can in fact be left to the member states .
the government of romania cannot intervene in any way .
we do not impose any sanctions - or next to no sanctions - on turkey .
the rapporteur rightly notes that radioactive substances may continue to have an impact for a great many years , and the overriding aim should always be to protect human life and health .
i would like to ask you quite openly : is it not the case that discrimination against the roma is also one of the reasons why the community has not made use of such eu funds to date ?
here , we value and protect each and every life ; we severely punish anybody who endangers human life ; and the punishment is more severe if attacks on life are against any minority and motivated by hate .
i am sorry about the long answer but the details were also substantial .
i voted for both casini reports and i look forward to the strongest possible proposals from the european parliament 's working group on the transparency and regulation of lobbying activities .
by evaluating the work of the prosecutor in advance , before the end of the investigation , we prevent justice from being implemented .
nowadays in europe , economically viable agriculture is a requirement for ensuring food security for its population .
for me or any other ordinary citizen to be able to travel abroad , i need a carta de libertad , that is a freedom card , just as the slaves did : only today it is called a carta blanca , a white card .
i would also like to praise the european union 's considerable achievements in supporting the convention .
according to one survey , during the first quarter of 2009 there were three times as many redundancies recorded as new jobs created across the european union .
in recent years , the countries of eastern europe have been told that they should privatise their banks , in other words , that they should subordinate them to western european banks .
second , the directive offers only a partial answer to the question of who will pay for all this .
this would not necessarily need to involve long - distance travel , but , for example , could be organised by setting foot and meeting people at your local church , mosque , synagogue , temple or other places of worship .
without doubt , the increased powers granted to the european parliament under the treaty of lisbon enhance the role of the european parliament considerably and formulate tangible and effective responses to the expectations of european citizens .
the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction ( emcdda ) plays a vital role in collecting data about drugs and drug addiction , adding to the store of objective , reliable and comparable data at european level , which provides a basis for analysing demand for drugs and ways of reducing it , as well as phenomena associated with the drug market in general .
firstly , changes in duties at european union level should encourage an increase in the production and distribution of goods and services , mainly by reducing red tape , but also by making it easier for national administrations to apply control procedures based on risk analysis .
( pt ) mr president , it is true that this proposal for a directive discusses a wide variety of situations , including , for example , immigrant workers from third countries , seasonal workers and posted workers , but the truth is that what this represents in practice is the legalisation of social dumping , the reinforcing of job insecurity and the worsening of discrimination , under the pretext of a single regulation .
i also call for the strategies to be reconsidered , and for the techniques used by this operation in the indian ocean to be reviewed urgently , along with how it is present there .
we regret that the proposals made by my group were rejected , particularly the definition of a limited set of general rules common to all vertical consumer protection instruments : this would ensure a high level of consumer protection with implementation of the approved method of minimum harmonisation combined with the country of destination principle , so as not to compromise existing national legislation .
for me , the future and the way the conflict in nagorno - karabakh is handled are a litmus test of what the sides want to show on european matters and how they demonstrate their credibility in this area .
however , it is also about another issue . it is about the direction of europe as a whole and that is not your decision alone .
as a result , they should stop claiming that they can preach to the rest of the world .
human rights are not negotiable and i hope that a majority of this house will also vote in favour of these common european human rights in our amendment .
we are about to begin a rather special vote , since , for all those who , like me , are due to leave parliament , i think that this final moment spent together will be somewhat emotional .
secondly , we have had a debate on ' flexicurity ' for a number of years which has also produced good guidelines in the council , but this has not been reflected in the integrated guidelines .
together we are strong .
( sk ) the lisbon treaty , which has strengthened the powers of the eu in the field of energy policy , should be actively exploited in order to overcome difficulties and prevent possible problems on the energy market .
this also means , however , that we have to take greater account of the gender aspect in all eu support programmes - whether for the development of rural areas , the social fund and the like - and make the programmes contingent upon how they continue to be used .
the current system of domain names and registrations works brilliantly .
you also raised the question of subsidiarity , and wondered whether a european initiative was needed .
he has not done anything criminal whatsoever ; he has acted entirely in accordance with the law and the constitution .
there is something else we have sought to do , and this is also something that concerns the european public .
this is very important because it means that you can swap bad bonds from countries in difficulties with the rescue mechanism 's aaa bonds .
i would like to appeal to you , mrs ashton , to ensure that the huge amount of aid which is going to the palestinian authority is not used by israel 's enemies for attacks on what is , at present , the only democracy in the region .
first , ratings are taken into account in banking regulations in order to determine the amounts of own funds that will be used to back investments .
the commission must also make vigorous efforts to prevent the social exclusion that is currently taking place around europe and to strengthen the parties of the labour market .
we currently import almost 50 % and in 10 years ' time , if we do nothing , it will be 70 % .
i would like to stress that the treatment of third countries can be viewed in two different ways , depending on whether one is inside or outside the european union .
the first is to divide farmers into large and small and destroy their unity in the trade unions .
i must say , it upsets me to have to openly state the fact - the fact that a child and his father who died on the seine should receive different protection from what would apply if they had died on the open seas .
the citizens and institutions of all eu member states should be keen for the best and the strongest candidates to become commissioners .
i believe that it would be useful for parliament to take a stand on this issue .
i find it truly bizarre how quickly this pro - european spirit has been lost .
it is therefore extremely important for us to take all possible measures aimed at overcoming the demographic crisis in europe .
this is the case even though the commission is aware that turkey is making nowhere near the required amount of progress in respect of the accession criteria .
those of you who know me will be aware of just how committed i am to this matter .
i know they are not covered by the scope of this proposal , but many of northern ireland 's farmers feel let down when they work hard to meet the requirements laid down by europe , and then have to compete with those who do not have to meet the same standards .
i was very happy with your answer .
the european parliament 's attitude to the future cooperation is important , particularly in view of the greater role that parliament will have as a result of the treaty of lisbon .
the aim is to provide maximum security for union citizens in all member states .
i would particularly like to thank mr casaca , with whom i had the honour of working on the discharge of parliament for the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats .
this would be a good addition to the treaty .
let us hope that this determination holds firm under the pressures of the next two or three days .
i welcome the adoption of this proposal , which , as well as creating a programme of pilot studies to be carried out by the member states , will include data on rural tourism and green tourism , which cover over 50 000 lodgings , the overwhelming majority of which are managed by smes .
this means the crisis has ruined the efforts which have been made over many years to promote employment .
people talk about having more time for legislative work .
and we have a new president of europe , herman van rompuy .
but at least there is a theoretical possibility that within two years we will have a wider front than only one quarter of the emitters .
it is therefore not enough to tackle the employers .
( es ) mr president , commissioner , i should like to begin by quoting word - for - word from your document presenting the renewed social agenda .
we are also extending rapex - china , which is very important .
the next item is the five draft resolutions on china : minority rights and use of the death penalty .
( fr ) mr president , our discerning and determined position is eagerly awaited .
i too support reducing carbon emissions in europe and in the world , but not at any price .
if we europeans are not going to take measures now to promote a common immigration policy , we will suffer the consequences later of not having done it on time .
in order to achieve this , we would like to suggest that progress be made on two very important points .
in the opinion of the commission , where does community competence as regards the organisation of public services begin and where does it end ?
it is also an expression of the agreements between the social partners .
it acknowledges that , since both the causes of discards and the measures needed to reduce them vary from fishery to fishery , no single solution will work throughout the community .
ladies and gentlemen , i have just heard that two spanish soldiers have been killed by a mine in afghanistan and others - also spanish - have been seriously injured .
this would not surprise me , because we cannot achieve a change in this way .
furthermore , the ess report recognises that without development and poverty eradication , there will be no sustainable peace .
i repeat that we will also support any initiative that promotes dialogue between all the parties .
with this provision i agree with the report .
it also logically gives rise to the question of what the commission would do if it was convinced that there was insufficient capacity in a certain area , or if , on the contrary , there was excess capacity .
we should not discuss this until we are blue in the face .
this response includes operational measures and financial assistance .
the commission will know that three ' f ' gases are among the six major greenhouse gases .
in writing . - ( lt ) i voted in favour of this important resolution on a new eu policy framework to fight violence against women .
when is the council going to wake up to the health implications for the citizens of europe and press brazil for realistic traceability in respect of their livestock ?
even within the special regulation for the european freight rail network , the member states must continue to be responsible for creating and changing freight corridors .
the three bodies which must pull on the net and retain a critical distance from olaf , because not everything that olaf does is wonderful , are the council , the commission and parliament .
ecdc is publishing daily updates .
the first task that lies before us is providing adequate funding for the package we have approved , as well as the funding mentioned in mr florenz 's report .
on a personal note , as a young woman embarking on a political career , i stood as an independent candidate for the european parliament , managing to obtain the necessary number of votes , without the help of a party list .
the burden of proof is thus on those countries that want to engage in the limited use of dcm , which must prove that the substance will be used in the safest possible manner and guarantee the protection of workers .
equally cynical is how a number of left colleagues are demanding that we reduce aviation by more than half in only a matter of years .
the copenhagen climate summit may provide the opportunity for forest management to become an integral part of climate protection systems .
subject : development assistance in an economic crisis
europe becomes stronger whenever european solidarity is shown .
but it is not quite like that : first , the grant is only 3.5 % of the cost of the damage - a gesture , as mr ashworth says - and , secondly , it is nine months after the event - and that is fast , they say !
in writing . - ( et ) for years , experts on the right to food at the un , the world bank and the international monetary fund have warned the global public of the possibility of famine .
we need a new political strategy , one that is more discriminating .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , with permission , i did not give mr bin laden as the justification ; i said he helped us to speed it up .
while i have reservations about the idea that a dual system necessarily allows for media pluralism , and while i believe it is impossible to separate private media from financial concerns , i would like to praise a report which advocates the maintenance of public service broadcasting .
we should remember that only when many basic problems of everyday life have been solved will we be able to concentrate on the economic development of the middle east and on close commercial cooperation with the region .
rapporteur . - ( sl ) madam president , it could be that i was not paying enough attention , but according to my voting sheet , we have not voted on part 2 of amendment 62 .
my other remark is that i too support the rights of citizens leaving the internal market to purchase such goods when they leave that market .
in december 2007 , the union agreed that future enlargement strategy would be based on consolidation of commitments , on equitable and rigorous conditionality , and on improved communication .
there were a number of strategies .
in recent weeks , i have made many speeches and i have called for caution in terms of the macro - economic policies of member states .
i would also like to inform mr kelly that we are aware of these problems and i agree with him that we have a lot to do with regard to the traceability of our products .
after the recent incidents related to civil unrest in cap haitien and port - au - prince , we are following closely the security situation with our partners and the relevant un agencies , particularly ahead of the presidential elections of 28 november .
bearing this in mind , the commission wanted to simplify and stimulate cross - border sales of ucits , provide fund managers with effective tools for increasing the size of their funds and benefit from economies of scale .
i voted for this report since the question of refugees in the community is still very relevant .
that is what we , together with several fellow members , are proposing here in parliament .
the oecd study shows that there will be very substantial costs for the social budgets of member states .
we need to give the americans the impression that we are not necessarily reliant on them .
a significant share of russian foreign reserves is in euro , making russia one of the largest holders of euro - denominated assets in the world .
this is therefore the last opportunity to depart from a passive policy .
it results in increased freight charges , a lower standard of service and higher risks to passenger security .
therefore , all we can do to overcome the humanitarian crisis is to appeal for an immediate ceasefire .
in writing . - ( pt ) effective political intervention in the area of illegal immigration must act on two points of the problem , on the origin and on the destination : in other words , as stated in the adopted resolution , ' the authorities of the countries of origin , as well as the strengthening of the criminal legal framework to fight trafficking rings , combating illegal employment and human trafficking ' form essential elements .
internet crime has proliferated , however , and the internet has become a favoured tool of criminal networks , given that it is easily accessible , cheap and very powerful .
living in a lone - parent or jobless household further compounds the risk .
this text has the merit of recognising market failures and advocating the fight against climate change .
member of the commission . - madam president , i would like first to express my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and to all those who are affected by the industrial accident that occurred on 4 october in ajka , hungary .
in short , parliament 's proposals contained solutions that could provide what companies need , that is , flexibility to adapt working hours to different workloads , because the fact is that no two sectors are the same , nor companies within each sector , and because what we need and what my country in particular needs - we hold the sad record of having the highest unemployment rate in the european union - is for our companies to create more employment and fewer redundancies .
the response must be an agreement to revise the interinstitutional agreement rather than patching up edges of the financial rules every year when our backs are to the wall .
moreover , the commission had proposed the promotion of unsolicited credit ratings in order to deal with the disastrous issuer instructions for the evaluation of financial market products .
i voted in favour of this report in view of the fact that the results of the impasse project have revealed that ' the degree of risk associated with alien species could be reduced considerably , possibly to an acceptable level , if the potential for escape of target and non - target organisms is addressed during transportation and by well - defined protocols at the receiving facility ' .
however , i abstained from the final vote because i believe that this report must be rooted more in reality and be more pragmatic and less ideological .
in writing . - ( fr ) in the light of the difficulty in finding new generations of european farmers , the european parliament decided to look at the ways to promote the installation of young farmers , which should guide the cap health check .
i can assure you that i have one overriding goal for the coming years ; to ensure that our union is on track to be strong enough internally to maintain our own social model and externally to defend our interests and project our values .
finally , i want to mention our third objective which , together with the challenge of climate change , the extension of social welfare and the affirmation of social rights , must be developed as a trade mark of europe .
( hu ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am pleased that the european council is discussing the topics of energy security and innovation simultaneously .
the policy of sanctions and isolation we have pursued so far has not brought the anticipated results . it has failed to alter the repressive nature of the authorities .
the clarifications that she has brought to the treaty and the procedural guarantees are reasonable .
i believe that in this way it will prove possible to develop common unified requirements regarding the proper storage of digital materials collected in libraries and archives , and also digital materials - archived , i must stress - collected elsewhere than in archives , in other words in museums and libraries .
your question will almost certainly be answered in writing .
this is , and must remain , the pillar of european integration .
this volcano has not finished erupting yet .
in the wake of several arrests of journalists and trade unionists , who have suffered violence and mistreatment , and of the refusal to grant entry to foreign journalists during the presidential elections , the repression against political opponents and human rights activists continues .
i wonder how this opening of the scope has actually advanced legal certainty and clarity .
this must be made very clear .
i hope that the commission will now take this up .

i therefore welcome the commission 's intention to assess the results of the german or british model first and only then to consider the possible way forward , not being pushed into a blind alley by the socialists .
consequently , the scope of the potential which promoting energy efficiency gives us , especially at a time of economic recession such as the one we are experiencing now , has not been fully understood .
i would also note that the council referred to article 9 in other conclusions : the conclusions on pensions and the conclusions of the council on social services of general interest .
it is therefore impossible to achieve the positive unanimous decision of the council necessary for further joint progress .
oral explanations of vote
patients with rare diseases will be able to benefit from cross - border expertise and diagnosis so long as the treatment is unavailable in their member states .
we have said clearly that a 35 % reduction of co 2 emission is the minimum and we would be prepared to go further .
it expresses its belief that the current definition of agricultural activity for the purposes of single payment should be reviewed , but proposes nothing to amend the current model in which people are paid to not produce .
that decision was adopted by the council in december and we will now implement it .
i believe this should not be just a one - year story .
substantial investments are required in order to gradually reduce dependence on fossil fuels , as well as modernise and make more efficient existing energy production facilities .
madam president , i would like to have some guidance from the rapporteur on two issues .
originally , we entered a level of 30 000 t of butter and 109 000 t of powder , but i have indicated recently that we will be able or willing to go higher than these figures by opening a tender .
if a vat reduction is permitted , all countries should have the right to benefit from it , not just those which won that right , but this is an issue for the future .
what i said to the president of the commission a couple of months ago was : ' please do not oversell what the european council decided in december 2008 .
right now , the european union is in crisis - in spain , unemployment is nearly 20 % , in latvia it is over 20 % , in many other countries , it is well over 10 % .
in the situation in which they are plunged as a result of the neoliberal policies advocated by the european union , one could feel entitled to vote against the beggarly sum that the eurocracy is reluctantly granting them .
the commission , however , feels that repeated interventions in this sector would not be in the spirit of subsidiarity .
for example , there is a banner at the university of vienna reading ' make bologna the process ! ' , which is very fitting , i think .
the question was not answered and should be answered .
now i would like to be very clear on the principles that , in the commission 's view , must necessarily be abided by for such a competitiveness pact , which it might be better to call a ' convergence and competitiveness pact ' , since it involves measures aimed at reducing differences within the euro area , and indeed within the european union .
i voted against the report by mr vlasák on the urban dimension of cohesion policy in the new programming period .
in this way , we can make sure there are no scandals .
it is methodologically correct to review and update the content of conventions , as has been done on this occasion .
the burmese regime should give her back full freedom of movement immediately and release all political prisoners , including those rounded up today .
with enormous courage and dignity he has adopted the austerity measures , whether they are feasible or unfeasible .
poor control and inadequate follow - up of the resources granted every year as part of the eu funds ' projects have resulted in significant amounts of money going into the wrong pockets .
human rights and good governance are for us the backbone of stability in our societies .
tell me , specifically , do you now want us to say ' we do not want your gas until you respect human rights ' ?
this is why , in the new commission , i have created a new ' international cooperation , humanitarian aid and crisis response ' portfolio .
private capital has also dried up .
moreover , there is also the issue of the incapacity to control access to and follow - up these products of animal origin once they enter the commercial system .
the future needs politicians brave enough to have their own opinions , who can look a bit further ahead , and who have a vision for a society with many more working mothers and many more caring fathers .
this mission will be to give grounds for hope , to come up with achievable plans for a future which is not built solely on conflict and inequalities and to offer a vision where science helps us to even out the imbalances which mankind has created or helped to exacerbate .
we had high hopes following the treaty of lisbon .
we have 25 million enterprises in europe .
thank you for your attention .
the debate is closed .
that , too , is social policy .
mr president , i would like to take the floor as shadow rapporteur for the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) for the special european ombudsman 's report .
yet there are still barriers to the free movement of workers : firstly , legal and administrative obstacles that affect all aspects of citizens ' lives ; secondly , social dumping : although article 45 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union guarantees equal treatment for workers , the work of the committee on petitions proves that the reality is quite different ; thirdly , social protection , which varies from one country to the next and so does not encourage mobility .
the commissioner says that we have attached harsh conditions to these loans , but i was not exactly clear as to what these conditions are and , indeed , if they include social conditionality .
madam president , first of all i would like to thank ms polfer for her excellent work and excellent cooperation .
in particular , it is a useful tool against global warming .
the european union should play a more active role in ukraine ; we should stop the practice that has prevailed over the last few years of the european union treating one of the largest states in europe in an uncertain and half - hearted way .
there is a solvit centre in every member state of the european union ( as well as in norway , iceland and liechtenstein ) .
the commission regards the southern corridor as a series of projects including nabucco , south stream and the turkey - greece - italy interconnection ( itg ) .
just three months earlier , no one would have bet even a cent on it .
join us at your peril .
a number of speakers raised the question of the legal base on which this particular provision has been made .
where had they come from ?
we will have to wait some time to find out about the type of projects financed during this short space of time .
the use of the trade defence instruments has to be more accessible , more efficient and more transparent .
the european commission should therefore concentrate on encouraging member states to cooperate more closely with it by inviting them to include in future reports on human rights not just analyses of the situation in the world at large , but in individual member states .
european unification is abhorrent to them and they are afraid that this europe could gain popularity through greater democracy and transparency and also enhanced decision - making abilities to face the challenges of the future .
we need a different policy ; a policy that is open to all these people .
a mapping of eu development assistance in the water sector has been carried out to improve that ongoing dialogue .
and we have a common neighbourhood - some of you have mentioned that , be it moldova or nagorno - karabakh or , of course , georgia .
the report flags up a very serious problem and clearly illustrates the need for action to be taken against such a practice .
this is because of israel 's continual violation of international law , and because of our political commitments to palestine .
( the speaker agreed to take a question under rule 149(8 ) )
they are late coming , but at least they are coming .
as spokesman for the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , i regard the two items before us as being equally important : the commission statement and mrs lucas 's report .
i also share the concern of parliament and the rapporteur , who indicates that the resources for bulgaria which have been frozen or withdrawn by the european commission amount to almost eur 1 billion .
( sl ) they say that a friend in need is a friend indeed .
i support the commission 's proposal on the temporary suspension of the application of common customs tariff duties , as i believe that the eu must demonstrate , and not just declare its solidarity with regions fighting the consequences of the economic crisis .
mr president , i am happy to speak in favour of the alde group motion to refer this back to committee .
africa is a continent with rich natural resources , which are used by the whole world .
i hoped and expected that we would see this level of commitment from him with regard to cloned materials .
if nuclear power facilities which are available in member states are switched on at full capacity , the shortage of energy could be overcome and this would influence prices of goods in the consumer basket .
in writing . - ( el ) the package of economic governance measures proposed by the commission makes provision for stricter discipline in the stability and growth pact and budgetary supervision , by proposing penalties for ' undisciplined ' member states .
my question is how the commission is also active in this respect .
however , we must put under the microscope activities that were undertaken in the past on the basis of a surplus in this budget .
documents received : see minutes
9 .
the next few months will be crucial for budget policy : there will be urgent transfers ; there will be urgent amending budgets arriving over the next few months , to which it will be necessary to give a full response using a new procedure ; and it will be necessary , among other things , to debate a budget balances amending budget using a new procedure that will require great responsibility on the part of all the institutions .
this is an important measure , since it provides an equal opportunity for men and women in the labour market and an opportunity for them to combine their working and family lives .
that is a practice i have wished to encourage from both council and commission for a very long time , so congratulations to you both on achieving that .
the member states are not satisfied .
participation of bulgaria and romania in the eec - san marino agreement on cooperation and customs union ( vote )
it is simply unacceptable that the very same antibiotic costs eur 3 in belgium and eur 34 in germany , for example .
vice - president of the commission . - ( fr ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would first like to thank mrs angelilli warmly for her remarkable report .
the argument is that the car industry is in financial crisis .
directly acceptable : amendment 106 ( text as a whole , block no 1 , compromise amendment ) .
it is not i who decides who must support me .
this meant that , at best , they could only deal half - time with european affairs .
now they are paying the price .
i wish the kosovars and the serbs great courage in this .
the internet has no borders , so if we have different online gambling rules and provisions , it will be like the climate change problem ; much talk and , sadly , few results .
how do they keep those undue windfall profits ?
my question would be : should the european union shift its focus from advertisements , which are commissioned by manufacturers ?
i refute those who argue that this is an illegal act .
nobody is stopping the national governments from implementing it in a year 's time .
in particular , i would like to emphasise the positive nature of the new rules for the parliamentary assistants system , which will bear the hallmark of transparency and balance , while leaving a discretionary choice in the hands of meps .
indeed , member states are not providing the operational and effective regulatory services which would force companies to implement these regulations and penalise them financially for a failure to do so .
in this context , i welcome the proposal , which is repeated throughout the report , for spending to be planned prudently .
the european union plays a difficult role on the stage of peace and war , and i ask , as the session opens , that parliament should join in offering condolences and support to the families of the victims at this very difficult time .
we acknowledge that improvements need to be made , but we should not make additional requests , as these are unnecessary and will only lead to polarisation in this house .
the response was disproportionate .
a detailed and objective assessment of both countries ' compliance with the schengen acquis has been completed .
( sl ) congratulations tanja .
division of the country into two parts is unacceptable .
in writing . - i voted against this report in order to register my objection to the arrogance and disregard shown by political leaders throughout the eu towards the wishes of eu citizens , and to state very clearly that i believe the people of the eu should be given a referendum on this issue .
mr president , honourable members , following the conference in copenhagen , the european union decided quite quickly to proceed via a gradual , pragmatic approach in the future .
i accept that this is a test of credibility for the european union , that any failure to respect the serb population 's rights in the new kosovo would be a victory for ethnic cleansing in reverse , and that we should emphasise that serbia , as well as kosovo , will be equal partners as future members of our european union .
should we , for that reason , stand there with our arms folded and do nothing ?
if greece can demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to the reform package agreed with the european union and the imf , we will accompany greece on its journey back to growth .
it appears from some of the speeches that some of you think that it is the commission 's responsibility to make the decision to move forward at the right pace .
however , the most important and most difficult task is to change people 's habits .
( pl ) madam president , the main reason for the current collapse in the financial sector is the irresponsibility of financial institutions , unsuitable risk management , bad loans and allowing excessive debts to arise without proper guarantees , which has ultimately led to a loss of liquidity .
i am thinking here of two hard - hitting proposals that we have made in the report : the first is to prevent discrimination and the stigmatisation of obese people by officially recognising obesity as a chronic disease , as has been done for example by the who and portugal ; the second is to ensure that all schoolchildren have access to physical exercise and sport - two hours a week would be the minimum requirement in my opinion - along with better funding of school canteens so that fresh products are put on the children 's menu , and here i welcome the commission 's initiative for the free distribution of fruit at school , as referred to by the commissioner .
nevertheless , we need measures that have to be taken in the foodstuffs chain throughout europe .
a uniformly high level remains europe 's best trump card in international competition .
if we listen to today 's discussions , it is quite clear where the greatest fears lie .
and some of these pirates are , of course , fed money as well , which makes it possible for them to invest in further resources .
to secure global economic stability we must work together to find the best way forward , to put credibility and confidence back into the financial institutions and market for citizens globally , but also for the citizens of europe , for their pension funds and also for their savings .
( nl ) mr president , listening to today 's debate one thing stands out , and that is the big issue - important to almost all the political groups - of economic governance .
while their companies are making profits on the european internal market , germany and other countries are being thoroughly miserly when it comes to overcoming the joint challenges faced by europe .
2 .
they will try to create advantages for people on the basis of this legal foundation .
there is a danger that global warming will increase the gap between the developed and the developing countries ; there is no doubt that they will be most affected by the impact of climate change .
i therefore hope that these measures will be adopted as soon as possible within a broader support framework for small and medium - sized enterprises , which need to operate in an easier economic and fiscal environment .
these are past commitments ; this is a question of credibility : when we pay what we said we would pay , we are simply doing what we ought to do , even if it goes beyond the payment appropriations .
i can only support the rapporteur , mrs gomes , and i agree fully with the goal of the adopted chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear ( cbrn ) action plan .
china 's economic growth and increased international standing have still not resulted in any real difference in the approach to civil liberties , abuse of power by the authorities , room for opposition and independence of the judiciary .
this irresponsible attempt was foiled due to the acumen of the italian meps .
finally , the public image of the euro - a currency that is widely identified with the image of the european union - does not reflect all the objective benefits that it brings to citizens .
these have very little own capital ; they are highly leveraged .
this could be one way of reducing co 2 emissions , but it is important - and i am speaking as a member of the committee on the environment , public health and food safety , for which i was the shadow rapporteur - that we generate the hydrogen from renewable energies .
i support the report , which calls for important framework conditions for closed aquaculture facilities and strictly defines the prerequisites for the introduction of exotic fish species .
congratulations !
particular attention must be given to north - south networks .
regarding the issue of revaluation of the slovak currency , i must say that it always took place within the expected limits , within the framework of flexibility that each government , each country is allowed in this process in order be able to respond , in the best possible manner , to the extraordinary moment when the euro is adopted .
after our experience with bse , i do not believe that we should go down this route , nor do i believe that this is necessary if an adequate supply of soya and maize is available to farmers .
consequently , i think that the decoupling levels should be maintained as agreed in 2003 and in any event , if that is not possible , i think that member states should be given some room for manoeuvre , as a voluntary model for each sector , on a case - by - case basis , could create the best circumstances for agricultural production .

another report that seems very important to me is youth on the move , one of the main aims of which is to address early school leaving .
we are talking about whether the extremely complicated and bureaucratic provisions that we currently have in place should be applied to all businesses if , in the first stage of the procedure , they are able to prove that there is absolutely no risk , or that the risk is sufficiently controlled .
( parliament adopted the motion )
the imposition of standards , codes , market rules and even decisions by higher authorities , serving the interests of economic groups , is a recurrent argument .
as regards croatia 's imminent eu accession , it is regrettable that border disputes with slovenia remain outstanding .
this is a report that will help as much as possible to provide more stability and we must ensure as far as possible that all the countries are harmonised with regard to the applicable rates to reduce discrepancies as much as possible .
member of the commission . - mr president , pakistan is on the agenda of this plenary for the third time within a few months .
finally , i am convinced that under the present circumstances a positive conclusion to the doha negotiations could prove to be a factor of stability for the entire world economy .
in fact , if we do not , not only will we be guilty of maintaining a situation which fosters bio - piracy and is a crime at present towards local communities and genetic resources ; we will also miss yet another opportunity for the environment , the negotiations will collapse and we shall have a second copenhagen .
mr president , it is really interesting to hear how some members are very irritated by this famous one voice being challenged and the whole status quo being challenged .
as regards heading 4 , it is extremely important to leave a substantial margin to the ceiling under this heading in order to be able to cope with unforeseen needs in the best possible way .
we also need to start thinking about innovative proposals that we ourselves have put forward in our parliamentary debate and which are now being taken up in a more authoritative way by leading figures such as chancellor merkel .
i think that 25 % compensation for maritime passengers for two to three hours ' delay is perfectly appropriate , as is 50 % for delays of over three hours - but i would say to mr teychenné that 100 % compensation for delays in excess of this is simply excessive .
they were produced more cheaply than under the system of green certificates and , most importantly , this made it possible to introduce new players into the electricity market .
need i spell out exactly what will be required of the irish in relation to the lisbon treaty ?
thus , for example , the council can blacklist individuals responsible for the repressive measures of recent months .
i received a petition from european textile producers expressing their opposition to this , as they were afraid that pakistan would export more to europe , which they did not want .
this clearly demonstrates that the who needs to revise its pandemic criteria .
( ga ) mr president , we are undoubtedly facing a great challenge at present and we urgently need to look at new ways of solving all those problems .
in my opinion , any intervention on an eu level would be an intervention in subsidiarity and would therefore go too far .
on behalf of the uen group . - mr president , once a beacon of hope , an example of african self - empowerment and a leader among african states , zimbabwe is now the epicentre of african despair and hopelessness .
what we see is that the council has not always followed the commission 's proposals , whether on transparency or prospectuses , the definition of cross - border missions or equivalences .
that is , allowing them to remain active and not to stop after retirement .
we must avoid double standards and show that we will act in accordance with our values in european union foreign policy .
it was i who launched the campaign ' do you know where your child is now ? '
i worked as a volunteer in malawi for a few months and i was appalled at the treatment of women there .
they have their own agenda , a european agenda , and they are an integral part of european political life .
on behalf of the verts / ale group . - ( es ) madam president , on behalf of my group , i would like to first of all congratulate mr schmitt on this report , and also stress the importance of increasing the number of hours of teaching of physical education in schools .
schengen cooperation is now integrated into the european union legal and institutional framework and comprises 25 schengen member states , along with three countries that are associated with the eea : norway , iceland and switzerland .
four years ago , mr saakashvili said in this chamber that georgians are not only one of the oldest nations of europe , but that they are also intensely interested in european integration .
this is a concrete proposal which would enable us to address the over - reliance of the global financial regulatory system on some non - public credit ratings .
in writing . - ukip fully supports the relief efforts and is horrified at the loss of life and those affected by the disaster , but we cannot support legitimising the eu in spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers ' money , along with its militaristic and diplomatic ambition to circumvent democratic and accountable nation states intervening in the crisis .
however , they are also directed at the council , which will meet again in december in response to the progress report .
opening of the sitting
there is not much more to add since i feel that the president - in - office of the council has described the results splendidly .
the 100th anniversary of that event falls in the very year we are talking about - 2014 .
on behalf of the ecr group . - mr president , i support this treaty change and my group supports it , because we want to see stability within the eurozone .
in 1992-1996 , sarajevo - the martyr city where , in 1914 , the first world war started - would become the victim of destruction during the time it was besieged .
at its best remote sensing is a way to obtain information quickly on the condition of farms , crop yields and growing conditions .
we thus call on the commission and council to take specific measures here .
in season three of the simpsons , ' homer alone ' , the same issue is addressed .
in particular , the report proposes a harmonisation of penalties by means of a common categorisation of fines .
- ( el ) mr president , the slovenian presidency is very fortunate to be following on from two successful presidencies .
this plan looks to recognise and reward proactive organisations that go beyond what environmental laws expect of them and that are constantly improving the way they interact with the environment .
in addition , there was a special focus on rules .
as others have said , the legal fishing sector is under severe threat and the impact of this illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing is just part of the problem .
mr president , i rise to express my concern about thousands of innocent civilians who have been turned into refugees in their own homeland by the taliban in the swat valley .
i do not support the ban on exporting radioactive waste , but i call for all the specific contracts signed between member states and third countries to comply with recommendation 2008/956 / euratom on criteria for the export of radioactive waste and spent fuel to third countries .
i would like to say to mr schulz that i entirely agree with him .
i consider it essential to guarantee children and pregnant women good health conditions .
however , i would like to mention two aspects .
it is the result of a long and complex negotiation process between the european commission and mauritania that was launched in october 2007 , following serious under - utilisation of the protocol by european ship - owners , namely under - utilisation for cephalopods and the small pelagic species .
to date , we have 21 organisations in 15 member states .
moreover , as commissioner barnier has also pointed out , i believe that both italian and spanish companies will also benefit from the creation of the unitary european patent system .
it is our duty to take care of and ultimately also to enforce their right to mobility .
electronic stability control could save the lives of around 4 000 people every year , and if the in - vehicle emergency call system e-call were fully deployed throughout europe , the number of road injuries and fatalities could be reduced by as much as 5-15 % . this would save more than 2 500 lives every year and represent financial savings of eur 22 billion .
there is a dual perception of wilderness in european culture .
the ultimate aim of these proposals is to generate greater market demand in order to boost production and support the european economy as a whole .
to add insult to injury , the recent revelations about members of this house who agreed to amend or write legislation in exchange for payment further erode the credibility of this parliament , particularly in its efforts to fight fraud and corruption .
i would like to stress that the european union budget is not a budget of the same kind as the national budgets .
parliament rightly highlights its new role as colegislator on the same footing as the council after the treaty of lisbon comes into force .
the report included an assessment of achievements and shortcomings .
i listened to the talk about greening .
some member states have tried to resolve these problems by working with the un , but these efforts , however , have proved unsuccessful .
put the lisbon treaty to the vote .
( el ) mr president , greece , ireland , portugal and spain are suffering the consequences of the economic crisis .
i ask the european commission to support the new member states in accessing the available community instruments to develop transport infrastructure .
i think you will agree with me when i say that europe and the europeans have good reason to feel satisfied with political developments over the last six months .
these tests can be passed only if we all give of our best .
a perfect example , once again , of how profits are privatised and losses nationalised .
it is of great concern that only 3 % of european agricultural output is of protein crops .
mrs fontaine gave a good outline of the strong recommendations it contains .
4 .
with regard to mrs beňová 's question about fundamental rights , it is precisely in order to give this new sign of commitment that i decided to create - and i would add that the proposal came from the european parliament , even though i was already convinced on the matter - the post of commissioner responsible for fundamental rights and individual freedoms .
as the speed of integration of the countries in this region varies , every country must make maximum effort , carry out the required reforms and take the necessary measures to ensure the security and stability of every country , as well as of the region as a whole .
it is also worth bearing in mind that the largest producers of these raw materials are located outside the european union and that in comparison , the position of the member states is very poor indeed .
i voted in favour of this proposal since i believe it is a matter of great importance for portugal , and particularly for its outermost regions , which are more vulnerable to the crisis we are experiencing , since they feel its effects more intensely and take longer to emerge from it .
i therefore call on you to conclude a common package with bosnia and albania and to start visa talks with kosovo .
i should be grateful for your comments on these points .
experience has taught us that all dictatorships come to an end !
i would be very pleased if everything that mrs kolarska - bobińska has written and that has received the support of a large majority is actually retained .
we made a mistake , and we admit it .
if we do that - not through monoculture - then we can find biofuels to be part of the solution .
is there anything more ridiculous ?
the commission target does not just come from nowhere . according to the motor industry , it is technically achievable and can generate an innovative export product .
with the help of the european union , will we manage to gather the required political will and ensure alternative means of transporting passengers so that we can avoid such consequences in similar crisis situations .
in some cases they have been forced to give way to wishy - washy , colourless and insipid compromises .
every effort must therefore be made to protect a child 's right to a family life .
the implementation of the abortive anti - labour law on the ' liberalisation ' of services , known as the bolkestein directive , promotes sweeping reactionary changes at the expense of the working and grassroots classes .
we need to facilitate the cooperation between member states on a daily basis .
we need to finalise the agreement .
the growth in freight transport may necessitate a supplementary infrastructure to prevent the two interfering with each other .
parliament is a european institution , the commission is a european institution and the council is also a european institution .
i am happy to listen to the views of those of you in the chamber and to speak again at the end .
care will also have to be taken to protect shareholders and creditors .
( es ) mr president , i would like to raise a point of order : i do not have my voting card with me because it was not planned that there would be a vote now , and so i ask you to note my wish to vote in favour of the order of business remaining unchanged .
1 .
besides the leipzig charter and the territorial agenda , the first action programme under the portuguese presidency , territorial cohesion was included as a community objective in the reform treaty .
we understand that continuous and sustained support for the economic development of the palestinian territories is one of the bases for peace .
on behalf of the efd group . - mr president , the theory of a tobin tax has been around for years - the idea of a global tax on foreign exchange - but , of course , it has never seen the light of day .
are these observation missions important ?
that was a comprehensive statement of the theoretical position on burden - sharing .
moreover , it should be inclusive , above all , for the more than 20 million europeans who feel excluded because they have been shut out of the labour market by the brutal crisis .
i voted for this report because it is extremely important .
my group does not accept the compromise that the presidency and the rapporteur laboriously arrived at , not because we are opposed to a european return policy but because we feel that the result is very inadequate as regards protecting fundamental rights .
as i mentioned , japan has very high food safety standards .
in writing . - ( pt ) what happened today in the vote in plenary session was regrettable .
there have , of course , been comments in this chamber to the effect that this is not the most important of matters in the wider scheme of things , and no doubt it is not .
i do not think that many people believed it , but our perseverance has paid off .
( nl ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in the debate on the florenz motion for a resolution , it was rightly observed yesterday that a large majority of the population support strict measures to ban smoking at the workplace and in bars and restaurants .
any esdp operation in chad and the central african republic must be based on a un security council resolution and will be conducted in strict consultation with the un and our african partners .
at this point , i would like to address mr tremopoulos , who , if i may say , is hardly in a position to speak like this , because it is precisely his country which has just recently received a much bigger amount than bulgaria is claiming at the moment , due to its blackmail .
according to the proposed regulation , operators must minimise the risk of placing illegally logged timber and related products on the market by demonstrating due diligence , when they place these products on the european union market , in obtaining information on the provenance and legality of the products in question .
statistics represent only a starting point in developing adequate housing policies for each member state .
this is also what it means to be part of europe .
they do not want any more indiscriminate immigration from eastern europe .
in this context , i believe that we need a strategy .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
i would like to conclude by reminding you that the right to effective legal protection is a fundamental right enshrined in european constitutions and , specifically , in article 47 of the charter of fundamental rights of the european union .
we are interdependent on each other in the challenges that attack us , but also in the solutions which we can arrive at .
a high percentage of them have happened in the so - called free trade zones with their maquiladora industry ( sub - contractor companies which produce for the export market ) , in which the absence of a social infrastructure and high poverty rates are accompanied by impunity for semi - legal security forces .
that is mostly in this part of europe , where there is no emergency situation .
mr landsbergis , do not tell untruths .
all in all , mr president , i am extremely grateful for what has been said by all the spokespeople for the different parliamentary groups .
the debate is closed .
we had originally agreed to put it on the agenda on the assumption that everything was in order .
in the negotiating result achieved after two months , not all that much remained of the recommendation by the committee on the environment and that was due not to the rapporteur , but to the uncompromising position of the council .
this will therefore be the spirit in which the commission 's measures are coordinated .
( nl ) mr president , the text before us is , indeed , a compromise and we would have liked to have been a little more ambitious here and there , particularly when it comes to the timing and the level of the penalties .
the petitioner is told beforehand what he might ask for , which is something within the competence of the commission , and what he might not ask for , which is something deemed by the commission to be lacking in seriousness or contrary to so - called european values .
it is therefore becoming more and more difficult to ensure consistency .
it is not up to us , as europeans , to say what the composition of these countries ' governments should be .
we need to prepare a mid - term review based on concrete data in order to ensure that the seventh framework programme continues to meet european requirements .
i think it is important to remind ourselves about this , from where we are now .
i expressly welcome the decision by the government to comply with the 13th amendment to the sri lankan constitution and hand over the competent provincial council to the elected representatives of the north and the east .
it will be beneficial to extend the reduced rates to babies ' nappies and equipment for people with disabilities , electronic books , environmental sewerage and recycling works , as well as all housing , places of worship and cultural and artistic heritage , restaurants , gardening and personal care services .
can we expect an increase in demand for these tankers , and will russia 's fleet of tankers receive the necessary investment to avoid further use of single - hull , 40 - year - old tankers and vessels designed for river use ?
for this reason i consider the package of decisions adopted by the european commission with the aim of boosting flexibility in drawdowns from the structural funds by member states to be a positive response to the ongoing economic crisis .
there were signs that if ireland did not accept the document , it would have to keep voting until the required outcome was achieved .
secondly , taking into consideration the cultural particularities of the roma people , the solution for its integration should be found at european level by drafting a coherent and comprehensive strategy .
we are asking for time , ladies and gentlemen , mr president , to allow us to come back to parliament within a few weeks , a few months , to be able to guarantee that we have created the foundations for the signing of a definitive agreement that adequately addresses the concerns expressed by certain honourable members today .
we have therefore voted for parliament 's approval of the proposal .
we are talking about the european schools today , and i am grateful to mrs hennicot for that .
what has the council actually done with the findings , both our findings and the findings of the council of europe ?
we had refused to talk to mr haniyeh and , not surprisingly , having undermined the democratic forces , the forces of violence took over .
hopefully , future ecofin meetings would enhance better approaches regarding financial assistance .
poverty and dependence on imports are the main cause of food insecurity .
for this reason , we can only call on the government to change .
are we going to abide by the council 's decision , under pressure from one member state , which shows a certain lack of regard for the union and the european citizens ?
vice - president of the commission . - mr president , on behalf of the commission , i would like to give the following explanation .
however , we cannot accept the argument that , in order to serve the interests of the citizens better through improved management of post - disaster situations , we need to limit the member states ' involvement and room for manoeuvre .
what is your justification for this ?
this is an important issue .
although practical tests at national level have yielded quite positive results , opinions on these vehicles differ .
this is what i urge the commission and the council to do .
we are going to present the new stockholm programme 2010-2014 in a communication in spring 2009 .
1 .
however , my support is conditional on these changes not hampering transparency or resulting in account users having limited access to information .
while the first pillar , financed solely from the eu budget , must support the level of societal demands that we attach to agriculture , the second , cofinanced pillar must continue to support the modernisation of agriculture and agri - foods so as to take the new contexts into account .
in writing . - i was delighted to vote in favour of the extension of the mandate of the european network and information security agency ( enisa ) until september 2013 .
i would also like to thank mrs de keyser and mr salafranca for their detailed and stimulating report .
the process of ratification should continue , and i am confident that ireland will make every effort to resolve the situation .
how can we guarantee the fundamental right of all european citizens to move freely within our common area without offering them the opportunity to be treated easily in a member state other than the one in which they are resident ?
this method cannot provide a long - term solution , given the risks it poses to our ecosystem .
that is the only way to prevent separatism .
i can tell you that seeing the new message , strategy and philosophy that i detect at the world bank makes me quite optimistic .
as regards the european economic recovery plan , the eu 's budget is not of such magnitude as to be able to be used for keynesian stimulus policy , but it can be used for certain small but strategic matters , such as the recovery plan .
the council of the european union is about to adopt a new joint action on landmines within the framework of the common foreign and security policy .
but we shall see .
therefore , beyond rhetoric , how can we respond to the tragedy in this region ?
protection for investors has been improved and transparency has been increased .
on behalf of the verts / ale group . - madam president , can i thank the high representative , baroness ashton , for her statement .
five thousand lobbyists out of the 15 000 operating in brussels have access to the european parliament .
in this context , we explicitly ask the commission to publish a report next year on the adequacy of the standards as they currently stand , on whether it is desirable , possibly , to do some more work on what is known as the list of minor foodstuffs and on whether it is still appropriate to maintain that list any longer .
nowadays , at least in the european union , civil aviation is a necessary part of our life , without which the parliament and the council simply could not work .
we would do better to recognise it and prepare responses to it .
yes , let us applaud the czech senate all the way from strasbourg to prague .
all negotiations in the igc and the linguistic lawyers ' group have been kept absolutely secret so far as many members in this parliament are concerned .
i have not heard a single word about this .
for here too it holds that words are one thing , actions are what counts .
that is why i call on you to work with the member states to implement as quickly as possible the four - year action plan on combating counterfeiting and piracy , with the creation of a european counterfeiting observatory and the strengthening of the european customs system .
the directive provides a framework to upgrade the energy performance of the eu 's buildings .
unfortunately , we are finding out more day by day , and we are faced with an issue which needs us to show flexibility and collective intelligence to find suitable solutions .
it is a mistake .
they will not get a new house or better accommodation from any airline companies or eu governments .
i hope that this will happen in the future .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on the environment , public health and food safety . - ( el ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report is complete and coherent .
we have witnessed a contraction of gross domestic product , a drop in economic activity and an increase in budget deficits , resulting in reduced tax receipts and creating unsustainable public debt : it has been difficult to achieve figures comparable with those existing before the crisis .
we spoke with great approval of the effects of his work when he was a guest here in the european parliament .
member of the commission . - madam president , this discussion today on the europe 2020 strategy has been extremely interesting and useful for us , the commission , as was this morning 's discussion on economic governance .
for this same reason , i consider it crucial to strengthen the commission 's control procedures relating to the application and usage of the cohesion fund , reinforcing the mechanisms of good governance .
i see the way forward as prioritising such policies that would decrease the pressure on capital cities and support the development of second - tier cities .
these include intellectual property .
the network addressed four questions to the spring summit on 10 march , and the european parliament should specifically endorse these questions .
furthermore , the new anti - terrorist ordinance must be urgently brought into line with internationally accepted standards , safeguarding personal rights and freedoms .
we must , however , get something straight here : this is the result of badly coordinated , local public transport that has been economised to death , the boom in shopping centres on the edges of towns whilst local shops are in decline , the falling quality of living conditions in the inner city , the rising crime rate , neighbourhoods that are home to large numbers of foreigners turning into ghettoes and , last but not least , longer journey times to work owing to urban sprawl and greater flexibility in working hours and employment relationships and the associated role of the car as a prerequisite for gainful employment .
therefore i wish to ask mr lobo antunes very directly indeed : what are you waiting for to demand that the european governments and the us government put an end to this practice that we have condemned on so many occasions ?
of course we will not get it through the g 20 if we do not even try it first at european level !
the rich industrial states of the eu are now obliged to support the poorer countries financially so that immediate measures can be taken to counter the consequences of climate change .
at the same time , for certain sectors of industry which have a particularly serious environmental impact , minimum mandatory requirements must be set at european union level .
it is absolutely clear that there is currently a majority of transport ministers in the council to whom environmental interests are of no concern .
we would also welcome it if your planning were not only to cover the first few months of 2009 but were perhaps to encompass a two - year cycle which could be developed further on a year - by - year basis .
i think it is crucial that , by imposing sanctions , the european union reveals its strengths and not its weaknesses .
in fact , sweden has taken a step backwards rather than taking the opportunity to push for more challenging objectives in the area of the environment and climate change .
yes , we do need to denounce and stop the abuses that are committed by one or the other of the warring parties in that region , but we need to be very careful with regard to the procedure used if we want the justice to be established in the region to lead us in the direction of a lasting peace .
madam ashton will , on that point too , have to seek very active coordination with turkey , more active than has hitherto been the case .
we always take into account the need to increase the coverage of this public register .
this is why i am asking the house to agree that in this exceptional case , we should remove this urgent matter from the agenda , because this will be of greater help in resolving the case than debating it would be .
this proposal is exploiting admirable humanitarian responses to the appalling tragedies that we have seen in order to take further steps towards the creation of the european protection force called ' europe aid ' as outlined in the barnier report .
it is demanded of politicians that they be capable of doing something for the communities that they serve .
it is a process that is made easier not by strict constraints that create unaffordable costs for citizens and businesses , but by real incentives ; a process that is realised by means of energy infrastructure , changing urban development , products , packaging and transport .
of course , we can apply new technology and new research with all the will in the world , but if we continue to have a system where , despite all the innovation , governments tell individual fishermen in detail how much they can fish , then all the applied research will be a complete waste of time .
it is important , therefore , to enter into the dialogue with the assumption that the vast majority of the muslim communities who live in our society want nothing to do with what is a perverse interpretation of their faith , and that we invest a great deal in that broad dialogue of my group , this year too , the year of cultural dialogue .
i agreed with this resolution on flegt voluntary partnership agreements with the republic of cameroon and the republic of congo .
as i said this weekend at camp david , open societies need the rule of law and democracy .
the situation in egypt is similar , even though things are moving fast .
as you have recognised , the importance of adult learning is clearly increasing .
however , when it comes to the actual legislation we always take a nifty step backwards .
i deplore that innocent civilians are used as human shields .
that is why i am speaking today .
voting time
in the kingdom of eurocrats , a clear conscience comes cheap .
the aim of the present proposal is to merge two existing council regulations on internal and external promotion into one single regulation .
that should not be the case .

that is why the commission can support the amendments put forward in mrs angelilli 's report . they will then pave the way for a successful first - reading agreement with the council .
they could never have got these rules through the national parliaments .
let us not have any illusions however .
i would like to emphasise the fact that it was others who did not take them into account .
why has this not been monitored more intensively ?
firstly , we very much welcome the fact that the european commission has included a proposal for a european company statute in its legislative programme for next year .
that letter also announced the suspension , from 1 january 2009 , of disbursements from the budgetary aid programmes , as well as the opening of a consultation period with the nicaraguan authorities concerning the current situation and the methods of reorienting european cooperation with the country .
it is for that reason that i am voting against this report .
we are shutting people out and , in so doing , we are putting lives at risk .
what specific measures will it undertake to that end , and within what time - framework ?
we saw similar scenes in my home country , the united kingdom , last year when excel airways went bankrupt , leaving over 200 000 people out of pocket , without compensation and stranded at a whole host of airports throughout europe , with it costing them even more money to find accommodation and flights home .
( the sitting was closed at 10.10 p.m. )
let me reassure you that we acknowledge the new role of parliament in line with the treaty of lisbon .
in the light of this quality drive for european wine , there is also a continuing need for national support measures , and these have been set at eur 1.3 billion .
i should say that french hunters are quite satisfied that the four categories have been maintained : this is an important issue in france , and i am very pleased this evening that we managed to retain them .
the transport committee has argued for this in the case of airlines , and it is right to require that hotels , too , should not discriminate against this social group .
the new logic of economic organisation based on innovations in environmental technology , which has the support of international capital markets , is also a fundamental feature of the us president barack obama 's programme .
it is a question of political will , mr reinfeldt , mr barroso .
where an international couple decide to divorce , they may therefore invoke different laws .
it must surely be illegal for the czech republic to transfer to the us any information from common eu databases , such as the visa information system .
transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing .
greater unity does not mean that we have to lose diversity .
we will make sure that this evidence is provided to the european parliament with concrete examples , both from the three countries we are discussing and from the subsequent eu pnr .
mr simpson 's absence demonstrates that the issue is indeed still current , and that the consequences of such eruptions are unpredictable and can be far - reaching in terms of our citizens ' mobility , and also in economic terms if the situation is protracted .
the problem with this text is that only a few categories of goods are provided for in the current proposal for a regulation .
we need effective strategic plans which include appropriate eu financial aid for promoting democracy , civil society and human rights .
( cs ) madam president , illegal employment not only affects five to ten million people but , in particular , those who employ them .
this , in fact , opens the way for a network where it is not a foregone conclusion that all users will have access to the whole network and where not all sites have the same possibility of being viewed .
we should not try and do everything .
europe will thus be able to take this leadership forward and create jobs on its own territory and , at the same time , create a win - win situation with global solutions .
- ( lt ) from reading the guide to the european union i still remember it stating that the member states ' solidarity is one of europe 's most significant values , with small countries , i.e. the benelux countries , being the real driving force behind the eu internal market .
i was not shocked by your defence of industry in general and german industry in particular , because i see too often - i say this to mr schulz , as well as to mr daul - i see too often the devastating effects of the financial crisis in countries that have not defended their industries strongly enough .
this is therefore about strengthening the role of the european parliament .
therefore , i should like to thank the commissioner for her response , as it contains positive elements to help us really achieve something of benefit to 500 million european citizens .
i have a few political comments to make on the actual budget which we are voting on this year and i say political , because the political role of the budget should ultimately be to allow us , through the budget , to play our part as the european union .
i would like to thank everyone for their work on this dossier over recent years .
( el ) madam president , it is widely accepted that the current distribution of seats in the european parliament does not properly represent the demographic realities in the member states and that the correlations are unfavourable for certain medium - sized and smaller countries .
i even recovered industrial waste from a mountain which had been designated as a household waste tip and we also saw an out - of - order incinerator , or at least what appeared to be one .
albino killings in tanzania ( vote )
this is why we have faced the problem of shark finning in recent years .
however , compliance with imported products to equivalent quality specifications remains a problem .
today , if we make no changes , we shall reach 19 % .
i also want to highlight the lack of women 's rights particularly in the third world .
this is why i think that it must be improved and promoted by us and member states so that as many european citizens as possible learn about solvit 's existence and can defend their rights by calling upon solvit for assistance .
consumers therefore have no idea whom to trust .
this is the result of nation - destroying liberal thinking , among other things .
many congratulations on this convincing result !
written explanations of vote
why can there not be a citizens ' initiative calling for the treaty to be amended and for the further development of the european constitution ?
to sum up briefly , my compliments to mrs ayala sender on her report and i hope that the course embarked upon can be taken further later on in the year .
one agency after another is created , in order to be paid for consent to difficult topics by an undertaking for an interesting agency . '
then the other side will arrange for humanitarian aid to be taken to gaza .
it is a theory and a very long way from proof .
russia 's bans on imports of polish meat and vegetables continue to form a major obstacle to the start of negotiations .
at the same time , however - and this is the core of our concern , i believe , and i understand it is also that of some of my fellow members - public television broadcasters are absolutely vital in protecting our cultural and linguistic diversity and ultimately in binding our societies together because , in theory , they are looking for something more than direct profit .
to reiterate , this is a success story : it demonstrates how parliament and the commission can work together .
international law and moral principles give the european union the opportunity of accelerating the granting of legal status to individuals whose life in their country of birth , outside the european union , is impossible .
firstly , the adoption of earthquake protection measures should in future be an essential requirement for the funding of infrastructure from the structural funds , especially in view of the fact that earthquakes threaten the overall economic and social cohesion of the regions affected .
in the latter case , responsibility will partly be in the hands of countries which are not member states , giving the unelected commission a major say .
mr president , i have seen that the entire western world , with the united states at the forefront , is demanding an earlier election in pakistan .
mr president , i am sorry to interrupt the voting at the end but i think there was one error .
time to step on the gas .
europe buys 38 million tonnes of soya and feed for cattle .
you know what is my bible ?
the text voted on today is the fruit of a very hard - fought compromise , but one which pleases us given the direction taken in the debate and in the negotiation itself .
however , 400 kilometres in europe means crossing borders .
we do not need a bloated eu budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary ; we do not need a budget funded by the eu taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise ; we do not need a further bloating of brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors .
as we know , although displaced inhabitants always leave very quickly , their return takes time and is all too often a source of considerable humanitarian and social problems .
the primacy of community law is thus established over national legislation and even national constitutional provisions .
it is important to debate this .
mr president , may i first of all congratulate mrs gutiérrez - cortines .
it is clear that the biggest threats come from two directions : nuclear weapons that are in the hands of undemocratic regimes which are answerable to no one and the irresponsible use of civilian nuclear resources .
however , this position was only the viewpoint of the communist party of greece , not of our group as a whole , which supported my proposals , as did the vast majority of this parliament .
we must also improve the way in which we manage our resources , including the management of restructuring funds .
the european union special representative and the european commission will also continue their efforts to build confidence in support of a resolution of the conflicts in georgia .
one is to provide assistance following the misfortune that has recently befallen it .
the real crisis is not in the subprime mortgage market but rather in the ten times larger casino economy of the increasingly esoteric and fantasy world of the derivatives market , which needs to be brought under control .
lithuania is a member state of the eu and has thus undertaken to share these common values of the 500 million citizens of the union .
however , we also know the price to be paid for not having a europe ; we have paid it enough throughout our history .
this is why i consider referenda to be a key aspect of the treaty ratification process .
please allow me to add that not only do these results allow us to feel satisfied , but they also give prestige to our institutions : parliament , the council and the european commission .
that is why it pains me all the more to have to pour cold water on this matter .
mr leichtfried , when you rightly spoke about the political problems that we have encountered , the political problems concern the member states , but we have seen that unfortunately , the commission 's proposal was not accepted , despite a huge effort .
this type of behaviour can only be encouraged .
mr barroso used it , mr van rompuy used it : ' stability ' .
we have essentially incorporated a judgment of the federal constitutional court that created a new fundamental right .
- ( cs ) it is an important and perfectly legitimate aim to have clean vehicles , but today local authorities already have the option to include environmental considerations in contracts for public transport services .
that is an undeniable success for the council under the french presidency and i would like to thank you , mr jouyet , and pay tribute to the good work that you and your colleagues have done , in particular mr novelli .
what action is needed to resolve the terrible crisis that we are experiencing ?
i say this based on our experience of a common approach since 9/11 and with a view to the efficiency of the single market for aviation .
there is a lot on the ' to do ' list and i personally believe that healthy realism would be appropriate , because there are some on the team who are simply overloading the council with too many topics - including psychologically difficult matters such as the poultry issue .
there are so many names which i could refer to at this point , but i would just like to mention mikhail sergeyevich gorbachev and george bush senior .
i am quite confident that the irish government will come forward with a plan of how things should happen .
the rules for mobilising this fund need to be adapted to allow more flexible and timely mobilisation , addressing a wider range of disasters with significant impacts and reducing the time that elapses between the disaster and the point at which the funds are made available .
we will be providing the available regional funds to wales and to all the other regions in future .
in writing . - i echo adamos adamou 's calls for policy action at eu level in the area of organ donation and transplantation .
the debate is closed .
forty years on , sadly , little seems to have changed .
i suppose the reasons why that is the case are very complex and varied .
we have also placed a great deal of emphasis on smes and on vulnerable persons , especially the disabled .
as i say , hypocrisy apparently knows no bounds .
in about a week 's time the referendum on the treaty will take place in ireland .
what a regrettable situation !
the main basis of this legislative act is non - discrimination against agency workers in terms of payment , social and employee rights and applicable legislation .
this parliament has repeatedly called on the member states to devote far greater urgency to addressing the auditors ' concerns , and in particular , we have called on the member states to meet the terms of the 2006 interinstitutional agreement .
i do not wish to discuss here the importance of rating agencies .
the commission will also examine the regulatory framework on safety in nuclear power plants and by the end of the year will suggest any improvements that may prove to be necessary .
this money is not being spent on developing sustainable and competitive employment for the future .
finally , i should like to welcome the work of eurolat .
mr president , the internal market is an extremely important part of the european cooperation , but for many consumers it is nothing more than a vague concept .
we welcome the overall trend towards liberalisation of the global trade in bananas , including the current wto agreement , as well as bilateral agreements with the central american and andean countries , and possibly one day with mercosur .
second lesson : the 27 must concentrate on their budgetary policies very early on in proceedings .
yes , the resolution is necessary and correct .
there has been no surge .
i saw the paperwork that has been heaped upon a particular producer because he is already within the ambit of these regulations .
i supported this important document .
micro - businesses really need to be treated like family units and , in particular , the eu and its member states need to work together to look at how small businesses can be given upfront support for energy efficiency improvements .
at times , we are tempted to believe that this is a phenomenon that takes place on the fringes of our society when , in reality , violence against women is carried out above all within the home .
well , we must be thankful for small mercies .
therefore the subsidy principle sometimes leads to a situation where some of the structural assistance is not used efficiently .
we must reduce bureaucracy and promote transparency in all areas of consumer rights .
( es ) madam president , i am also going to talk about venezuela , because there are some people who do not understand that democracy is not just about casting votes .
it was the first time i have heard the names being called out in advance , when the number of speakers was limited , so that other members who would not be able to speak could go about their business .
in terms of timing , it fits exactly in the current window , which we should use , because in the area of package travel , there is a whole range of issues when consumers are not properly informed about their rights .
first of all , when we speak of an intelligent car , we must not forget that a very important part of an intelligent car is an intelligent driver .
it is in his interests to polarise and divide public opinion in poland and europe .
while i welcome the readiness for dialogue , i must reiterate that this is not an attack on hungary .
in exceptional cases , however , the eu may authorise the member state to enter into bilateral agreements : if the community has no interest in agreements with the third country , if the individual member state has a particular interest in the agreement and the agreement does not negatively impact community law .
is the commission taking the initiative going to be a question of weeks or a question of months ?
president barroso has announced some policy guidelines on this matter to the european parliament .
however , despite supporting the creation of a ' european civil protection force ' as a ' centralised prevention and management instrument ' - a policy we disagree with - it states that this ' only makes sense on the basis of improved national civil protection schemes , and of better instruments for coordination between member states ' , which in our opinion raises the question again as it should be raised .
concentrating too much on this aspect will give the impression of an unjustified egocentricity on the part of members of the european parliament .
the one - minute speeches come in , we get allocated time but it is pathetic .
what we need are strategic solutions for the past but , above all , for the future .
more recently , at the end of ataka 's european election campaign , a billboard displayed a banner stating : ' baleva on the scaffold - the german jew tied to the stake ! '
whatever happened to the agreement being negotiated by frontex with turkey today ?
i have regularly attacked mr mccreevy in the house on the issue of hedge funds and private equity .
i can tell you in advance that introducing contractual relations between industrial firms and farmers will , in the long term , result in those industries competing with each other , on a europe - wide scale .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , president , first of all i would like to greet the president of the dtp party , mr ahmet türk , who is a vip guest here to follow the debate .
we believe that all rights are residual in the individual .
one is country of origin .
i personally would like to go further still .
however , i am concerned by the fact that no clear decision has been made on the eu 's contribution and each member state 's share of the total burden , taking into account each country 's ability to pay .
in the case of immediate exclusion , the urgency must be duly justified .
for this reason , in addition to current diplomatic activities , the european union must continue its efforts to build the palestinian infrastructure , with the training of security forces and reinforcement of the authority of the palestinian administration .
how can we mediate for citizens in a dispute with their country without the country attending the committee on petitions ?
we note that the number of opium - free provinces in afghanistan has more than doubled this year .
( pl ) it is with great pain that we observe what is going on in the gaza strip .
madam president , i would first of all like to add my thanks to our rapporteur for all his hard work on this delicate subject .
in this context , the presidency will make efforts towards further progress in schengen cooperation , in police and customs cooperation , and in cooperation between member states in civil and criminal matters .
i would therefore like to focus on two issues of particular importance in the retail area , our consideration of the framework for retail investment products , and our work on bank account mobility .
as such , it needs to assert its position and ensure that it is capable of meeting the mobility and transport requirements , increasing productivity , improving safety and benefiting the environment .
we need much more pressure .
not only is president sarkozy going to the olympic games , but also , on 16 june , broadcasts by a group that broadcast into china via eutelsat , with the permission of the french authorities , were suspended .
therefore , voting will be held on this matter tomorrow .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i will concentrate on the report on anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay and our group 's view on this matter .
we know who the additional ringleaders that need to be targeted are , we know who the henchmen are , who the bag carriers are .
in writing . - i accept the need to improve the energy efficiency of buildings , and i am persuaded that the eu can play a positive role in this respect .
this is fundamental to improving patients ' everyday life .
the principles of transparency and duty of disclosure , and also controls , must be guaranteed .
( applause )
one cannot expect every report to be written as though one had drafted it oneself , but there is much to find fault with here .
in writing . - ( ro ) there is absolutely no question that in the interest of the safety and health of all european citizens , the eu and member states must give top priority to the decommissioning of the relevant nuclear power plants in the new member states .
we will also include measures for integrated maritime surveillance , and we will have private - sector involvement because , with regard to maritime issues , i believe this to be absolutely necessary .
( pt ) at the summit , europe spoke clearly about how china is perverting wto rules , failing to respect workers ' rights , exporting products that are harmful to health , pirating technology and impeding european access to the chinese market .
the us president confirmed that the path ahead of us will be long , requiring more realism than naivety , and that nothing is more important than concrete , feasible steps .
in my opinion , in addition to these pillars , we need to put emphasis on cooperation between both member and non - member states of the european union in the danube river basin .
the commission must not stop there , however .
this is the case for environmental and public health reasons , due to the high levels of pollution associated with it , and for energy reasons related to dwindling oil reserves and growing difficulty of access to this commodity .
anyone who does not agree does not deserve to hear the laughter of children .
these figures do not take into account the european agency for reconstruction , which was closed in 2008 , and on the last discharge of which we will vote today , or rather at a later date in brussels .
i believe that all this will help to create a robust international investment policy in the european union .
just think of the water directive , the groundwater directive , the nitrates directive , the 18 directives relating to cross - compliance .
however , the goal of our demographically ageing society cannot be to spend many years exchanging every second lat earned into euros to pay back the banks , while in the evenings , offering up prayers that the monsieur will hold fast against the euro .
that is why i am confident that if we , as parliaments , are more involved in the implementation of this strategy in the future , we will be able to deliver added value to this partnership .
the vote will take place tomorrow , 31.1.2008 .
mr president , in our opinion , whether to tackle the credit crisis through steadfast compliance with existing community legislation or through some new , stricter regulations is a false dichotomy .
( applause )
indeed , the notion of education and lifelong learning is vital to the competitiveness of the knowledge - based economy .
that is the basis , also , for these reports .
we want to see stability , peace and , of course , democracy in our neighbourhood .
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - ( de ) madam president , we cannot discuss the south caucasus without thinking of our former fellow member ursula schleicher , who cared about this region in a special way and to whom we are grateful for the fact that the colonialist expression ' transcaucasus ' has been replaced by the term ' south caucasus ' .
the sale of alcohol needs to be monitored more closely .
we must applaud the enormous progress already made .
this is a serious mistake .
we are not primarily concerned about the 20 000 who arrived in lampedusa .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the recommendation contained within the report ' framework for the activities of lobbyists in the eu institutions ' .
it also has to be remembered that in the period before 2006 , another eur 1 billion of resources had yet to be recovered and that the court of auditors says that 12 % of the structural funds in 2006 could not be paid out .
the indicator in the worst state is 40 % less than the average , and the difference between the best and the worst states in the uptake of funds is 370 % , i.e. a factor of 3.7 .
however , the lack of a legal personality and problems with the decision - making mechanism weaken this organisation , because it is not always able to respond to crises appropriately or in a timely manner .
( nl ) mr president , commissioner , president - in - office , i should like to thank the commissioner most warmly for her very strong statement .
the european union environment ministers discussed these matters at length last weekend .
however , the report also says , as the chairman of my group , that this cooperation between parliament and the council could be improved , especially in terms of timing .
it is because of this regrettable reference to the lisbon strategy in particular that we have withdrawn our support for this resolution .
the european commission is following events very closely in the public and in the banking sector in greece , so we come to our own conclusions and make proposals to the council on the basis of those conclusions .
what we are seeing within the motor industry is an industrial challenge that is also characteristic of other parts of the european economy .
this means that it is quite possible , at least according to the council 's legal services , that environmental effects will have a weighting of only 1 % , and thus that the impact on the environment will be relatively small .
this common policy must , firstly , involve legal channels for immigration as well as the integration of these immigrants into the host societies .
finally , i would like to say that we must not allow the emergence of proactive risk analyses of patterns of travel and behaviour .
that is enough about the french question , because a decision has been taken by the commission on that matter , but it is not finished and is still an open procedure .
the external action service must enable the eu to implement comprehensive , integrated political strategies and campaigns .
it is a demanding but fair and necessary programme of adjustment .
let us find another - a better - date for this important debate .
it is one of the central initiatives of the europe 2020 strategy .
is it enough if it is merely processed there ?
they only ever short - changed europe 's citizens .
besides , the recent and current global crisis - from food and fuel price shocks to economic instability and climate change - threatens both past achievements and future prospects .
visa liberalisation is intended to benefit the people of these countries , not to reward their politicians .
these are key issues for competitiveness and therefore a key issue for economic growth .
approval of an ilo convention on domestic workers would be a first step in plugging the existing gap , by safeguarding rights in connection with their employment , pay rises , the adoption of criteria for employers or even by clarifying that domestic employees need not necessarily stay in the employer 's home .
i believe that what the president in the chair before you has just done is contrary to the rules of this house and unworthy of this parliament .
this exceptional and global situation requires exceptional and global responses and , in particular , urgent responses .
it is also true , though , that there can be no mutual recognition unless the mutual trust between member states ' legal authorities increases .
we are part of a project that is characterised by its shared and voluntary sovereignty .
there is growth .
the benchmark adopted by the education council in 2003 , to increase by 15 % the number of graduates in member states and decrease gender imbalance by 2010 , has been reached .
the barcelona process : union for the mediterranean ( vote )
the next items are the statements by the council and the commission on the preparations for the european council on 11 and 12 december 2008 .
the uncertain relations that prevail in the ukrainian administration of justice mean that it can take many years for property to be recovered .
increasing energy efficiency is one of the quickest , safest and cheapest ways of reducing eu dependence on third country energy resources , lowering energy consumption and cutting co 2 emissions and the european public 's expenditure on energy bills .
for a long time we were only able to say that , if europe advanced , spain would do so too .
in recent months , though , it has become apparent that the member states have been thwarting this proposal , despite the efforts mr grosch has made as a rapporteur to have a date on the table after all .
it is quite obvious to me that we need money in order to also have compensation outside europe in the latin american countries .
it is not by means of a new tax that we will solve the problem of public finances .
- before the vote on recital c
it is essential that these measures have a direct impact on farmers and not just on each member state 's administration , as has very often been the case .
as mr barrot said , we have to recognise transport 's clear contribution and the need for the ' greening ' of transport .
mr prodi , we have adopted amendment 3 , which therefore replaces the whole resolution .
however , the text of the resolution and the debate on it have again confirmed my belief that public funds should be used to secure basic public services ; other activities , including research and entrepreneurial activities , should be financed from private sources .
' i would like to transmit that the sentiment , the joy , that you spread so respectfully on the streets over the last days now has to be converted into positive and constructive energy in order to move society forward . '
this has all stemmed from belated and inconclusive action taken by the italian government , which has realised that italy is facing a crisis , unfortunately only following terrible incidents perpetrated by eu nationals .
i fully agree with the fact that the european parliament , the only european body directly elected by the people , has played a very important role over the first decade of economic and monetary union .
6 .
last week , i organised a debate in parliament on this topic . it showed how much interest there is in this field , and how many questions are being asked concerning the directive on which the commission is currently working .
or is it instead to be an eu which did admittedly include ambitious objectives in the treaty , but which everyone knows was only playing make - believe ?
it is , therefore , essential to build a common foreign policy , to include a security and energy policy , and therefore also a common policy towards russia .
in the middle east , europe must offer political and financial support for the difficult process of negotiating peace between the israelis and palestinians .
therefore , it can be regarded as an appropriate refinancing instrument .
we can see in the caucasus , we can see everywhere else in the world that the european union is taken seriously for the proposals that it issues .
i am particularly grateful to commissioner verheugen for once again highlighting the ban on animal testing , as it has reminded me that this is now the third revision of the cosmetic products legislation that i have had the privilege to be involved in , these revisions being the sixth amendment , the seventh amendment , and now the change to a regulation .
furthermore , the commission encourages member states to provide further incentives to consumers to stimulate demand for environmentally - friendly products .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , making expulsions secure and discouraging illegality and exploitation : that , in brief , is , in my view , the aim of the ' return ' directive .
therefore , talking about achieving common objectives is our common task , and i think the participation of business in the dialogue will be an effective way of beating competition from around the world .
one of the aspects of this effort would be the establishment of cultural attachés in major capitals around the globe .
in 2007 unusual enthusiasm and determination was displayed in discussions of an economic nature , primarily in negotiations relating to economic partnership agreements ( epas ) , and of course there is nothing wrong with that .
in writing . - ( fr ) i voted for the european parliament resolution on the own - initiative report on a coordinated strategy to improve the fight against fiscal fraud , drafted by british member sharon bowles in response to a commission communication on the subject .
therefore , the more we simplify our procedures and policies , the closer we shall be to what we are striving for , namely cohesion in europe .
the commission as the negotiator for the agreement will certainly be in a better position to update you on the process .
ladies and gentlemen , i am coming to the end of my political career .
then there is the matter of regular checks .
i think that we will have the opportunity to discuss this with him then .
on this basis , i have two questions .
this has become evident ever since certain companies decided to withdraw from the market or recall products that may not have been entirely safe .
in this way , the single market is represented by a european body , which will allow european citizens to be federated around a single project and will strengthen european membership .
this has created certain problems in the discussions with the council .
thank you for your report and for your attention .
the old proposal 's demand was for 25 % of motor vehicles to be green .
the second category could finance the crisis management mechanism , which has become permanent .
these are issues that i do not believe have been entirely clarified .
the report on the implementation of the european security strategy is an annual document by parliament that assesses european security and defence policy and presents proposals to improve the efficiency and visibility of this policy .
in addition , i think it is necessary to provide this country not only with emergency aid , but also with the tools required to stabilise its situation and ensure there is no repetition of this type of event .
there were strong protests .
it has to become possible to protect not only the routes along which humanitarian aid moves , but also community fishing and merchant vessels .
the eu and russia must first of all find a way of consolidating their partnership and of cooperating in the area of security policies , primarily the energy security policy .
we can only stress the fact that water has become a precious and rare resource .
there is obviously mounting public anxiety over the nuclear issue .
nevertheless , at present , such revenue is frequently insufficient to cover the costs of basic public services or to fight poverty .
simplified procedures should be adopted to avoid unnecessary delays for european citizens .
you were the first to open these doors . thanks to you , fifteen of my companions and i found freedom .
i think that , in the specific case of syria , and turkey too , we should call for pressure to be applied , amongst other means , as part of the plans which are apparently going to be put together over the coming days .
we must vigorously defend them .
the institutional engines of european integration will be operating at full power once parliament 's vote of confidence in the new commission gives these two institutions a strong , solid basis in order to move forward with an ambitious political agenda .
the decommissioning will therefore have to carry on , ladies and gentlemen , even after the end of the financial perspective covering the period up to 2013 , and i therefore consider it necessary to consider releasing further funds for the projects to decommission these three nuclear plants .
to return , however , to europe as a partner to others , it is the case that most of the wars in the history of the human family have been about borders , in other words , territory .
that requires very clear rules whereby human trafficking will not result in any sanctions against its victims .
the problem is that the european union produces lots of fine talk on the subject but never puts it into practice .
i worked with - to name a member of the dg - jan on this very important principle , namely that , if you are refused a visa , or you are refused entry into the schengen area , your appeal may not be suspensive , but the authority that refuses must make itself accountable .
this , in combination with the negative - i would say catastrophic - effects for residents and the environment , is a cause for grave concern .
i voted in favour of this resolution because over the past four months , côte d'ivoire has been plunged into a deep political crisis stemming from the refusal of the incumbent president , laurent gbagbo , to relinquish power to the legitimate president , alassane ouattara , despite the fact that the latter won the november 2010 presidential poll and has been recognised as the victor by the international community , following validation of the results by the united nations .
the tragic circumstances of this death should put us all to shame .
why ?
our mental health policy is articulated in a document called a vision for change and many of the calls for action in the rapporteur 's report are stated in our national policy or , indeed , are enshrined in our legislation .
fifthly , the current community financial resources for cohesion policy are insufficient to meet the needs of real convergence and to respond to the regional disparities , high levels of unemployment , income differences and poverty in the european union .
is the commission aware that these new quotas for some areas of the uk has meant some small fleets can only catch one cod per boat each day ?
this measure will only apply in cases where there is an explicit commitment that the enterprises benefiting from it will be included in a restructuring plan within a period of six months .
( the president cut off the speaker )
eu member states should therefore prepare themselves for the imminent revolution in providing societal and assistive services .
as such , parliament should take on a more important role , not just because of the various ways that this confers democratic legitimacy , but also because of what it can offer in material and procedural terms .
the tories , on the other hand , are in total disarray .
i want member states to agree on a 2015 deadline to put an end to energy islands in europe .
hence , on the one hand , there is a duty to provide and , on the other , a duty to assist .
however , we must not hide our heads in the sand .
as far as the individual chapters are concerned , the energy chapter is rather incomplete .
perhaps some enterprising british citizens might like to meet the roma as they disembark at calais and heathrow and give them the addresses and location maps so that they can find their way to the homes of our prime minister , his cabinet colleagues and all the mps in favour of eu membership .
( the sitting was suspended at 13:15 and resumed at 15:00 )
finally , in my previous positions , i was responsible , amongst other things , for the problem of caravans in the netherlands and i have seen how difficult this was to deal with .
this problem is apparent yet again in the audy report and , what is more , it involves yet another unresolved issue , namely , the imbalance in eu funding .
we gave a timely warning of the grievous consequences , and we have , alas , been proved most tragically right .
at that time , the commission lost no time in presenting proposals in this regard , and we also put a few things down on paper - which we now need to refine .
yet we are doing just that : in an extremely serious situation , with a public health crisis and food safety at stake , we are pointing the finger at people who then turn out not to be guilty , thus causing further victims .
action has already been taken on undue or illegal content but also against harmful behaviour or conduct such as grooming or bullying , which have been mentioned .
although turkey has had a presence on european territory for many centuries , it is not , in cultural terms , a european country .
the information collected must be kept confidential and must only be used for the purposes outlined in the law .
as a bridgehead for the south american drug smugglers , guinea - bissau has become a country of transit for drugs which are destined for europe , where we represent the biggest consumer .
the eures portal was launched in 2006 and offers one million job vacancies across europe .
the compromise arises mainly from an attempt to optimise rail transport as a whole while at the same time retaining enough flexibility to resolve crisis situations .
in other words , in addition to the funds already in the travel account .
to do this , we need to retune europe 's political antennae .
there needs to be a fair trial without delay , with all of the guarantees necessary for her to be able to defend herself against the prosecutor 's accusations .
since the millennium goals were formulated , 29 million children have been able to benefit from primary schooling .
should we not have a debate on whether we really need these people , and what we need them for ?
i therefore appreciated the fact that the inter - institutional team charged the commission with reviewing the original list of hazardous substances rather than immediately banning them , which would have a negative impact on smes and on the social and economic situation of the eu .
mr president , would you trust an economic forecaster who had recently said this : ' the euro has done more to enforce budgetary discipline in the rest of europe than any number of exhortations from the imf or the oecd ' ?
the oral question to the commission by sylvie goulard , on behalf of the alde group , on credit rating agencies - b 7-0313/2010 ) .
furthermore , they have to establish a system which determines the competence and responsibility of national authorities in respect of nuclear waste management .
i therefore urge you to vote in favour of the social democrats ' amendments 4 and 10 .
nevertheless , despite its resilience , and as a result of factors largely outside its control , the european automotive sector has been particularly badly hit by the global economic crisis .
and when i see today how anti - terrorism legislation is being used as a cover for political reprisals , i say that now really is the time when we have to support the government and expect it to take another extremely ambitious initiative to emerge from this situation because , as we know , not all the established groups in turkey are interested in a democratic settlement of the kurdish issue .
parliament has , however , accepted an initiative that is diametrically opposed to this , and even goes so far as to regard that as being the political aim of the regulation .
rules for direct support schemes under the cap and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending regulation ( ec ) no 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the european agricultural fund for rural development ( eafrd ) ( vote )
secondly , a directive on orphan works : the objective is to create the necessary legal certainty to support the efforts to digitise our cultural heritage .
i hope that the december european council can give its support to those principles .
now i can hear people on the left and right saying such things as , ' we wanted it differently , ' ' it might be too expensive , ' or ' we do not like it ' .
let us be clear , however : it is not europe , it is not the european commission that created this financial crisis .
currently , free movement is guaranteed on a territory with 42 673 km of external sea and 7 721 km of land borders , covering 25 countries and 400 million citizens .
therefore , the eu must be vigilant and ensure that standards are adhered to and , if not , then action must be taken .
my last words concern cluster bombs , because this was also mentioned .
the electronic exchange of data envisaged in the directive , complete with a guarantee of data protection , will ensure efficient cooperation between countries that enables road traffic offences to be prosecuted as though they were committed in the driver 's home country .
no , europe is not a fortress .
macro - prudential oversight of the financial system and establishment of a european systemic risk board (
it is not by accident that the pact was called the ' stability and growth pact ' .
( pl ) the experiment with a thaw in relations between the union and belarus continues to yield ambiguous results .
are there things that the commission , as guardian of the treaties , can think of that could still be done not only to try and make sure that member states respect their obligations in the future , but how we can still get investigations - including , i very much hope , a proper public inquiry now under the new uk government - to make sure that we know fully what happened in the past and what went wrong ?
soft law should not be a substitute where it is essential to adopt binding community legislation - subject , of course , to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality .
we need to call things as they are , as putin 's russia is probably where hitler 's germany was in the mid - 1930s .
( pt ) the trade agreement signed on 4 november between the european union and israel , which is aimed at liberalising trade in agricultural products , processed agricultural products and fish and fishery products , is unacceptable for various reasons which we will point out here .
one final remark : what pleased me most was your announcement that you intend to come back in the summer of next year as president - in - office of the council .
after all , people must be able to rely on the european union carrying out its core tasks even under difficult circumstances such as we are seeing at present , on it taking matters seriously , and on there being no place in europe for double standards .
as from the march 2010 plenary session , parliament took action , adopting by a very large majority a resolution calling for the fund to be used to provide assistance to the victims .
do people realise that if just one of these 27 ratification processes proved unsuccessful , it would then be difficult to find a plan b for the euro ?
( es ) mr president , given the eu 's dependence on external energy supplies , securing its supply is an issue which must always form part of the eu 's external policy .
however , not all buses can accept both disabled and able - bodied passengers at the same time , and not all buses can be converted to enable them to carry disabled people .
we need to be able to get those humanitarian organisations back on the ground .
( ro ) in many european countries , the procedure for authorising medicines is clear and even well regulated from an official point of view .
the european parliament 's budget consists of more than just these amendments .
they should ask themselves why they need consolidation .
it is , then , a case of disseminating and protecting european values at global level , and of guaranteeing , on the widest possible range of levels , respect for their core aspects , such as freedom of expression on the internet .
in writing . - i voted against the trade relationship between the eu and canada as i feel any bit could undermine the commonwealth negotiation between uk and canada .
first , regarding the question asked by the earl of dartmouth , in a case involving the infringement of intellectual property rights , including patents in third countries , it is appropriate that the operators concerned have recourse to the available enforcement means , including legal proceedings if necessary , as this is a case between two private firms .
in so doing , the european parliament is leaving itself open to the suspicion that it does not want to play a constructive role in the annual budgetary procedure , in accordance with article 234 of the treaty .
nonetheless , it is a step in the right direction .
the creation of unitary patent protection in the community ( now european union ) and ensuring effective patent protection throughout the eu represent a step towards greater eu competitiveness .
therefore , i fully agree with you that this instrument must be used as efficiently and effectively as possible .
at the end of these quite tough discussions , there was a press conference during which president sarkozy and president medvedev set out the six points of the french agreement which then had to be taken back to tbilisi for approval , as amendments had been made between our first trip to tbilisi and what would be our final stay in tbilisi , the next day .
finally , mr president , i would like to add another important comment , which is that the charter and the lisbon treaty strengthen the union as a supranational democracy of states and citizens , and that is the first response in an era of political globalisation .
they are broke .
in this communication the commission set out proposals on reinforcing compliance with the stability and growth pact and deeper fiscal policy coordination .
if the money is not there at the end of the day , there is little we can do in many of these areas .
the public understand much more than some of us imagine that , thanks to the euro and thanks to european integration , there are now sixteen million more jobs in the euro area than there were ten years ago .
without their contribution to society , for which they receive no monetary remuneration , the united kingdom would be a lesser place .
i would therefore like to take the opportunity of asking the commission whether you can clarify this once and for all . must sweden join the emu ?
we believe that it is impossible to clearly define the implications of the draft budget on the strategy 's flagship initiatives , and that more and better information is needed .
your country 's president compared the european union to the soviet union .
it is a valuable tool for reducing our dependence on oil .
china must be forced to comply with international standards in human rights and to respect those rights .
they are appropriate in an instrument intended to match the ambitious european policy to combat illegal immigration .
with regard to our initial experience of the financial crisis i think that small and medium - sized firms , which , by the way , are often unable to obtain necessary loans in times of crisis , should also be brought within the framework of this deposit guarantee directive in order to provide them with at least one way of confronting this crisis .
we can do a great deal together .
last week we observed the international day for the elimination of violence against women .
there are currently 27 energy markets operating in the eu .
in writing . - ( ro ) the main elements of the proposal for directive are :
i should like to express my particular gratitude to the house services .
in general , you could say that they are used to bring about a change in a particular policy or activity .
it must accentuate the social dimension , give priority to the ecosystem and be integrated in the marine policy .
this is a truth well known to skiers , and i think , rapporteur , that you found a way to bring parliament 's strength to the trialogues , in particular on the essential issue of the second stage .
the european union has work to do too .
does the commissioner agree with president barroso , who stated in a letter to prime minister balkenende that revision of the aforementioned directives was not needed but , on the contrary , stability in the relevant legislative framework , and that these directives allowed sufficient room for economic development ?
let us not forget the important agreement reached on article 19 of the framework directive , which gives the commission enhanced harmonisation powers covering general regulatory approaches , including in relation to remedies .
i want to make it clear that i believe that the vast majority of the people of northern ireland do not wish to return now , or any time in the future , to what we went through in the past .
four others went into hiding after being summoned to the ministry of intelligence : hesam misaghi , saeed habibi , navid khanjani and sepeher atefi .
i believe that we now need to take the debate a step further so that we discuss the question of whether it is efficient enough , and so that we also obtain a significantly greater degree of transparency with regard to this .
secondly , i would like to thank all the colleagues who participated in today 's debate for their positive assessment and for their critical remarks .
this must not be postponed until next year .
meanwhile , it is the people and our entire ecosystem that are paying the price for the eurocrats ' complicit silence .
but over the past three or four years , since we began with the presidency of jean - claude juncker , in particular , in january 2005 , the eurogroup has improved the content of the discussion agenda .
in writing . - ( sv ) we swedish social democrats believe first and foremost that taxation policy should be a national matter .
improvements are still required on some points to ensure that croatia can be considered ready for the european union and the objectives enshrined in the europe 2020 strategy : the fight against corruption , protection of minorities , including italian minorities , shortening the duration of judicial proceedings , support for court infrastructure and equipment , strengthening of tax reforms and public spending cuts .
the european legal structure is not effective enough and the european union and member states must do more .
you have also placed three conditions on the provision of this support , which are democratic reform , basic freedoms and legal certainty .
there were those who said ' let us meet the crisis by spending more and accepting bigger deficits ' , and those of us who said ' now we need to be in control of public spending in order to secure stability for the future ' .
it is very gratifying that , within the council , we have been able to agree on a road map for how the procedural rights for suspects and defendants are to be dealt with and implemented step by step .
first and foremost this involves finally sorting out the translation and interpreting resources used in the european parliament .
this year 100 million people were driven into poverty as a result of the food and fuel crisis , and that number continues to grow .
the priority today is to finalise the procedure for the entry into force of the new international tropical timber agreement in 2009 .
secondly , it is important to remember that this is a serious , but not isolated , case of a lack of food security in the eu .
this is normally built into an amendment , but for some reason it got left out .
a better overall view of the research is needed if it is to be possible to save the baltic sea .
today 's ratification of the lisbon treaty in the czech parliament marks a step change for european defence and security .
mr president , i really hope that parliament , the council and the commission can find a way forward for close cooperation on these dossiers .
why was there no effort to ensure that those at the top of the salary scale paid their fair share ?
i believe that the report being discussed will make a significant contribution to the monitoring of the transposition of the regulations stipulated by this directive if member states and the commission can successfully cooperate in this respect .
i hope that during the conference , where i will be representing the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament , we will focus on achieving consistency in terms of development policies and methods for implementing innovative funding mechanisms , with the aim of providing more effective help to those countries which need to be encouraged to implement suitable policies .
the european parliament report ' citizens for europe ' established the action entitled ' active european remembrance ' .
thank you for your attention to this important debate .
it cannot be that we in europe promote basic democratic rights all over the world through the european institutions , while in brussels , in the heart of the european union , these same basic rights are being trodden underfoot .
we must focus on those areas where we can really help in terms of innovation and research .
monitoring the risks relating to the use of pesticides thus means that we need suitable indicators .
( it ) mr president , commissioner , first of all , my congratulations to the rapporteur , mrs wallis , for her work and the contents of her report , with which i am in complete agreement .
in writing . - ukip fully supports equality for men and women .
there is a request to combat violence against women , a request to combat trafficking in women and much more .
- before the vote on paragraph 19
however , i think that we should focus more on solutions .
the oral question to the council by mr markov and mrs mann , on behalf of the committee on international trade , on the stepping - stone economic partnership agreement between the european community and its member states , of the one part , and côte d'ivoire , of the other part - b 6-0217/2009 ) ,

the june list also believes that something needs to be done about the european parliament 's constant shuttling between strasbourg and brussels and that the european economic and social committee and the committee of the regions should be disbanded .
i would like to thank the conference of presidents for unanimously supporting the proposal that we invite young bosniaks and serbs from srebrenica to the european parliament together every year , so that , in a setting away from srebrenica , without the pressures and stresses of their home surroundings , they can think , plan and build a common and more beautiful future for srebrenica and for the whole of bosnia and herzegovina .
we are therefore coming to the conclusion that the new social package will have a limited effect on the lives of european citizens .
finally , commissioner , i would simply like to say that i think it would be positive to combine the idea of increasing quotas by 2 % on a voluntary basis for 2008-2009 , as proposed by the jeggle and goepel reports , with a non - linear increase for subsequent years , as requested in paragraph 84 of the goepel report , in order to distribute the production quotas in a more balanced way , giving priority to member states that have traditionally been in deficit in relation to their internal consumption .
note that under this regulation , the agency in question will be responsible for issuing certificates .

the democratic values of freedom and the right to self - determination must be respected by all peoples .
one should note the difference between the democratic legitimacy of the european parliament , which is based on the vote of the european citizens , and national representativity within the european parliament , which is based on the demographic realities within the member states .

it will , in fact , be crucial over the next few years .

there are a number of important areas that need changing .
the first of these is flexibility in the sense of fully exploiting the options for asymmetric arrangements , timetables and protective measures within world trade organisation rules .
the stability of the current coalition is remarkable despite the difficulties .
a few obstacles remain , however , and it is these obstacles that are being dealt with now .
in my view , independent studies need to be carried out to determine not only the safety of the technology being used , but also the effectiveness ...
with only one case to base such guidelines on , we would risk making bad guidelines that undermine our efforts to help consumers ( that is again something we have in common : we - parliament and the commission - want to help consumers ) .
furthermore , it would be desirable for the european external action service to open new diplomatic missions in these countries .
there are three particularly important agricultural sectors : sugar beets , dairy products and wine production .
in our amendments we have highlighted the importance of giving special consideration to remote and isolated regions .
( el ) mr president , i do not overlook the fact that turkey is a large country which , however , apart from the internal social problems noted in the report , acts - in my opinion - in a contradictory manner in its foreign policy .
we do not have data for anything else as far as measurement per unit is concerned , for example .
in writing . - ( sv ) we voted for the report because it is based on voluntary action and cooperation such as can only be brought about by a reciprocal agreement between two member states .
the report reflects this and urges the commission to ensure that occupational diseases are correctly identified and remedied , with a particular focus on occupational cancers , with a view to setting targets for their reduction .

through the use of démarches and statements , and through our various political dialogues and crisis management operations , the eu is working for improved respect for human rights worldwide .
also , the derogations allowing small abattoirs to be exempted from having the animal welfare officer present are very much to be welcomed .
i have spoken on behalf of us all , and that should be sufficient .
( de ) madam president , doris pack has , as always , submitted an excellent text , because she is not only an expert on southern europe , but also on education .
that will prevent a situation of legal uncertainty in january 2008 .
if the eu calls for the closure of guantánamo , which we more or less did , then let member states put their action where their mouth is .
first , the commission calls on the eu member states to exercise a proportionality test when they call for an arrest warrant , and to fill the gaps where their legislation fails to fully comply with the framework decision setting up the arrest warrant .
mr papandreou , the prime minister , has done everything in his power to get out of this difficult situation .

as many people know , women and men alike , abortion is a painful and harmful intrusion on a woman 's body and soul equally .
the oral question by mrs gebhardt and mr deprez , on behalf of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs , to the commission , on the council regulation amending regulation ( ec ) no 2201/2003 as regards jurisdiction and introducing rules concerning applicable law in matrimonial matters - b 6-0477/2008 ) .
we must be aware that it has been very expensive for some of us , and to ensure we see it through until the end , we need as wide a unity as possible in this parliament on all the aspects of the deal .
currently , armaments are not covered by the rules on the internal market , which means that all such products need to be licensed individually : from simple products such as screws or elements of uniforms , all the way up to highly complex weaponry , everything requires an individual licence .
the eu as a whole is a key producer and user of pharmaceutical products and i was happy to support this report .
the purpose of the dublin agreement is to equip the participating states with criteria designed to establish which state is responsible for examining a request for asylum , thereby ensuring better treatment for applicants and , at the same time , providing the states with tools to fight organised crime .
the european parliament 's request to increase the resources allocated to innovation is absolutely justified in these circumstances .
i am in favour of enhanced governance of europe , and europe needs this enhanced governance .
these amendments have , however , been declared inadmissible and therefore the fundamental change which parliament wishes to make - in other words from an exclusive market orientation to including patients ' rights - is in trouble .
all the speakers talked of lampedusa , but i would like to invite you to reflect on what the kind of migratory process we are experiencing at present really means for an island that lives on tourism and fishing .
it was established in response to concerns over the level of enforcement of international safety standards and on the back of several fatal air crashes over a short space of time in 2004 and 2005 .
international companies are the main players when it comes to applying social standards .
you are lending weight to the arguments of all those who compare the european union to the socialist council for mutual economic assistance , and who liken brussels to moscow .
the country is experiencing a catastrophe and that is the price which laurent gbagbo has had to pay for refusing to admit defeat .
this new entity lacks a budgetary framework , hence the need for this amendment .
however , the national parliaments will have their say and there is a real chance that we will get more referendums than just in ireland .
we welcome the bilateral cooperation measures announced last week by the prime ministers of italy and romania .
( pl ) the report refers to recent changes in serbia .
i am very pleased that you mentioned the baltic sea , and i fully support you in this matter .
the european union must respond robustly to these challenges and this report is our attempt to propose today a number of specific courses of action .
i think parliament can be pleased that it has at least achieved one great step forward in putting in place a financial mechanism which will bring forward the demonstration projects .
the private debt crisis should not simply be traded for public debt .

however , in relation to the school milk scheme , which is vital , can i just give you the views of áine - who happens to be one of my own and who is aged ten .
( fr ) mr president , mrs győri , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , at last we have something to be satisfied about : the toll charge for road transport , which is capped by this new eurovignette directive , may , in the future , include the costs of noise and air pollution .
that includes a healthy environment , and it also includes wholesome food .
the first question is : what should the government do , and what should we leave to the market through tendering ?
i thank the swedish presidency .
according to this agreement , fiscal and other policy interventions should be avoided when responding to high oil prices , as they distort competition and prevent the necessary adjustment by economic agents .
however , there does not appear to be any justification for making all toys subject to the same restrictions as toys intended for babies .
mr president , i would say to the commission and the council to take all the time they need for this directive .
mr president , in my judgement , the introduction of this beautiful high technology here was intended to save our time and increase our efficiency .
mrs mcguinness , as you know , because you are a veteran member of this house , it is the conference of presidents that has decided that the debate should be organised in this way , and so this is how it is being done .
the debate is closed .
it will be the european parliament , so i am not surprised that many in this chamber back the treaty .
first , building political alliances through reinforced dialogue on climate change .
this is hypocritical when the black economy also includes millions of european workers , tradesmen , domestic servants and others and the harmonisation of sanctions must apply to work on the black market irrespective of where the employee comes from .
that is why we shall vote against a reform of this kind .
therefore , the question that arises today , and which our fellow members have just asked , is this : are we going to develop the neighbourhood policy as part of our foreign policy ?
at the council meeting last week in the discussion of the treaty of lisbon , a commitment was given by the council to strengthen workers ' rights .
indeed , i agree that possible new consumer rights need to be introduced into the ongoing legislative process and that the purpose of the charter is to better communicate on energy consumer rights and thus render them more well - known with consumers .
yet , in the face of this extreme adversity , there are weak acts of defiance , and hope for freedom of speech and democracy .
imagine a mother sitting with her children and reading them a good - night story .
at the beginning the father also took care of that young boy or girl .
following the relevant expert evaluations , and in spite of the fact that there are still some problems to be resolved , both countries have shown they are prepared to implement the provisions of the schengen acquis and can therefore fully accede to it .
what are we doing to achieve food security ?
restricting the role of an institution like the european parliament is wrong .
the european union has so far not taken any steps aimed at coordinating international action and is simulating combating terrorism in a virtual - cum - verbal sphere .
economic recovery , the future of employment , the competitiveness of our countries , all these depend on the development of employees ' skills , as it is they who set the standards for our businesses .
this situation will have benefits both for the banking sector and for consumers .
in spite of that , the croatian assembly decided unilaterally last year that the environmental / fishing zone would affect the member states as well from 1 january of this year at the latest .
it was intended to identify those areas and sectors where we should like to develop closer relations with brazil .
indeed , i have dedicated , as i say , part of my work , part of the work of the spanish presidency of the council , to working on the gender perspective of the new growth and employment strategy , the eu 2020 strategy , which will foreseeably be adopted this thursday , 17 july .
originally , the three countries of the south caucasus were excluded from the european neighbourhood policy and were only included in the action radius of the neighbourhood policy .
from this perspective , i have endorsed the idea of voting against paragraph 5 , introduced by an amendment of mine tabled in committee , to emphasise that the appointment of the 18 new members will have to comply as far as possible with the provisions of the 1976 electoral act , which requires that members be elected directly by the european citizens .
what is especially worrying about the council 's cuts has been the fact that they are targeted , among other things , at research and development , as mentioned previously .
i agree with mrs fajon that ordinary people from this area should not be hostages to the current political situation but , at the same time , it is necessary to formulate the decision on free movement for kosovars clearly in such a way that their leaders do not begin to interpret it erroneously as a de facto recognition of their declaration of statehood .
like the mongols of outer mongolia , the uyghurs or the turkmen people of xinjiang , tibet is suffering this oppression that seeks to destroy its identity .
now , we have been told that there will be no urgent matters in march ii because , according to the rules , when there are two plenary sessions in the same month , there can be no urgent matters in the second .
gender equality and respect for the principle of nondiscrimination in general are basic preconditions to active inclusion in the labour market and the social integration which must accompany it .
the council has not debated it .
but when we raise a region up , it is the competitiveness of all of europe that is increased , and we grow stronger and better in the face of global competition , assuming , of course , that the member states take advantage of the opportunities , the money does not remain unused and moreover , the money spent brings results .
furthermore , we need to reinforce our citizens ' rights in , for example , the protection of victims of crime .
common union legislation would be very helpful to us in our endeavours , however .
( de ) then i should just like to personally invite mr von wogau once more to disclose with whom his law firm does business and from whom it derives its profits , and then we can continue to talk .
we are following this very closely , and europol , together with the national authorities , is doing its utmost to try to combat this increasing crime .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( el ) mr president , we in the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left do not wish to enter into the spirit of celebration , because we know full well that social europe is not one of the commission 's or the council 's priorities .
planning effective legislative measures , prevention and education all have a key role to play in such a strategy .
all of us on the centre - right want to find practical ways of helping to stamp it out , and indeed would support , in principle , a specific directive to help people with disabilities as currently being considered by the commission .
from the outset , it was obvious to me that it is no simple matter to strike the right balance between the requirements of a well - functioning internal market , the justified safety concerns of citizens about the illegal use of firearms and the understandable desire of hunters and sports marksmen to pursue their hobbies largely unhindered .
i intend to make this a regular feature of the european council meetings .
here i shall quote the chairman of the socialist group in the european parliament , martin schulz : ' europe cannot successfully compete with other regions of the world on low wages and social standards , but on technological innovations , higher quality of work and the competence and knowledge of its people . '
these problems have already been mentioned and mainly relate to the division of power between local authorities , national authorities and authorities at european level .
i hope that my fellow members realise exactly what they are doing .
europe 's positions on israel , palestine and iraq arouse great opposition in the middle east , where europe is suspected of focusing primarily on its own energy supplies , on safeguarding its own transport routes and on giving preferential treatment to those ethnic or religious minorities best disposed towards it .
it is important to recall , in this connection , that the purpose of the recent cap reforms was to make agriculture in the european union more efficient and competitive , but at the same time to ensure its sustainability .
it was she who submitted to the pakistani parliament a draft of amendments to legislation on punishments for blasphemy .
is it not paradoxical that we give most of the money in agriculture to those whose production is expensive ?
in wales we fully appreciate the eu funds received and all my constituents appreciate the need for a stable eurozone .
we are convinced that a fruitful dialogue between the european parliament and the parliaments of the member countries of the gulf cooperation council will serve to strengthen cooperation between the european union and the gulf cooperation council and thus encourage a swift and successful conclusion to the free trade agreement negotiations .
the secondary aims of this directive are , however , very good .
it is through these organisations that consumers gain strength and acquire more knowledge and information .
however , i believe that , in this respect , the investment should be made in the fields of solar energy and carbon capture and storage .
however , more specifically let me say that the proposed ad hoc instrument to which i will come to soon will be designed in such a way as to set criteria that are needs - based and do not follow the eff so that , for example , the requirements of those who have already undertaken substantial restructurings are recognised and that those who have low eff allocations are also recognised .
i would ask those members who advocate that the directive should apply to all to apply it to themselves and to have a tachograph installed in their own cars - and then not to use their cars on thursday evening when they go home after working here for 15 hours .
this proposal was designed to provide an interim response to the victims of maritime pollution prior to the constantly delayed implementation of the international conventions that are pending .
china has set its currency at an artificially low level to make its goods cheaper still .
legal and judicial protection of private investment is one of the keys to africa 's economic and social development .
we must not compel businesses at all costs to transport their goods by train or boat instead of by road freight - that would be absurd and anti - economic .
if blogs are not to degenerate into anonymous sources of libel , we need to think about how to deal with breaches of privacy or the right of reply , for example .
i hope that i , as rapporteur , will be able to produce as good a report on the vat carrousels as my report on cigarette fraud .
our excellent opinion gives us an opportunity to take concrete measures to deal with this .
at the same time , our hope will only be justified if we ourselves are prepared to direct resources into implementing this plan , because kyrgyzstan 's struggling economy cannot afford the necessary support for carrying out the long - awaited social , economic and political reforms .
mrs lulling asked a very specific question .
the eit would seem a splendid project , therefore - if it were not for the inadequate financial arrangements .
monocultures , the felling of rainforests and competition with food and feed crops , which has contributed to the current food crisis , have seemingly prompted the eu ministers to think again and have dealt a blow to their target of increasing the share of renewables in the production of motor fuel to 10 % by 2020 .
that promise was repeated in their annual policy strategy for 2008 .
neither hydropower nor today 's alternative energy sources are capable of meeting our supply needs .
building on this work , the commission will present a european union framework for national roma integration strategies in april .
i think it is very important for farmers right now that a clear signal be sent to them as to what is likely to happen , so that they will not be left to wild speculation , not knowing whether to buy or sell stock based on the historic model .
biogas is an important renewable energy resource which contributes to sustainable agricultural development and improves the state of the environment .
as far as i am concerned , the compromise we have reached is a good compromise and we must seek to hold onto it as far as possible .
i refer , for example , to a recent report by amnesty international about the human rights situation and the treatment of minorities .
, in writing . - the irish government 's jobs initiative has correctly concentrated on the jobs - rich sector of tourism ; while the eu 's small business act has the potential to complement this in the area of smes over the coming years .
this is an important issue , and i think that the main contribution that this european year will make will be that creativity , innovation and new ways of thinking will become the core of the debate .
we must prune the tree in order to allow growth .
that was the underlying idea of the strategy .
the only thing it can serve as an example of from now on is as a warning : a warning of how , thanks to political folly , a wonderful , efficient and successful industrial sector in a country can be destroyed .
it is really they who are the major beneficiaries of the agreement .
a european regulation must strengthen this responsibility on the part of the member states , as well as requiring them all to use the same procedure .
it brings us back to the 1970s and political correctness and is very naive in that element .
shame on them and shame on the brutal mullahs .
it is little wonder , because the common fisheries policy currently constituted has seen the destruction of our fleet but has not seen the build - up of fish stocks .
the women in rural areas should benefit from enhanced access to education and lifelong learning , as well as to opportunities to reconcile family life with professional life .
with the crises , and this is to your credit , we never said that you were a man of dishonour , we merely said that , seeing the way in which you , mr barroso , have led this commission , we do not have faith in you .
of the 15 old member states , the per capita debt of the population in 12 member states exceeds eur 16 000 , which accounts for 90 % of the average annual family income .
that has been the key strategy .
both of these areas are currently under threat in the media sector .
i would ask you if , in your concluding comments , you could address some of those very real issues , so that people realise that they are being discussed .
we intend to put the issue of credit default swaps to the g 20 in june .
it strikes me , as it did the people i met at michelin , that this fund needs to be put in place as soon as possible .
could you not have let us know earlier or intervened , so that we could all take the floor ?
for instance , in france between 2006 and 2007 , aid to africa actually declined .
i therefore believe that the first thing to do is to use the resources that we already have at our disposal .
closure of the sitting
there is only one requirement to be met before the council can take a decision , which is planned for december 2007 , on the full application of the provisions of the schengen acquis in the new member states .
mr kelly , from a strictly legal point of view , the treaty of lisbon brings with it a change , in that it deems tourism to be a third - level competence of the community , in other words , the community may act to supplement the activities of the member states but cannot put forward any harmonising legislation in this field .
that is why i tabled amendments to that effect , which were adopted by the committee on culture and education .
it is regrettable that the resolution has come much later than the statements by certain heads of state and un officials about the deployment of tens of thousands of us troops in the country .
last year the leader of the social democratic group said , ' i believe hein - christian strache is a nazi ' .
the problem can be partially solved by benchmarking .
the only question is knowing whether it is reasonable .
- before the vote on paragraph 2 ( c ) of the annex :
mr president , tax fraud is a crime that not only robs governments , but also robs every single taxpayer - every single citizen who does pay their tax on time .
i am thinking here of support for civil society and for democratic and institutional reforms , and guaranteeing europe 's energy security .
europe will only be able to develop sustainably in areas such as environmental protection , industry and energy supplies , and to conquer global markets , if it can make the best technologies even better .
more than one million myanmar citizens constitute an important part of the workforce in thailand in the agricultural sector , in textiles and in the tourism sector .
the commission was in touch with the un under - secretary general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordination , baroness amos .
ladies and gentlemen , parliament 's voice must be heard .
let me be very clear on this so there is no room for ambiguity .
from our point of view , an urban agenda should prioritise better distribution of the population in the territory of certain countries , particularly in portugal , relieving the cities by valuing rural areas and properly remunerated farming ; spreading productive activity across the country ; valuing quality public services in rural and urban areas ; combating unemployment ; defending jobs with rights ; valuing salaries and pensions ; and combating poverty .
europe must and will propose ideas .
we were the vanguard of freedom , even right next to franco , and anyway it was not necessary to talk about borders because they were drawn by an iron curtain .
the commission informed me that what we were talking about was , for instance , nanotechnology and meat from cloned animals .
of course , the european parliament demands that the commission be fully transparent in all negotiations and that we be provided with timely sectoral impact assessments .
the railways , which are already two centuries old , are becoming more important in today 's world because of environmental protection as well as congestion on the roads .
with this in mind , a fundamental revision of the procedures directive is absolutely vital , so as to provide an accessible , fair and effective procedure , as much in the interests of asylum seekers as in those of the member states .
i look forward to your debate .
the whole of this discussion has taken place as if the euro were of no global importance .
so while we endorse the long term goals , we cannot endorse the means and have voted against those reports which do not confine themselves to the eurozone .
this would still be supporting the european parliament , which expressed itself here in the debate and in the vote that took place on the report , for which i had the honour to be the rapporteur , on the eu 's negotiations with mercosur , which was adopted a year ago , and to which i refer .
my third question concerns pension funds .
it is well known that smes play an important role in the european economy , providing approximately 100 million jobs , and representing a major source of income for member states and the regions .
i would like to thank the egf for providing assistance which is selected very carefully and is socially responsible .
on the other hand , we know very well that it needs nuclear energy to make the bomb .
the first is that there is no mathematical link between the length of maternity leave and women 's fertility rate , and to prove it i need only mention the situation in france , since france is a country which provides for 14 weeks ' maternity leave and which , today , has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
the key question that this report attempts to answer is the following : how can we strengthen and effectively implement the european policy of regional cooperation in the black sea region in order to achieve the objective of creating a common space of security , democracy and prosperity ?
as the commissioner said , assistance has been sought from the european union since august .
the eu wants to help support pakistan 's civil institutions .
in particular , it contains an indepth study of the problems associated with our current relationship .
i am certain that we can only develop the internal market further if we coordinate all our national economies .
now you can see the bitter result .
the discussions in advance of this report were always very fruitful and interesting .
( fr ) it is an addition .
( pl ) mr president , referring back to two speeches by my fellow members , i would like to comment on the elections in russia .
so while i broadly accept what is a good report , i think we must be careful , as we make progress on standards in europe , that we also have the same standards for imports .
china can become truly great only by showing respect towards its minorities .
that will help turkey reform and ensure that individual freedoms are guaranteed and the rule of law is established .
in fact , i , together with vice - president wallström and the whole college , are working on this .
thus , i consider that the danube represents a potential to be turned to good account with a view to building a logistic corridor linking the black sea region , europe 's eastern gate , with western europe .
this was the subject of a joint statement which we approved at our conciliation meeting and i can assure you that the council attaches the greatest political importance to ensuring that all operational programmes and projects are executed as rapidly as possible and in an appropriate manner .
the report moreover provides an all - round approach to tourism in the coastal regions as it includes issues such as the marine and coastal environments , sea transport , employment in the coastal regions , support for small and medium - sized enterprises and support for fishing .
it is true that it promotes the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons and the control of all weapons .
fishing bosses no longer want to invest in their boats so the fleet is ageing .
we want a global agreement and we also want to include in it flights from third countries .
in this context , the alternative to russian gas , the nabucco project , becomes an absolute necessity .
we have had our battles along the way , but most of the time we have fought together in the spirit of cooperation which pervades work in the committee on budgets .
my question to the council was therefore : how long will the council continue to put up with this ?
added to this technological development time lag are the effects of the economic crisis , which has hit this industrial sector hard , causing a 20-25 % fall in its turnover compared with 2008 .
if the pictures that we have seen are accurate , then this must give rise not just to serious debate , but also , if necessary , to consequences .
ladies and gentlemen , recently , the european commission has noted a significant rise in beef imports from third countries , in particular , from argentina , brazil and uruguay .
it cannot be just service companies : it should be all companies of all sizes .
meanwhile , as i myself have put forward , we need to pursue a reduction in vat across the eu as a whole in the case of cultural goods , such as cds .
experts from the european centre for disease prevention and control have been deployed by dg sanco to assess the best way to reinforce epidemiological surveillance in haiti , and further cooperation is under consideration .
indeed , gilad shalit 's father noam has repeatedly confirmed that neither he nor his family is involved in politics .
secondly , the motor industry financial institutions must be safeguarded .
( ro ) the legislative provisions we are discussing today could improve the lives of more than one million european citizens working in another member state as suppliers of services or posted workers .
if we read the lead articles in any conservative newspaper today , whether it be the financial times or the frankfurter allgemeine , the headlines could have been written by socialist groups in this house , but not by the commission president and certainly not by mr mccreevy .
however , the issue of pre - authorisation is of concern to me .
within the eu , the free movement of goods and people is essential for our growth and also demonstrates our solidarity .
for these imperious reasons , we support the establishment of the european criminal records information system insofar as it will guarantee each person 's fundamental freedoms .
with regard to the resolution on the commission 's enlargement strategy paper for 2009 , we would like to make it clear , on behalf of the spanish delegation of the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) , that the fact that we supported it overall does not in any way mean that we agree with the recognition of kosovo as an independent state .
furthermore , we are allowing our supply businesses , hard hit , as they have been , by the economic crisis , a sufficient transitional period to get to grips with the high level of requirements made of them .
the agreement on co 2 emissions from cars is a bow to the car industry and it only serves to confirm that the eu 's promises in relation to climate change are not worth the paper they are written on .
you have one of the most difficult portfolios to deal with .
i would like to call on parliament for its support in this regard .
mr president , as is only right , i would like to congratulate our rapporteur not only on her work but , most of all , on her ability to listen .
i fully agree that this is a completely different debate but we have an allocated time of two minutes , so i am free to give time to two people .
it is simply paying our respects to the victims of a totalitarian system .
that runs contrary to a unanimous decision adopted in the committee on constitutional affairs .
perhaps it should also be said that those who expected the european parliament to announce an end to eu enlargement and to introduce some substitute for full accession have been disappointed .
this resolution only goes as far as calling on the commission and the council ' to take all necessary steps to ensure a level playing field ' .
in recent years , we have had a rapid increase in energy prices and the european citizens are expecting an answer to their problems from the european institutions .
i therefore believe that it is essential to find solutions in order to narrow this gap , thereby demonstrating that the main purpose of the eu is the well - being of its people .
we do not have the role of changing them .
articles 6 and 7 of the treaties have been invoked here today .
democracy is vital .
written statements ( rule 142 )
( lt ) as many of you have mentioned , energy saving is the most economical way to ensure energy security and limit the amount of carbon dioxide emissions .
mr president , today we have yet another debate in parliament on the way italy deals with the roma population .
it would not be so difficult .
in writing . - i support the directive on temporary agency work .
now , the consumer acquis already sets out a number of obligations for cross - border service providers .
there is a lot at stake .
regrettably , these issues are forgotten further on : the proposals necessary to correct these situations are not made .
this is necessary for judicial cooperation and it is a condition for the vital mutual confidence among the member states .
one hundred and fifty years ago , bulgarian farmers were able to feed the most densely populated regions of the ottoman empire in asia minor using 19th century technology .
i urge the member states to take the new youth strategy seriously and implement the proposed measures vigorously .
hopefully , we will be able to have a better assessment some time soon .
our efforts must concentrate on increasing respect for human rights and law and order , building a state of law and integrating afghanistan fully into the international community .
i turn now most importantly , if i may say so , to the oral question that you put and which clearly poses the whole problem of pnr .
the complaint made by the environmental lobby that the package has been watered down frankly seems unreasonable to me , when we consider that targets are being observed and industrial sectors have a declining emissions ceiling .
this means channelling our aid , preferably as budget support ( provided that the basic criteria are fulfilled ) .
we need a common strategy focused on prevention through education that expands information policies , increases family planning efforts and facilitates access to contraception .
in this way , the billions of euro will be applied , firstly , as intended ; secondly , in compliance with deadlines ; and , thirdly , in the interests of citizens , and not in the interests of individual civil servants and political groupings .
however , for the court to be credible , it must really be very scrupulous , because the court is saying , today , that it is glad the glass is 95 % full , while i think many taxpayers will ask : ' but why is it 5 % empty ? '
in writing . - this report , adopted unanimously in the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , is some kind of contribution by parliament to the revision of directive 2001/95 / ec on general product safety .
then there is an idea of perfectibility , or room for improvement , which has been alluded to by members who , although sympathetic to the circumstances to which we have adapted , want the area of rights to be further expanded , to cover urban transport and to protect passengers with reduced mobility .
it had realised that this was an historic moment it had to seize in order to reunite europe .
workers ' rights issues arising from the laval and other judgments must be comprehensively addressed .
it is also very important to support the development of the euro area and to take appropriate measures to create suitable conditions for member states aiming to become members of the euro area .
i would , however , like the future european commission proposal on the principle of reciprocity to contribute in particular to the opening of the procurement markets of third countries , and not just to restrict access for businesses from third countries to public procurement markets in the european union , which might have an adverse effect on competitiveness in the union market .
35 .
mr president , deceit is a weapon of war approved of in the koran under the doctrine of taqiyya .
this new legislative framework will allow us to ensure the same degree of protection in both cases when women are self - employed and when they are only spouses and partners of self - employed workers .
people in long - term possession of large funds to put on deposit can do this and make the deposit safe by splitting it between institutions , but it is unrealistic to ask that lump - sum payments be channelled that way .
therefore , i consider it particularly unacceptable that , as early as the first paragraphs , the present report wags a finger at people who dare to ask questions - justified questions - about the magnitude of the european union 's contribution and about the benefit of much of the european union 's expenditure .
our opinion was very clear , which is that we fully support the creation of the european stabilisation mechanism and see it as a very important part of the mosaic for a stronger and more economically prosperous europe .
back in may 2007 , a leaked report from the us embassy there had called for an urgent end to delta holding 's monopoly , both in serbia 's own interests and for the sake of the country 's european integration .
one issue of particular concern to me is highlighting the specific situation of girls and women with a migration background .
the member states are faced with the task of facilitating supervision and assistance in respect of the establishment of cooperation and the exchange of information between schools , training institutions , research centres and businesses .
there is a solution .
recommendation by yannick jadot , on behalf of the committee on international trade
and , in the longer term , the high - level group that i have announced should lay the ground for building consensus on cross - border supervision .
this is the only way we can support women and oppose society 's acceptance of domestic violence and the impunity of those who commit this crime .
that is why i believe it is important , commissioner , that your strategy addresses these challenges efficiently and effectively and provides responses .
neither can it be verified theoretically .
this agreement removes that barrier through the accession of the principality of liechtenstein to schengen .
for example , i was the rapporteur recently on the waste framework directive .
with great cynicism , his commission has sent employees of the commission into schools all over ireland in recent days to speak , supposedly , of how good the commission of the european union is - in reality a signal to their parents that they should vote ' yes ' for lisbon .
checks on food will be made even more difficult because large multinationals are using monopolies to hide behind in order to avoid any responsibility while carrying on activities that are dangerous and very damaging to public health .
perhaps you think i am naive , but i am not alone .
it is noteworthy that on this occasion , in marked contrast to the madness of the nearby burmese regime , china is showing an openness to assistance and international aid .
at masters level , they can approach interdisciplinary knowledge about the economy in a developing world with flexibility , while at doctoral level , they provide innovative solutions .
a good and effective system of scientific research management at european level is therefore essential .
i think that it is our duty to prevent the loss of human life .
the most important factor of a control system applied to 27 member states is probably that all stakeholders should be treated equally and , in particular , that everyone along the production chain - fishermen , middlemen , buyers , people who have links to recreational fishing and others - should feel that they are not being discriminated against but also that they have their share of the responsibility on this matter .
i believe also that we should lift the ban on the people 's mujahedin , and we should do that as soon as possible .
after this , the government set up an independent committee , whose reports are available on a wide range of websites , including in english . this committee made suggestions and numerous court proceedings were also initiated .
it is good and important for us to make progress in this area .
however , europe is at a turning point if it does not find a new modus operandi . the events of the past weeks with regard to the greek crisis - and here i would disagree with mr gauzès , since unfortunately , the european union and the member states , and especially mrs merkel , have been late in responding to this situation - mean that europe is at a turning point .
the issue of equal opportunities must be resolved , and we have to make progress in this respect , as well , but not in this directive .
the obligation to consult the schengen information service during the processing of requests for long - stay visas is the same procedure as the one which already exists for nationals of third countries who are holders of residence permits .
disputes over competence must be resolved in accordance with the principle of equality and the principle of cooperation .
in writing . - ( ro ) the new directive is a balanced agreement offering benefits such as the right recognised at eu level of consumers to change their mind in the two weeks after they have received the item they ordered and the obligation for online traders to provide full information about the total price and the trader 's contact details .
creating more and better jobs is in our hands .
today in europe 54 % of all aircraft ramp inspections concern european operators .
farmers should not therefore fear this limit , because it will oblige the processing industry to locate itself nearer the places where the animals have been reared .
moving to the question raised about transparency , the commission is about to launch a web portal that should start to operate around may - june 2008 on the question of broadband and the citizens .
road safety : stands for two - wheel motor vehicles ( vote )
of course , we would like to have the new treaty approved as soon as possible .
mr booth , this is not a fiasco .
this is not the case with just one area .
i agree with the very important call for the international community , as well as the eu , to make a firm and long - term commitment to immediately make good all their promises , because more than a million people are living in what were supposed to be temporary makeshift camps and human rights organisations report that living conditions in these camps without facilities are terrible and women ' face the risk of rape and sexual violence ' .
some of them sell online , some travel to another country for services , and sometimes the service provider visits the customer 's home country .
we had problems with certain member states .
one of the long - term tasks of this strategy has been to promote sustainable development , but we have not been able to achieve this .
i very much hope , however , that the amendments to reject the commission 's entire proposal will not gain a majority tomorrow .
it is important that citizens should be able to monitor proceedings that are of interest to them and access all documents from one location .
i thought that you wanted to put an item on the agenda .
clearly give references to documents .
however , we know only too well today that , on issues such as cabotage , social conditions in the various countries are such that , were it to be systematised , we could , as things stand , see a number of workers from countries with high levels of pay ejected , ousted from the market by countries with low levels of pay .
according to international law , these persons must be escorted to the nearest port , and as vicepresident barrot said at the time of the first incident , the closest port of call in this case is that of lampedusa .
the report asked for reform of international aid , elimination of opium poppy cultivation , better coordination of police training , and support for the peace process .
the hungarian presidency will do everything in its power to this end .
the debate is closed .
i voted for this regulation because i consider that it is a welcome improvement to a previous measure which restricted the rights of long - stay visa holders in a member state .
there is no point in going over the context of this resolution , it was totally obvious .
this decision of moody 's seems inconsistent with the evolution of greek sovereign bond deals and cds spreads , which have narrowed significantly since the agreement on the programme .
we must now ensure that this is recognised as a right for all seafarers and have employers finance it .
( the speaker agreed to take a blue card question under rule 149(8 ) )
i would like to assure you that the presidency will pay great attention to this issue and will keep you fully informed of the outcome of further discussions in the council , as well as any other developments .
this is a serious matter .
this technology is based on developments in genetics going back a good half - century .
i was happy to back the report by heide rühle calling for a simplification of public procurement .
successes like the invention by the romanian raluca - ioana van stade , which is a sensor that can determine the presence of cancer in the human body at molecular level , directly from a person 's blood , using a simple procedure lasting less than six minutes , must be supported and capitalised on to the full .
the major problem with the european energy strategy is that it was not built from scratch , but is rooted in each country 's own geography , history and energy economics .
we cannot talk in generalised terms about the overcapacity or the overfishing or the lack of compliance .
baroness ashton ran cnd and still refuses to tell us whether she took money from the communist party of great britain .
wine , wheat , peace !
finally , i wish to thank in particular the representatives of the portuguese presidency for their excellent work .
wall street and city survivors are speculating on the currency markets and short selling cdss that they do not even have .
what is the situation going to be when increased discharges from the incineration plant will be allowed into the atmosphere ?
this was done in a responsible manner too , which means that it provides the highest possible level of safety for consumers .
in other words : the best policy with regard to the arctic would be for the eu to get involved on the sidelines only .
any doubters can look at the policy of the centre - right government in my home country , sweden , if i can be allowed to be a little patriotic at the end of this debate .
much more needs to be done , given that 40 % of the world 's most undernourished children live in india .
people fresh from the tragedy of aquila , but here we had the navy , we had the fire fighters , we had ngos , we had civilians , we had doctors , we had psychiatrists , we had dentists , we had nurses , all working under the umbrella of the commander , actually , of the ship who had a hospital ship full of people who were being treated from the direct consequences of the earthquake .
we are voting against the eu 's proposals for a ' health check ' of the cap.
we must therefore better define the operational structure of the institutions of the union for the mediterranean , providing the secretariat with financial resources and with criteria for membership and for implementing projects .
in writing . - ( fr ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the european union is not done with disowning hyper - president sarkozy : rejection of the proposals on fuel tax , warnings against the budgetary slides and , now , transformation of the proposed union for the mediterranean into a re - launch of the barcelona process , which has been a failure for more than 10 years .
it damages confidence when a government subjects its banks to a stress test in the summer and only a few months later realises that it was really a stress test for the euro and not for the banks .
if i am mistaken , i would be very grateful for a written reply on the suitability or inadequacy of the scheme i have proposed .
i hope that you can confirm this again today .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( fr ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the sole objective of this report and today 's discussions is simply to conceal a glaring reality in the european union : industry is in crisis and the damage being caused is substantial .
that is what i understand the innovation union is offering .
democracies can be built with extremely diverse parties .
you have already heard from two members of my group who have differing views on this and i think you will see tomorrow that the position of our group will be against this - unless some of the amendments that my colleagues have proposed are voted through .
along with others , i voted for the amendments limiting the directive to 67 airports ( compared to around 150 which would have been affected before ) .
therefore , mr orbán , i hope that the good european - ness in you continues to develop positively and that there will also be positive hungarian - ness in you .
i voted in favour of this report because i join the chorus of disappointment in parliament at the european union 's lack of a genuinely global and uniform post - lisbon approach to the common security policy .
this creates unequal conditions for the new member states and discriminates against them .
however , i fear that the author is on the wrong track with her plans to achieve this goal of cost reduction by introducing numerous additional provisions .
only eu fruit is to be provided , for example bananas from remote regions .
unfortunately , it provides almost no development support for either of the two states .
in this union of free movement , the only remaining barriers are those of our political debates .
the way the report has now been drawn up provides good conditions for achieving these goals .
finally , i should like to ask the commission why mr ganley 's campaign in ireland produced better results than the campaign undertaken by the irish government and the european union regarding the lisbon treaty ?
circumstances are changing constantly , however , and due to the unrest and wars in north africa , europe 's southern borders are now under increased pressure from thousands of refugees .
as part of efforts to promote and highlight european culture , in 2007 , the european union adopted the culture programme which will run until 2013 .
we call upon the heads of state or government who are meeting this evening to prepare for the g 20 to place the issue of the dairy crisis on the agenda for their meeting , so that appropriate steps can be taken to respond to livestock farmers .
everyone is free to make their own choice .
i would ask commissioner špidla if this amendment can apply from 1 may 2009 , provided that tomorrow we have the large majority needed to adopt this proposal at first reading .
what is needed is not complaints , however , but effective cooperation to tackle the current crisis in a constructive and far - sighted manner .
to start with , a joint action to combat trafficking in human beings was adopted in 1997 .
the deleted text read as follows :
in poland , for example , there has been an increase in vat which means that the cost of family maintenance has gone up .
it should also be underlined that the restructuring plans submitted on 12 september - and i am talking about the plans of the polish government - foresee job reductions of approximately 40 % .
i can say , on this subject , that the european union is working on such preventive measures .
we cannot afford to compromise here .
on the other hand - and you also referred to the legal position - are we in the european union really justified in arrogating legislative or contractual powers to ourselves on every issue that deeply concerns anyone in the eu ?
now , regarding the future president of the council , i am not going to comment .
an excellent opportunity will present itself next week at the informal meeting of heads of state and government with the us president in prague .
we will continue the assistance that is already ongoing , notably in the fields of human rights , education and poverty eradication .
as such , we are not aiming in every direction , but instead wish to focus our attention on this issue .
the approximation will continue in 2012 and 2015 .
nevertheless , those who take a more fundamentalist view are entitled to be reassured that ' organic ' really is organic , and not just a label used to extract a price premium from gullible and ill - informed consumers .
we have included in our resolution a whole list of people whom , i believe , lady ashton must mention whenever she has the opportunity .
in the rapporteur 's view , the objectives of the new regulation on novel foods are to attain a high level of food safety , consumer protection , environmental protection and protection of animal health , while at all times observing the precautionary principle , as laid down in regulation ( ec ) no 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law , establishing the european food safety authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety .
for this reason , mr president , and for other reasons which i shall mention in my second speech , it is worth us granting the visa exemption to taiwan , as the united kingdom and ireland did last year .
now that is being realistic .
if asked how the crisis is affecting their economies , developing countries reply that it has brought a downturn in trade leading to lower economic growth , restrictions on output and higher levels of unemployment .
i call on the political forces within the country to guarantee political order and stability following the elections .
firstly , i should be happier if those members who delivered impassioned speeches for the whole world to hear would at least stay in the chamber for the rest of the debate .
there is a consensus on how to assess the anthropogenic influence ; that is covered in article 3 .
it is our political and moral duty to support the people of georgia and to make russia understand that the time when it could act at will in its self - proclaimed sphere of influence has gone forever .
i have no intention of reprising the arguments we have just heard from my three honourable friends : it makes no economic sense ; it makes no technical sense ; we are getting free use of the american gps .
i have said that on these questions mr gollnisch has asked for a point of order .
the third point is , of course , safety , and safety certification has to be a prerequisite for obtaining a licence to operate .
this is why european institutions must promote new dynamic labour market policies as soon as possible .
we would have liked to have seen a few different figures in parts of the agriculture budget .
our target group for this information is quite different , after all - it is not those who already have an excellent knowledge of how healthy different foods are .
we need that information .
i would like to express my sincere thanks to her .
thus , it is in our interest to ensure that immigration takes place legally , under regulated circumstances , and that member states have the possibility to monitor the process , while immigrants experience legal certainty , meaning that there should be no advantages to be gained from circumventing legal procedures .
in addition , the eu has important experiences to share when it comes to overcoming conflict and building stability through shared interest and mutual understanding .
on one side it is a direct neighbour of the european union and , on the other , ukraine could be an important bridge between the eu , russia and the countries of central asia .
i look to the day that we will work , not only for greater equality in the workplace , but to empower women to make a free choice and to feel strong enough to achieve their goals .
president in office . - ( sl ) thank you , mr rack , for this additional question .
these are mainly points indicating the need to protect children and youths from negative advertising .
member of the commission . - reports by the wto and the commission 's own monitoring show that there is no imminent risk of a generalised protectionist escalation .
25 .
the routines of agriculture are not determined by fixed hours but have to adjust to seasonal requirements , vegetative periods and the possible presence of livestock .
in conclusion , mr president , i should like to believe that compromises will be reached regarding the few points still to be clarified , enabling us to go ahead with the vote in strasbourg .
furthermore , it is regrettable that the commission has not acted upon the recommendations of parliament , the council of europe , the commissioner , and the osce for example , on the violation of the principle of confidentiality of journalistic sources , extremely disproportionate sanctions , and abolishing the political and financial independence of public service broadcast media .
it is a question of the future of our children , which means our future .
continuing with old programmes and designing new programmes has to be given in - depth scrutiny .
15 .
it must not slip to number two as a result of the current economic difficulties .
let me go straight to the point .
the rule is that , if the author is absent , the question lapses .
i should like to thank the rapporteur , mr guido sacconi , for the important contribution which he made in achieving the agreement and i trust that you will support the compromise agreement in the vote tomorrow .
these agreements should ensure that the determination to fight terrorism and criminality will not call into question the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights , not least the rights to privacy , informational self - determination and data protection .
on these points , in fact , by creating opportunities for one group of people , it restricts the opportunities of another group .
if there are difficulties in implementing the operational programmes of each member state , then these should be overcome ( including by increasing the community co - financing rates ) .
it is , however , the crisis that prompts this urgent intervention .
we need diverse impact assessment , drawing on a broad range of policy options and focusing on the practical issues that are important for the operation of an optional instrument .
the committee on budgets has created a special reserve to boost activity - based management .
it is the commission which has the right of initiative , and it is the commission who must now come forward with a real package .
greece 's situation is not unique ; the eu will have to face other similar shock effects .
they cover co 2 efficiency , biodiversity , but also social criteria .
hugo chávez got to where he is today partly because we have helped him through our foreign policy omissions and commissions .
finally , the stockholm programme will bring safety and security to europe 's citizens , and it is extremely important that we get this programme in place .
evgeni kirilov 's report on the cohesion policy and investments in the real economy underlines the importance of these features common to member states as a first requirement in the common strategy for pursuing social and economic policies .
' enter into constructive talks ' with ' continue the constructive talks ' .
all this would make strasbourg more attractive because it is a beautiful city .
when european citizens use twitter , they express their consent to twitter 's privacy policy .
i believe it is essential for public servants to be answerable to the public , which is why they must give objective and detailed accounts of how the public funds made available to them have been used .
improving and strengthening the european judicial area also means improving and modernising the way in which justice works , which in turn depends on our using new methods of communication ; this is the essence of the e-justice project .
instead of taking this into account , europe is making iran the solution to the problems of the middle east , when it is actually the main problem .
- ( lt ) i have a question , commissioner .
europe must learn from the nuclear incidents in japan and undertake to guarantee nuclear safety across the continent .
pesticides are essential for growing food , and they are already subject to a stringent safety regime .
in other words , the european union makes a decision and therefore proposes that the member states act in that way .
an example , of course , is the nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , who led the national league for democracy to victory in elections held 18 years ago and has spent 12 years in detention - and recently the junta decided to further extend the period of her house arrest .
it is important that we spend subsidies to facilitate mine closures properly : to ensure that the employees concerned are retrained and redeployed in other sectors of the labour market .
at the moment there are 27 different regimes and approaches to solving this problem and , of course , we have no illusions that such a complicated question can be resolved in such a short time .
ultimately , it is not abuses of flags of convenience that we need to combat , but the very existence of this practice .
( pt ) madam president , it is important for everyone to join in the fight against trafficking in human beings , with a view to eradicating it .
finally , european - level foundations like this can ensure an efficient financial framework for cooperation between national political foundations and teachers at european level , including other representatives of youth organisations and civil society .
it was not the first demonstration in which this social group had expressed its discontent .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i welcome the president of the council and thank the chairman of the committee , mr deprez , for his introduction .
such reforms are welcomed both by the eu and by the citizens of turkey .
i would like to highlight two specific issues : first , public funding .
the losers will be the workers , the artists and human evolution itself because , under coercion from the multinationals , the overwhelming majority of players and performers are obliged to assign all their rights to them in return for a pittance .
we can no longer prevent it , but we can hope and strive to control it .
a genuine integration of the roma into our society would be actual proof of the fact that the cornerstones of democracy , the rule of law and human rights still form the basis of the european community .
i support the implementation of the new european investment bank package which will provide eur 30 billion , earmarked for loans to smes .
( es ) mr president , the united nations regards trafficking in persons as incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human being ; nonetheless , every year over half a million people are victims of trafficking , of whom 80 % are women and girls , half are minors and the majority are prisoners of sexual exploitation .
that being the case , the commission 's role and also our role as parliament - and , incidentally , the role of the euro - mediterranean parliamentary assembly as well - is a special role .
the main priority is the buildings in eastern europe .
the objective of the commission proposal being debated today is to revise the basic legal framework governing the production of statistics at european level .
we want security to be in place ; however , we also want consumers to know how much they are paying for what .
in addition , the rights of underage players must be safeguarded effectively at all times .
in the past , enisa was harshly criticised .
however , if we impose disproportionate constraints - particularly in relation to traceability - on operators who place timber on the market , this will result in our businesses becoming less competitive without for all that reducing instances of illegal logging , which will be redirected to other markets .
data in the fisheries sector and scientific advice regarding the common fisheries policy ( vote )
every effort must be made to establish their fate and help bring them safely back to their loved ones .
china is still terrorised by the chinese communist party after 61 years of power .
that must change , as we lead the world on these issues .
there must be stronger political engagement by the host governments , and stronger coherence among donors , including internally among member states .
it beggars belief that today , we are discussing a topic that has been on the agenda since 1957 , no less , when the equal treatment of men and women , equal pay for men and women were anchored in the treaties .
in writing . - early learning in the eu follows a long and finely differentiated tradition in the different member states .
if the commission really meant that , it would not present us with a framework directive , which accords the member states the greatest possible self - determination in the definition of goals for soil protection .
these payments will be quicker and more flexible and there will only be a single payment , which will enable the required projects to be implemented in a short time in areas such as infrastructure , energy or the environment .
they see an eu - canada agreement as a vehicle to force extensive privatisation in areas like public transport , water provision and electricity .
georgia was brutally attacked in august 2008 by the armies of the russian federation and , besides suffering damage on a large scale and numerous fatalities , has also experienced a serious deterioration of its economic condition .
however , in our view car manufacturers should be given the opportunity to choose themselves how they wish to meet the environmental targets set by us politicians .
acts done at eu level should be ambitious and in keeping with the scientific reality of our times .
i therefore considered that this report , aimed at simplifying the way in which funds are granted for research , development and innovation via the seventh framework programme , deserves to be supported .
financial , energy and political security , as well as the consolidation of the european project 's basic values , can only be guaranteed through a close partnership with our neighbours .
unfortunately clouds are gathering over the eu 's future : the paradoxical irish vote ( ireland having become the ' celtic tiger ' that we know thanks to eu funds ) , the government crisis in austria , the statements of the polish president , are all worrying signs .
there are concerns that the financial services and insurance industries in the european union are less efficient than they should be , and consequently eu industry faces higher costs for financial services and insurance than its competitors in third countries .
i therefore call on the players in bosnia and herzegovina to adopt the anti - corruption act and lay down rules for the exchange of information between the different parts of the police service as quickly as possible .
as a result of the debates held over the last few months , we voted in favour of creating bert , which would simplify cooperation by the national regulatory authorities and would guarantee actual participation .
why should they have to examine their entire country and define risk areas , even though they already have exemplary legislation ?
i am very grateful to commissioner šemeta for the fact that the commission , under his leadership , has now , for the first time , carried out a consultation amongst subsidy recipients on the subject of ' obstacles and difficulties in the application procedure ' .
hopefully , this will bring pressure on the chinese government to rethink actions like the arrest of hu jia .
( hu ) ethnic discrimination is clearly prohibited by eu and international law .
in the light of the french presidency 's objective of establishing a governance process for the european research area ( era ) by the end of 2009 , could the commission specify what measures it plans undertaking , in cooperation with member states and parliament , to put in place science policy evaluation methodologies to ensure evidence - based policy options for science and research and development in the eu ?
i believe that you are laying yourself open to a real risk , and not just to public health .
the neverending story is now becoming reality .
thousands of survivors , if not more , are being put up in military camps for the time being .
the commitment of the business community is equally important , with self - regulation a key to success .
i support the commission proposal to phase out state aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date .
the stockholm programme has not been consigned to the museum .
and so the irish are forced to have yet another referendum so they can deliver the only answer that is acceptable to the european union - which is ' yes ' .
this , then , is another element to be taken into account .
we need an integrated european strategy for solidarity and sustainable development which is based on defending productive sectors and public investment , by effectively boosting community funds to support countries with weaker economies , which respects nature and creates jobs with rights , and which promotes public services , increases purchasing power and ensures a fair distribution of income to reduce poverty .
let us trust that people who can vote for us are also sufficiently capable of choosing the right foodstuff in the shops if provided with the appropriate information .
all the same we hope that at some point there will be some movement on the question of the negotiating mandate for the new partnership and cooperation agreement .
it is through respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms that a democratic regime can ultimately be recognised .
whether this package will be a good birthday present remains to be seen .
building new houses and renovating existing ones , improving access to utilities , as well as education , healthcare and jobs , are viable solutions for enabling us to achieve our objective .
mr president , i should like to draw your attention to the huge opportunity afforded by innovation partnerships for the sorely needed economic and social development of the european union , and to the serious risk which exists , in that incorrect use of this tool could increase the innovation and research divide between the member states of the european union still further .
nonetheless , the union 's role as a coordinator and promoter makes a significant contribution to presenting europe as a very attractive and diverse tourist destination .
therefore , the commission considers it crucial to examine how to deal with macro - financial assistance in the future , notably within the framework of the lisbon treaty .
the problem is nothing to do with stress testing one incident .
( hu ) mr president , i cannot emphasis enough that european engineers and developers have carried out outstanding work and , as the vice - president announced , we are awaiting the launch of giove - b.
i too am extremely satisfied with the outcome of this debate .
that is particularly true , as a number of honourable members have said , in kosovo , where i have met the government .
allow me to give you a few examples : first of all , the failure to spend the cohesion funds , the impossibility of executing the pilot projects we hold dear , such as the erasmus - style programme for apprentices , the lack of transparency in the choices of research firms , the poor implementation of selection competitions for new officials .
this is especially visible in third countries .
we are extremely concerned , first of all by the humanitarian situation in burma , and secondly about the responsibility of the burmese authorities for countering the effects of the disastrous cyclone , and in this context about their responsibility for securing access so that the humanitarian aid can reach those who need it .
the role of nato was mentioned in several speeches .
mr president , it is good that the eu is trying to preserve endangered fish stocks , but before there is too much self - congratulation on these proposals , we must remember that many past eu fishing rules have been appalling failures .
just as mr juncker stated to parliament in his speech , the euro is very definitely an ' anchor of stability ' .
the refurbishment of power stations currently in operation may also be of key significance .
those are the questions that we need to answer and i think that now more than ever it is at last time for europe to get back to politics .
at the same time , we also tried to promote the interests of consumers by reinforcing implementing measures on , for example , marketing and monitoring , supporting the exclusion of cloned animals from the food chain , and specific labelling provisions .
let me also voice our hope that it will continue to do so in future , enabling aid to be dispensed effectively at the point of need .
emotionally , this situation is extremely important to greeks .
the directive only extends the application of that which already exists , so it does not in any way involve more bureaucracy .
however , at the same time , better information must be provided to citizens through appropriate information campaigns and campaigns for promoting voluntary labels for other production methods which respect the environment and animals , such as ' integrated production ' , ' outdoor grazing ' and ' hill farming ' .
member of the commission . - ( de ) mr president , may i sum up once again : it was an extremely interesting debate and we all very clearly see the need to respond to this .
that is a political achievement on an issue that was not on the european agenda until two years ago and it is , therefore , also a response to those who were aware of the need for practical results .
according to the commission 's proposal , the conditions and procedure for granting status will become simpler and clearer in the european union .
we all know why : linguistic problems , justified apprehension about the risks , uncertainty about the tax arrangements , etc.
these accompanying measures are justified by the reduction in tariff preferences granted to the acp countries following the conclusion , in december 2009 , of the geneva agreement with the united states and the countries of latin america .
it is important to bear in mind , however , that its effectiveness depends solely on the exchange of data with the us being entirely reciprocal .
i think that would be a better approach to take .
in writing . - i voted for this report which states that one of the key challenges in relaunching the single market is ensuring political leadership , commitment and coordination .
in this case , we have chosen to support the original proposals as a counterbalance to the disagreeable tendencies in this parliament .
this is why it would have been wise to confine ourselves here to minimal harmonisation instead of trying to harmonise as much as possible .
i have received the following nomination : mr lászló tőkés .
i would also like to comment on the problem of the lowest price .
the view of the member states that not everything can be solved at european level is a blatant error .
it is wonderful that slovenia has the presidency .
i therefore believe that the ball is now in the court of the member states ' authorities .
although the progress towards a completed democratic transition varies from country to country - in belarus there have been only minor advances , while in ukraine and georgia , some significant steps have been taken - the european union should always sustain the possibility for the eastern neighbourhood countries to accede to the eu , since the efforts to establish functional democracy , rule of law and respect of human rights can sometimes be exhausting to the point of relapse .
what , then , was i trying to do ?
as the rapporteur mentions , the very purpose of advertising is to influence each and every one of us - women and men alike .
we need only look at the sums spent by the tobacco industry on advertising to understand the enormity of the challenge we face .
in fact , productivity in the manufacturing sector in europe is going through difficult times , while emerging countries are not only growing but also investing heavily in research and technology .
europe must not only drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions ; it must also adapt to global warming .
it is to be welcomed that the use of biometric data in passports and travel documents will become subject to stricter rules and harmonisation , especially since the abolition of europe 's internal borders has demonstrated the need for reinforced safety controls at the external borders .
the monitoring of this measure would require much more time , and potentially also more staff , unpacking of items and other procedures .
firstly , because of competition within the union in the internal market ; in other words , it must not be possible for one country to derive a competitive advantage as a result of the neglect of animals .
it highlights , in particular , how important it is for the european parliament and for the council to pay attention to compliance with the charter throughout the legislative process .
for others more prone to sermonising , this amounts to saying that ' we europeans must give lessons on how to protect these poor africans from the chinese ' .
however , we know from our experience of world bank and international monetary fund programmes - and what we are currently seeing in ireland is not so very different from this - that in the end , these countries have no choice .
fellow members , please understand once and for all that turkey is a country which , less than 100 years ago , committed genocide against the peoples within its borders and peoples which had recently liberated themselves from turkish rule .
not to do more on energy efficiency would , in any case , be crazy . energy efficiency means economic efficiency .
prevention and awareness - raising must be improved and social rights to support victims must be strengthened .
this will provide a higher rate of growth and increased employment .

let me repeat : i believe that the european union is uniquely placed to lead in building this future , precisely because we have proved over the last 60 years that we as europe can meet and master the challenges of cooperation across borders , of coordination between peoples , and of building unity out of diversity .
in other words , we reduce the habitats of birds and other animals . the future common agricultural policy must reconcile biodiversity with agricultural subsidies .
however , this is an interesting question .
i am more than willing , however , to discuss the matter with the competent commissioner and to ensure that you get an answer as quickly as possible to the question as to whether the commission has any plans in this respect .
the report welcomes the fact that parliament will have more influence on the eu 's legislative work .
the matter is urgent .
eurosceptics have always been represented in this parliament , well represented , have almost always had a political group and i am sure that will continue to be the case .
mr president , freedom of expression and an independent media are the cornerstone of democracy and they have to be valued highly and protected .
by any understanding of the financing of the development of rural areas , confidence is being destroyed here and structural interruptions provoked .
on top of that , there is strong competition for attracting and keeping the most talented researchers .
mr president , if the european union were a car , this treaty would be about tuning that vehicle .
while there may well be good points in it , it eventually went too far .
the situation has now changed dramatically .
on financial regulation , the european union wants to move the frontier further : no financial product , no institution , no market , no jurisdiction should be exempt from regulation .
madam president , whilst the term ' greening ' of pillar one may appeal to armchair farmers , it will pose major problems to heavy - land farmers who could well abandon land rather than attempt to plant it in the spring .
4. (
governments in the poorest developing countries are being swindled out of eur 92 billion a year in tax revenues , while the world bank estimates that just a third of that - eur 30 billion to eur 34 billion - would pay for the un 's millennium development goals .
( nl ) madam president , the debate further to mr böge 's question has not actually borne a great deal of fruit .
this challenge requires practical responses from the eu that are designed to tackle not only cooperation for development but also foreign policy , implementing preventive measures at both regional and global level , measures which make use of all the foreign policy instruments available , and are focused on security , regional cooperation , bilateral agreements with countries of origin and transit , and protection of human rights and democratisation .
indeed , the union has become a preferred target of international crime .
however , around 25 million europeans suffer from rare diseases and they should therefore be given the opportunity to receive healthcare in other member states .
you probably know that the council is preparing for the next round of talks on human rights between the european union and china . these talks will take place in ljubljana on 15 may .
we are talking about a country that has 165 million inhabitants , is in possession of nuclear weapons and is engaged in a fight against terrorist organisations such as al qaeda and the taliban .
the european convention for the protection of human rights , which is the text that the court applies , is quite old - it dates back to 1950 - and , like the treaty of rome , it was also signed in rome .
we have been working with your great support over the last months on this challenge .
it took a long time to choose a line that would be balanced enough for both consumers and businesses .
this should be interesting when you consider that hungary is currently subject to a barrage of international criticism because of its new media law and this law is clearly in conflict with article 11 of the european charter of fundamental rights .
the main objective is to ensure fast and easy movement of people and goods among member states .
we should like to hear your opinion on this , commissioner kuneva .
we are able to say today that it was the right decision .
the number of new infections continues to outstrip the expansion of treatment , and two thirds of the people in need of treatment in 2009 were still not receiving it , which means that 10 million people in need did not have access to the necessary effective treatment .
companies which do not manage to adapt in time risk facing fines , which it will not be possible to pass on to consumers .
meps need to inform themselves of the consequences of this proposal .
however , it is not enough to give a hungry person a fish : they must be taught to fish .
above all , i would like to emphasise his initiative in refining the definition of airport charges , and secondly the airports we are covering , and the service levels of airports and their correlation with the obligations of airport operators .
european satellite navigation programmes ( egnos and galileo ) ( signature )
( ro ) madam president , romania has a law stipulating that teachers ' salaries should be increased , because they are very low .
this underlines how important we believe this agenda is .
the blame game will not do anyone any good .
i am confident that this house will have a future opportunity to have all its provisions successfully adopted in a less compromised piece of legislation that will truly and comprehensively protect citizens from major respiratory damage .
firstly , there should be a target from 2010 onwards and then a limit from 2015 onwards of 25 micrograms per cubic meter .
without common rules , those border crossing points where the vis is not systematically used could be exploited by illegal immigrants and criminals .
the amsterdam treaty further enhanced these codecision rights , while the lisbon treaty will establish codecision as the rule in the crafting of european legislation , and therefore refers , appropriately , to the ' ordinary legislative procedure ' .
i want to thank all fellow members for the professional job they have done .
since then , not only has the number of members of the european union increased , but also its ambition and responsibilities .
i believe that we need to be cautious , we need to give time for the clarifications to be given on the issues of concern to the irish voters and we need time for those issues to be debated in full and in public - and in due time allow the electorate to give their view .
this is all very well .
i should like to ask the commissioner once more whether he , too , can envisage any possibilities for exchanging dutch practice with other member states who are facing the same problems , particularly in large towns and cities .
22 .
so what are we really doing ?
it is important that our policy of engagement has been openly supported by representatives of civil society in belarus , who took part recently in a very helpful discussion with members of this parliament .
not as far as i am concerned .
in connection with this week 's visit to strasbourg by the european network for independent living , and welcoming the commission 's commitment to ' ring fence ' a fixed percentage of its overseas development assistance to health , education and social services , which steps is the commission making to make sure community development projects for disabled people benefit from these funds ?
mr ford raised some of the issues about bilateral relations .
if we advise young people to express their views violently , then we must fear for the european union .
just one year after the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon , we are holding a discussion on the forthcoming adoption of the regulation on the citizens ' initiative .
the impact differs from one geographical area to another , but it is a cross - border impact and needs to be addressed with europe 's assistance .
we also like to talk about european integration .
the new member states are obviously focusing mainly on catching up with the more developed countries of the european union in terms of development .
we want to understand trends , to try to make policies more relevant ; we do not want to pry into people 's personal lives .
granting more visas is one policy that italy can pursue to try to help those countries .
- mr president , i just wish to agree very much with my colleague , dr charles tannock .
these changes have been felt most painfully by nations in the most difficult economic situation and countries at war .
on the other hand , the programmes will be of benefit mainly to large agricultural enterprises with competitive production costs .
more specifically , the 2007 bilateral aid programme with armenia is targeting financial support in the field of judicial reform , to the tune of eur 18 million .
such programmes must also be developed without additional financial expenditure and bureaucracy .
it is important that the second instrument allows for this assistance to be given irrespective of the consent of the governments of third countries and other public authorities .
i think that one such opportunity is encouraging the participation not only of the elderly , but also of young people , families living in difficult circumstances and people with reduced mobility in the social tourism programmes developed by the union .
the first concerns cooperation among the authorities in europe .
at present , 63 % of the programmes under the regional development fund and the cohesion fund remain unapproved , as do 83 % of european social fund programmes and 75 % of rural development programmes , even though the first programme year is already coming to an end .
indeed , why allow korea to have duty drawback , which is a benefit that has never been granted before , not even to developing countries such as the countries of the mediterranean ?
in addition , stricter rules will be introduced for unavoidable traces of heavy metals .
i welcome the commission 's intention to launch a green paper on revising the vat system with the goal of creating an environment that is more favourable to business , and a system that is simpler and more robust for the member states .
however , i fear that , overall , the report seems overly inclined towards increased taxes , when in several countries ( such as portugal ) , we are already experiencing an overdose of fiscal burdens .
each of us , because of our culture , our character and our political position is liable to see it from a particular point of view .
many have urged for the regulation of the lists of unfair contract terms .
i support the fava report , which we will use to impose harsher punishments on employers using illegal labour .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
( ga ) madam president , as a member for ireland , i cannot say that i am too proud of what is currently happening in my own country .
i urge you to write to the member states i have just mentioned , to speed up implementation of this important directive .
so , after years of the eu isolating belarus , i now agree that a pragmatic stick and carrot approach is the correct one .
( the president cut off the speaker )
it is essential to promote the strengthening of parliamentary scrutiny , to support free and pluralist media , the independence of the judiciary and the empowerment of civil society , giving priority to women , vulnerable groups and minorities .
we can do so straight away by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and drawing up a suitable forestry policy that recognises the multiple environmental services performed by forests , particularly as carbon sinks .
( pl ) mr president , commissioner , mr jouyet , i am a member of the acp - eu joint parliamentary assembly and during the last session held in kigali , rwanda , i listened to president paul kagame , who spoke of the need to stabilise the situation in central africa .
firstly , the nation state is a form of political organisation which , in historical terms , seeks to unify territories , rationalise public action and subsequently pave the way to democratic systems .
private equity companies will have to give notification of their presence in the companies acquired and provide information to employees , in particular , concerning their future strategy for the business and the potential repercussions for jobs .
it continually refers to the right of the internal market to govern what happens .
president of the commission . - we are not forcing anyone to take any measures .
it is true that the reasons for the deficits we see in europe are different .
its aim is to take dialogue and cooperation ' beyond development ' , ' beyond africa ' and ' beyond institutions ' by means of greater eu - africa cooperation within international bodies and in multilateral negotiations , on issues such as human rights and climate change .
it is a matter of principle .
this kind of monitoring system would not be feasible and would subsequently be considered unacceptable .
indeed , the eu and imf must allocate considerable macroeconomic aid to cover the budget deficit and social costs for the subsequent period .
i should like to register my strong protest against this state of affairs , and also mention a situation that is gaining notoriety in the united states .
the report by linda mcavan , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and food safety , on the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council on the voluntary participation by organisations in a community eco - management and audit scheme - c 6-0278/2008 - .
the eu should concentrate on strengthening internal security and increasing the defensive capabilities of its members , especially member states which share a border with countries where extreme nationalist ideologies are popular , and also member states which have attracted the interest of terrorist groups .
it is essential to create a common eu database of organs available for donation and transplantation , and a database of all living and deceased donors .
the money should be given , or given back , to where it comes from , namely the taxpayers .
- before the vote
there was no serious debate in committee .
instead of seriously analysing the part that the eu itself played in this failure , the majority of this house persists in picking scapegoats such as china ( whose per capita atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide are less than half those of the eu ) , and now the countries of the bolivarian alliance for the peoples of our america .
there is a bilateral agreement between italy and belarus , which means that italy is not affected by the ban .
situations in which key provisions of the directive are interpreted differently in the different member states are also inadmissible .
this would mean an end to broadcasting in hungarian , ruthenian and ukrainian .
in my opinion , it is important to implement these measures at source .
it is very important that the application of this regulation is not exclusively limited to large , socially isolated communities , but that its provisions can also be applied to the most socially vulnerable groups , like the disabled , the poor , needy young families , immigrants and others , who also suffer from social isolation and do not have opportunities to renovate their homes .
rapporteur . - mr president , we now have a text which says : ' instructs its president to forward this resolution to the council and the commission ' , and i would like to add the words ' and the governments and parliaments of the member states ' .
the current compromise takes these considerations into account and not only ensures that potentially dangerous chemicals are traded in a responsible way but also provides the room for manoeuvre that is needed so that the international exchange of goods can continue to run smoothly .
we are very proud and glad that we joined the euro , and we will be staying .
we are completely dependent on one another in the matter of energy , but that dependence needs to work both ways .
i remember president reagan 's speech here in 1985 , and to quote an irish poet - william butler yeats - speaking of his ireland , in a poem called easter sunday 1916 he said : ' all 's changed , changed utterly ; a terrible beauty has been born ' .
however , you are asking a lot of parliament .
it not only has a father , mr bowis , but also a mother , mrs grossetête .
the german company e. on has been granted access to siberian reserves and the energy market , and both countries will jointly build a gas pipeline , an umbilical cord , under the baltic sea .
to underscore this need , the commission published recommendation no 207/425 / ec of 13 july 2007 , identifying a set of actions for the enforcement of council regulation ( ec ) no 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein .
in writing . - ( nl ) i have voted against this report , because directives of this kind undermine the member states ' capacity to be in control of their own territories and to take the appropriate measures to maintain law and order .
as for the importance of introducing courses in european law and european history into the school curriculum , the commission shares the opinion that young people should be taught the essential facts about the european union at school .
this year , after intensive consultations with all interested groups , the commission will also publish a white paper on adaptation , which will represent a basis for further discussions concerning the european union 's policy in this area .
during the drafting of my report , i had the marvellous experience of working with fantastic colleagues from the secretariat of our committee on the internal market and consumer protection .
moreover , in addition to the significant increase in the efficiency of border controls , a systematic consultation of the visa information system would also constitute a preliminary condition for greater flexibility when submitting the visa application .
i even wonder at times where the glass is , when it comes to bosnia .
we should look at how we might increase the higher - education qualifications of a number of people who never had that opportunity in their youth .
i congratulate turkey on the symbolic steps it has taken and on the dialogue which the government has explicitly sought .
this refers to the amount of risk that banks must retain in their own balance sheets when they place ' structured ' products with savers .
i also believe in this sense that the charter of fundamental rights , which is a beautiful text which should be read by every child in the european schools and which should be worked on by every student in our universities , really makes the right point : there is no difference between men and women .
but on a note of caution : the european parliament 's control over this will be particularly unbending .
it has adopted many reports and opinions which deserve more attention from the other committees in parliament .
on behalf of the ind / dem group . - mr president , what worries me most is the suggestion that the european investment bank ( eib ) has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis - that it can somehow act as the europe - wide body to provide stimulus where member states have singularly failed to coordinate their own stimuli .
i support the rapporteur 's opinion that the european union should take the lead in making the notion of this duty a reality .
current knowledge and technical solutions enable us , and will long continue to permit us , to use renewable sources only as a supplement .
all the speakers who are now bemoaning the fact that prices are rising - finally heading upwards for once - and are calling for measures to hold back the price rises .
oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see minutes
closure of the sitting
i believe , as you do , that this crisis is also , and above all , a crisis of our values , of the basic values of our society .
member of the commission . - mr president , i am honoured to conclude this very constructive debate .
however , on this last point , i have to say that the democratic movement 's delegation was disappointed .
- ( fr ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , minister of justice , it is precisely in this capacity that i should like to address you at the end of this debate .
finally , i would like to welcome mrs mcguinness on her initiative to put this issue to scrutiny before the commission .
in the short term , implementation of a mechanism to compensate the european farmers most affected must be guaranteed , while in the medium term , it will be necessary to reform the early warning system for unsafe food to prevent any more unfounded alarms in the future .
( pl ) mr president , the debate triggered by mr sacconi 's question is of great relevance to the citizens of europe .
they are neither a nation without a state nor a national minority .
the existing limit on housing expenditure of 3 % of the european regional development fund allocation is decidedly too low .
all of this has led to an erosion of trust in russia as a european partner .
( lv ) firstly , i would like to thank the commissioner and the majority of my fellow members for truly liberal access to the electricity market , which together with energy efficiency measures will really allow us to reduce prices in the future .
in this case you are underestimating the power of your own resolutions , although we seek to monitor and guarantee compliance with such decisions .
( nl ) mr president , i see that , fortunately , i am not the only one who very much questions this rather absurd initiative , the apparent purpose of which is to brand italy a country where freedom of information is fundamentally under threat .
( applause and heckling )
for example , more work will be needed on the capital calibration of complex products and of banks ' ability to identify potential problems in crisis situations , including potential concentration of risks in certain areas .
madam president , it is an oral amendment on compensation for farmers , with thanks to mrs rivasi for the initiative .
of course some countries are further ahead in this struggle than others .
indeed , i believe it is vital to stress the importance of social protection for the assisting spouses or recognised life partners of self - employed workers .
i think that this is a very one - sided approach .
i remember when the iranian people rose up to get rid of the shah , and we know how that ended , with a regime that still hangs dozens of people even now .
it did this despite difficult conditions - the political situation at home is not exactly easy , of course , the treaty of lisbon is new and even the relationship with the european council is not all that easy .
so we are having a debate , but i can assure you that there will be a clear next step in this screening exercise .
the important points here are that we must defend and improve the european social model and that it is high time we introduced a social progress clause as a binding protocol to the existing eu treaties .
at the same time , the amount of payment appropriations is decreasing by 3.3 % , and the amount of payment appropriations for eu cohesion policy is decreasing most rapidly - by 14 % .
altogether , several hundred more workers have been made redundant .
you already confirmed , i think , what many of us feel - that with all the work that is currently going on to implement the services directive , the green paper on the consumer acquis , which we have just considered and which will result in a horizontal instrument in that area plus the other work that is going on - which my colleague from the committee on legal affairs , ms kauppi , and i know ms wallis will cover later - i think it is much too early to contemplate any further detailed provisions at this stage .
this is a very important issue .
the forthcoming summit in stockholm will discuss a range of issues important to the eu , russia and , indeed , the wider global community , and parliament has today sent a united message highlighting the areas of key interest and concern .
i would , however , like to draw attention to three important elements in this report .
in spite of what i have said , there is no room for complacency .
they should not give the impression today that they are leading the others .
the introduction of a public register to which lobbies must sign up if they are to have access to these two institutions constitutes genuine democratic progress to the benefit of citizens .
( pl ) mr president , the european commission 's initiative to impose on member states the duty to publish information on the beneficiaries of eu funds obtained under the umbrella of the common agricultural policy is worthy of support in every respect .
today we not only have to improve safety conditions , we also have to strengthen the european atomic energy community and move towards a european energy community .
a few months ago the hungarian prime minister refused to meet his slovak counterpart and there is renewed talk about the revision of the outcome of world war ii .
with them was a leading sikh i have come to know .
in writing . - i voted to support sweden 's nomination of h.g. wessberg to join the european court .
firstly , last january we introduced more frequent decision - making in infringement proceedings with the aim of speeding up cases ; secondly , we launched the ' eu pilot ' project in 15 member states last april to test a new method aimed at improving problem solving and the availability of information ; thirdly , the main purpose of this initiative , which is close to parliament 's interests , is to better serve the interests of citizens and businesses with regard to questions and problems identified in the application of community law , including infringements of this law ; fourthly , the commission will nonetheless continue to decide to prosecute infringements in the event of non - conformance within the framework of the ' eu pilot ' project , particularly through infringement proceedings ; and fifthly , president barroso has written to the chairman of parliament 's committee on legal affairs , mr gargani , with details of the pilot project 's performance in december 2008 .
this amounts to an unprecedented disparity between citizens of the european union .
the debate is closed .
having a lisbon strategy that is purely the sum of national initiatives and having a stability and growth pact that puts different amounts of pressure on the various countries using it and subject to it are limitations , to which we can add the limited budget available .
4 .
madam president , i wonder if mr vajgl has considered the cost to the eu taxpayer of these extra - territorial initiatives proposed in the report and which he is also endorsing ?
last but not least , madam president , commissioner , along with our friends from the us and other countries we should draught a comprehensive un convention against terrorism .
i will try again .
it will not apply to butter or cheese or apple juice , or even alcohol .
in this context , i would like to take up your proposal and confirm that i will soon , in the autumn , propose a new evaluation mechanism following the entry into force of the lisbon treaty for the reasons that you stated , mr coelho .
thank you all the same for the gesture .
to conclude : last week parliament also held a meeting hosted by dagmar roth - behrendt at which the european patient forum outlined its manifesto .
all this is having a negative effect on the people , leading to despair and inciting revolt .
in my opinion , the current mandate is not ambitious enough to achieve this .
the european parliament adopted a clear and meaningful position by rejecting the possibility of a 65 - hour working week .
if we do not make fresh efforts to combat the crisis in europe , unemployment will rise to 25 million at the beginning of 2010 , and the condition of public finance will worsen considerably .
the next item is the report by mrs merkies , on behalf of the committee on industry , research and energy , on innovation union : transforming europe for a post - crisis world .
whilst it is difficult to set a firm date for this , it is clear that it needs to get under way as soon as possible .
the most important amendment is to change the reference years from 2005-2007 to 2004-2006 , as the data for 2007 are so new that we cannot be certain of them , and it is therefore better to use the data that we are sure of .
the developments in america have demonstrated that the market itself is not capable of dealing with these and similar crises .
the overall approach proposed by the commission is a continuation of the report by mario monti to the president of the european commission , ' a new strategy for the single market ' .
since the latest enlargement , the black sea is also an eu sea .
i would particularly like to talk about the krehl report .
first of all i want to raise the issue of flexibility of financing instruments in the external area .
you could have made the same mistakes as the previous belgian presidency in 2001 .
on few matters can we be so unanimous .
i have read mr brok 's report , which was adopted in the committee on constitutional affairs on monday .
now i use the word ' ask ' with some care .
in writing . - ( it ) i voted for the mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egf ) in favour of the czech republic , because i consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers experiencing difficulty on account of the economic crisis .
as the honourable member knows , the primary objective of ec competition policy is to make markets work better for the benefit of consumers in the eu .
statement by the president of the european parliament 's delegation to the conciliation committee - novel foods ( continuation of debate )
our businesses , researchers , scientists and universities all find themselves having to compete on a global level with markets that have enormous amounts of resources available to them , often with very much lower costs than our own .
well , the irish people decided that they much preferred to be on the eu train than the ukip bulldozer .
in writing . - ( sv ) the employment policies of the member states should be determined nationally by way of a broad and democratically anchored debate based on research and national experience .
finally , we are counting , commissioner , on your resolve - which we know is considerable - to put a swift end to illegal fishing , which affects bluefin tuna and cod most of all , highly prized species which are heavily overfished at present .
we believe that , if you intend to make such a proposal for the winter flight plan , parliament will have to examine it carefully , because we would have to consider the interests of the many different types of airlines as well as the interests of airports and passengers more carefully .
you have displayed great diplomatic skills so far working with russia and ukraine , but it is vital that the russian government understands that holding nations to ransom is no way to conduct business in the modern world .
therefore , common freedoms and a common market , and not extending union competences , should be the central principle of the union 's economic policy .
there is a real danger that brochures and books will remain in offices unread .
as many as nine of the 80 paragraphs in the report are devoted to this matter .
i am cautiously optimistic that the dialogue on this question will continue .
the belgian presidency rightly points out that electricity in particular may also cause a division in society as a result of the fact that energy is becoming more expensive and therefore no longer accessible to everyone .
however , i think this will be difficult to achieve .
i must also mention here the important contribution made by russia in agreeing to our troops and equipment crossing its territory in transit .
mr heaton - harris , regarding the meaning of ' gnss ' , we now have two options : one is ' galileo navigation satellite system ' and the other is ' global navigation satellite system ' .
secondly , they do not aim to delete or replace the entire text .
in writing . - ukip supports the repeal of all eu legislation .
mr president , i welcome this debate .
nobody has been able to give an example .
if we are to deliver to consumers , we need to be more responsive to their expectations and better understand the problems they are facing in their day - to - day lives .
the two texts proposed by the commission , and i take this opportunity to applaud their common sense , correspond to our idea of immigration policy : a reasonably firm and humane policy .
the report focuses on transitional procedural guidelines on budgetary matters in view of the entry into force of the lisbon treaty .
this person 's freedom of movement is being restricted .
we need a campaign to make people aware that the way we live , and the way we work , has an economic and an ecological price attached .
madam president , we should continue to support the eu membership perspective for the countries of the western balkans .
that is the ultimate deadline .
that is , we need to do this without losing sight of the central values and the inviolability of the person springing from the european values created in the melting pot of jewish , christian and hellenistic culture in the centuries before and after the birth of christ .
the universality of these values must take precedence over geopolitics , once again cynically revealed on 10 december 2010 when 15 countries made a cowardly response to china 's express request that they boycott the awarding of the nobel peace prize to the chinese citizen , lu xiaobo .
the mandate also takes on board many suggestions offered by us meps , and this speaks volumes for the importance of the european parliament and for the new role granted to it by the treaty .
now it must designate an eu representative who will make both sides listen .
it is beyond dispute that our efforts must include confidence building and support for financial stability , as the european council has also said .
there remain elements of the proposal that could give rise to different interpretations .
( pl ) mr president , a few months ago the european parliament adopted a resolution condemning xenophobia and burgeoning nationalism in europe .
i assume that , in a few weeks , we will know whether we in europe have any legal or technical need to act , and we will then be happy to report back to parliament again .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( nl ) cross - border goods trains trundle through the european union at an average speed of 18 kilometres per hour .
i think it is paragraph 48 that refers to the death penalty .
as always , irrelevant amendments were tabled by different groups on various important matters of principle , such as whether the mrta should be included in the eu 's list of terrorist organisations , and on attempts to implement a peace process in colombia .
the result was the eu action plan for strengthening the eu 's involvement in afghanistan and pakistan .
that is the point of this debate and also of the resolution , and i therefore support it wholeheartedly .
the proposed measures place at the forefront the consumer , who in a well functioning internal energy market will be able to choose from among suppliers and opt for the best one based on his own judgement .
the instruments associated with the green paper present a series of measures without offering systemic solutions .
since 1 may 2009 , it has also been possible to use this fund to support workers made redundant as a result of the effects of the economic crisis and of the financial markets , which makes it even more relevant and necessary .
( de ) madam president , to keep everything up to date , i would ask that the following text be incorporated , which you will find on your voting list :
welcome once again after 18 years .
he has made that promise , regardless of the fact that both houses of the uk parliament ratified the treaty of lisbon in mid - 2008 .
as we have seen with the recent nobel prize and sakharov prize winners , protection of these human rights defenders is of the utmost importance and these measures are a step toward that end .
in conclusion i can therefore say that i welcome the present agreement , and shall be voting in favour of it .
the treaties provide us with a basis for this cooperation .
the report from mrs estrela deals with the issue of reducing health inequalities in the eu .
on behalf of the ind / dem group . - mr president , recently , in the rüffert case , a polish company paid 53 workers only 46 % of the agreed wage for the trade in germany .
we must reduce the considerable gap between the standards and policies adopted at european level and their application at national level .
with particular reference to economic and trade agreements with third countries or wto negotiations , the eu sometimes pays insufficient attention to the rights of workers , minorities , women and children outside the eu , becoming a tacit accomplice in criminal atrocities and intolerable practices .
this involves us similarly seeking and finding worldwide cooperation , such as in the approach we have created at the international criminal court .
in view of this , the council unanimously agreed a well - balanced budget that invested resources in education , research , infrastructure , cohesion , responsible public finances and margins for unforeseen events ; in other words , all the factors that we know to be important for growth and prosperity .
i absolutely reject this report , albeit that unfortunately , no final vote is possible in the second reading .
i rushed down to support mrs gräßle in her efforts and i think we all are doing that here today .
the mediterranean is the hope of three monotheistic religions and the civilisation of wheat and wine , not of sauerkraut and beer or mussels in chez léon .
in writing . - ( sk ) on 8 march 2007 on the occasion of international woman 's day , the committee on women 's rights and gender equality in the european parliament began its campaign for the eradication of violence against women .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on women 's rights and gender equality . - ( es ) mr president , commissioner , we in the committee on women 's rights and gender equality believe that the success of the first phase of the programme was less encouraging in terms of the participation of women : female students did account for 44 % , but participation differed greatly depending on the country , and female academics only accounted for 22 % , which , in our view , is unacceptable .
the eu must also do better with regard to the protection of biodiversity .
let us work for the security of our citizens and let us take the steps necessary in this regard .
that move may be based on grounds of swiftness and unity in decision making .
first of all , we seem to have concentrated on new proposals when we all know that there is existing legislation which member states are struggling to implement - and this has created an ill - at - ease feeling amongst member states , because they are clearly not prepared to move on to new laws when they have difficulties with existing ones .
this new crisis has once again highlighted the inability of the haitian authorities and of the health system to cope with this crisis .
we welcome eu initiatives to combat tuberculosis through this resolution , but we call for more scientific research to be undertaken to develop new forms of vaccine against this disease .
the oral question on the council 's strategy for the bali conference on climate change ( cop 13 and cop / mop 3 ) , by guido sacconi , on behalf of the temporary committee on climate change to the council - b 6-0379/2007 ) , and
the purpose of this initiative is to facilitate the position of consumers within the european union .
i ask myself : how is that ?
however , i would like to draw attention to one particular paragraph in mrs hedh 's report - namely paragraph 40 , in which we propose the establishment of a european consumer agency .
i am sure we will return to this matter again .
more importantly , what can be changed in future ?
finally , i welcome the assessment made by mr ehler , stressing the absence of an appropriate legislative framework that has financial resources available to it .
moreover , they also showed the route taken by central and eastern europe to freedom and democracy , and to the end of the division , not only of germany , but of the whole of europe .
however , this aspiration and potential are restricted by financial , bureaucratic and other kinds of obstacles .
these are funds with different and complementary objectives , beyond which one cannot replace the other .
we hope that the french presidency includes in its objectives the european charter of duties .
seven days before your question was tabled , on 30 september , the irish finance minister , mr lenihan , discussed the total cost of the restructuring of the anglo irish bank , giving two possible figures : a mid - range estimate of eur 29 billion and a higher estimate of eur 34 billion .
the aim of the egf is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies , and it is fundamental in facilitating their future access to new employment .
in general , four issues emerged from the discussions that were of particular concern to the commission .
the zone system is artificial and contrary to the european union 's principle of subsidiarity , and , as the remarks of my fellow member from the netherlands have just demonstrated , it makes flexible response impossible .
i am convinced that , in this spirit , you can pave the way for the emergence of a balanced solution , soon .
for the moment , there are no meat surpluses in the internal market , and that is why private storage measures cannot be justified at present .
even the few contacts between the child and the father are full of obstacles .
trade relations with these countries are just as important for the union .
it is , therefore , essential for this knowledge to be as rigorous and up - to - date as possible , meaning that there must be sufficient financing for this purpose , specifically through the financial instruments of the common fisheries policy .
i wish the spanish presidency every success in achieving its priorities and in finding solutions to the challenges which the european union is currently facing .
it is a milestone in terms of the environmental compatibility of european vehicles , as environmental compatibility , of course , is something that will not only be achieved through producing more fuel - efficient engines - cars also offer other entirely different options for saving fuel and reducing pollution .
working with you has also been a lot of fun .
of course we want effectiveness .
we therefore ask for the debate , the draft resolution , and then the vote at the next sitting .
this debate is therefore not yet over .
if we really want to strengthen the global competitive position of the eu , we cannot allow certain regions to be left behind because of obsolete infrastructure and poor educational , social and health services .
the vote on this report coincides with the publication , last week , of a unhcr study on the 44 industrialised nations .
the one - china policy is outdated and morally undermining to the image of the european union .
what we need is a pure and simple ban on all blending and mixing in europe , and in france in particular .
we know also that a worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to our economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries .
( ro ) i would like to congratulate mr stolojan for all his efforts in drafting the report on the recovery of claims .
it is true that we are in the middle of a crisis , and the court , which is maintained from voluntary contributions made by various countries , absorbs large sums of money .
another issue has arisen with regard to the future of this sector , which i personally - but the other commissioners , too - consider absolutely vital for the economy of the european union , but above all that of certain mountainous regions and regions with a particularly difficult hydrogeological system .
as mrs bauer has said , the topic we are debating is as old as the treaty of rome .
naturally , we have been very cautious on that point .
as a result of this , many jobs are both lost and created every day in europe .
the european parliament must strive to strengthen parliamentary scrutiny , by implementing a common foreign and security policy and actively exercising legislative , budget formation and discharge functions .
that is why it is very important to set up as quickly as possible the economic governance that was decided in the task force , which was debated on the basis of six proposals from the commission to parliament , and for all those involved in codecision to reach agreement .
however , when drawing up the regulation , we also took into account the fact that some of the mines are not competitive and have only survived so far thanks to constant injections of public money and public subsidies .
if you will allow me to make a further comment , in this instance on matters relating to financial markets , it must of course be said that while legislation has been passed to ensure that the events of two years ago cannot be repeated , the fed has now , for example , decided to place usd 600 million on the market without consultation , with the result that naturally , there are fears concerning inflation and other things and some turbulence in the global economy .
it is good that the report adopts a broader approach and addresses the factors which contribute to increased support for and renewed recruitment to groups which reject our models of society in favour of violence and sectarianism .
our responsibility is shared , first of all because the situation of the roma has not changed fundamentally in the new member states after enlargement or in the candidate countries while awaiting enlargement .
there is a worrying cloak of secrecy over certain still unknown details of the agreement .

the motion for a resolution - and i pay tribute for this to our rapporteur - is a well - balanced one , especially since we have taken into account the interests of our partners from the acp countries , as well as local european banana producers .
finally , territorial cooperation deserves particular attention in the next cohesion policy .
time is of the essence .
in writing . - ( ro ) i abstained from the vote on this motion for a resolution because the european union needs to have a much more mature reflection on the balance between security and freedom .
the unquestionable benefit of the approved legislation comes from improving the quality and therefore the safety of tyres .
after an extremely long period of waiting we are finally in a position to make europol into a concrete and effective tool in combating organised crime , as well as many other dangerous types of crime which are now manifesting themselves at european level - i am thinking , for instance , of the action that europol will be able to take on money - laundering .
we do not believe that the question of financing a universal service in small member states and in remote areas has been properly tackled .
our initial exchange of views on this involved looking at how we set targets , how we follow them up , how we evaluate results .
8 .
the strategy envisages a new legislative framework in the form of a general animal health law to be supplemented by implementing acts of a primarily technical nature .
approval of motor vehicles and their trailers ( vote )
since i am a member from a country which has not yet ratified the lisbon treaty , i should like to invite the governments of the czech republic , sweden and , of course , ireland too to work hard on the ratification of this document , because it is the prerequisite for more unified and more effective common foreign and security policies enabling us to deal with the challenges , including the challenges coming from the east and from russia , and to solve these problems .
there was a major debate in committee and we reached a very intelligent , high - quality compromise through the intervention of monica frassoni .
( ro ) mr. president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to join my colleagues who welcomed the drawing up of this report and to emphasize its fundamental value for the future of europe .
therefore , i believe that we should aim for a postponement and then ultimately ....
work placements are a good example of how university students can gain practical experience and then subsequently bring that experience into their studies .
this strategy must recognise the value of prevention , including the fight against the recruitment of terrorists and all factors favouring violent radicalisation .
in some countries instances of criminal treatment of polish workers have come to light , forcing them into slave labour .
mr president , europe cannot upgrade its relations with israel until its government convincingly demonstrates a change of course .
furthermore , the slovenian presidency has asked , for procedural and official reasons , for the meeting to be postponed until the next plenary part - session in belgium .
if the europeans now start to question whether we really want a legally binding agreement , it will call into question a process that , under the aegis of the united nations , has been supported by many europeans for many years .
it is actually not an argument at all ; it is a knock - out argument .
a transport system which works well on the local level is better than a service which is terminated due to excessive regulation .
i am in agreement with this .
we can be partners in this field only if the european union could incorporate nuclear energy issues more openly in its policies .
firstly , as regards croatia : the accession negotiations with croatia are proceeding according to plan and at this point i would like to express my agreement with mr swoboda 's view that , over the last two years , croatia has made substantial progress in meeting the accession benchmarks .
there is no free press .
i must say that , in my opinion , anything which reduces unnecessary conflict not only ensures more justice for the people , but also , in particular , creates more confidence between those involved in the legal process .
the ultimate aim is a better enforcement of eu laws and thus , healthier animals and decent living conditions for the relevant animals .
for this reason , we very much welcome the fact that the lead committee has taken our amendments on board in its report and is proposing a structure that puts less strain on our budget .
in doing this we were able to count on the excellent cooperation we have had with member states and with the ecb .
the cosmetics market is full of fanciful promises and quasi - scientific mumbo - jumbo , where the copywriter 's verbal flamboyance is the only yardstick in testing the product 's efficacy .
today 's adoption of the le foll report on adapting european agriculture to climate change goes along with this approach .
the cost of protecting the euro must be reduced in such a way that we force the commercial banks to acknowledge their losses .
the debate is closed .
however , with economic and monetary union , we at least have the instruments to tackle the problems more effectively .
why on earth have discussions never been held over the adoption of measures to impose a genuine and effective separation between commercial banks and speculative banks , as in the glass - steagall act ?
well aware that the work carried out by enisa has significant community interest , i hope it will receive increased resources .
written statements ( rule 149 )
given the existing trends and potential increase in dependence , the current reform of the common fisheries policy is a good opportunity for the eu to reinforce the economic performance of the sector and its ability to compete globally .
another astounding thing is the times at which these agencies become active .
let this be a lesson to us .
given the latest enlargement of the eu to 27 member states and with the increase in eu staff that implies , the significance of a well - reformed european school has become an issue of high priority .
may this publicising of their plight in europe afford them protection !
this is something which is not in the interests of the matter as a whole and which absolutely must not happen .
thanks to the excellent cooperation between commission , council and member states in handling national reform programmes and recommendations , the first european semester has lasted a semester , and not a day longer .
you have both done an excellent job .
please understand my response , mr leichtfried , as a gesture , a desire to offer you a clarification .
( hu ) mr boştinaru , i have two questions that i would like to ask : do romanian laws allow the granting of citizenship to individuals of romanian nationality even if they do not live in the territory of romania ?
what i can confirm is that the commission will soon be proposing an amendment to the regulation on credit rating agencies in order to entrust the new european securities and markets authority ( esma ) with overall responsibility for supervising these agencies .
by way of example , we are seeing a general slump in livestock farming in favour of imports of sheep from third countries .
however , let us not argue about whether or not to alter the guidelines ; let us discuss whether or not the substantive changes contained in our demand for the guidelines to be altered are practicable .
are you willing to listen to him ?
( applause )
mr president , i would like to welcome the spanish presidency very warmly .
the approach to be adopted by the eu should treat the issue of human rights as a fundamental factor , on the one hand , and , on the other , recognise the stabilising role of iran in the region on condition that it normalises relations with its neighbours and other international players , gives up its nuclear programme and improves human and democratic conditions .
you have to follow the ruling consistently , mr president .
secondly , everything that happens in europe takes place in the context of the treaties .
i am also of the view that the question as to who is responsible is an important one .
in writing . - ( sv ) this report , which does not form part of any legislative process , recommends a number of costly proposals , such as an eu agency for product quality and new sales promotion and sales supporting measures within agriculture .
in addition , copenhagen will only be a success story if it ensures sustainable development , if it also includes a social dimension and , in particular , if we , the developed part of the world , succeed in financing developing countries .
thank you , and i congratulate the rapporteur .
we therefore need a european spirit and we need this reform treaty !
first of all i wish to thank my colleague karl - heinz florenz for his outstanding work and his constant devotion to this issue .
they may possibly meet requirements , as you said , either by green harvesting or by destroying a small portion of the harvest in the event of small imbalances between demand and supply in normal years , but certainly not in the case of a widespread crisis such as the one we are experiencing .
the member states should enhance their cooperation and coordination so as to guarantee solidarity and the availability of additional rapid mobilisation resources to fight these disasters .
i mourn his death as both a colleague and a friend of his and i am going to ask president buzek to send his family and the spanish government a message of heartfelt condolence and support , which i am sure that all of us here share .
in general within europe this makes companies pull up their socks , improve their products and services , try harder globally .
i would like to concentrate very briefly on three key dossiers which will be under the spotlight .
there is a need to implement a new binding financial agreement that will force transnational companies to declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay , on a country by country basis , in order to ensure transparency in respect of what they pay in each of the countries in which they operate .
( laughter )
as the rapporteur also emphasises , we not only need to recognise this problem of soil deterioration , but we also have to allocate the necessary financial resources to combat its adverse effects .
secondly , the risks linked with organ transplantation continue to be a major concern .
the commission has drafted a regulation on the methods for implementing safeguard measures within the context of this agreement .
we are utterly opposed to the reflection of the new criteria in the future development of the common agricultural policy ( cap ) , as is also being argued there , so keeping this policy in the sphere of rural development with cofinancing ; in other words , retaining another way of discriminating between countries .
one practical measure which can be taken is to set up an emergency number for gender - based violence in member states .
in the process , it will destroy people 's lives .
biodiversity is restricted and the limitation of contamination can certainly not be guaranteed .
therefore , we must have a new dialogue about enlargement , as mr severin from the social democrats has proposed , which covers gradual integration and new forms of membership , in order to be able to reconcile these two legitimate objectives .
regarding the proposed exclusion of organ transplantation , i simply cannot agree .
these agreements are a milestone in our partnership , demonstrating once again the concrete benefits that our closer relationship can bring for the people of georgia .
this vast and strategically vital region is being pulled three ways : by china , by russia and by europe .
this is an important message and we will come back to this in the legislative proposals .
this applies no matter who is appointed .
as one who frequently uses the internet , writes blogs and is active on facebook and twitter , i know that there are quite a few problems here .
this balance appears difficult but it is not .
therefore , i support the report , as in my opinion this will result in costly duplicate structures , which is demonstrated , among other things , by the fact that the individual supervisory bodies are based in different cities .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 june 2008 .
( pl ) justice goldstone certainly cannot be considered a paragon of objectivity .
that is why we have voted against .
we need an assessment , based on shared values , of the crimes committed by the communist party of the soviet union and the kgb .
three principal factors have affected these relations .
the problem is that not everyone wants to recognise this kind of discrimination as a violation of human rights .
the principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments , which eight years ago , in 1999 , was described by the european council in tampere as the cornerstone of judicial cooperation , is making no progress .
2 .
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - mr president , sometimes , in this chamber , we cannot really see the political differences between groups , but , on this issue , the difference is very visible , because i could not disagree more with the rapporteur on some of the points she just mentioned .
the oie scientific and technical review identified that only 6 % of cloned embryos resulted in healthy , long - term surviving clones .
in my country , poland , despite the crisis and difficulties with transposition , it has been possible to draft a law on services which is based on a high degree of liberalisation in registering and running a business .
we are privatising state economies on the pretext of free competition , but we are nationalising relations between men and women .
on monitoring , it is our strong belief that the appropriate institution is the special commission of the hague convention on the protection of children and cooperation in respect of inter - country adoption .
while we are on the subject of common values , i would like to thank you especially , on behalf of my group , for focusing your activities on the battle to abolish the death penalty and for creating a european day against the death penalty , one of the glories of the portuguese council presidency .
at the same time , local and regional authorities will play a crucial role in promoting this database via the most suitable means possible so that the information is as easily accessible as possible to citizens .
i am pleased to note that they share our concern .
i think we are losing time in europe .
that , of course , is the responsibility of each state .
as part of the european neighbourhood policy , the european union can then initiate or support the reforms needed in the country .
it is absolutely necessary to recognise their professional status and to define their rights .
in addition , i fear that this money will be used in large part for the recruitment of non - accredited assistants under national wage terms .
budgetary planning must be founded on a realistic scenario .
parliament does not wish to go beyond its remit .
this brutal incident , the victim of which was a high - ranking state official fighting for equal rights for minorities in pakistan , is further evidence of how difficult the situation is in that country .
however , the pact seems to be having some difficulties getting off the ground , because parliament , in particular , is having to deal with a sizeable legislative package .
i support your commitment to the creation of a common energy market , interconnecting energy grids all around europe .
these weaknesses in budgetary planning do not therefore give us the guarantee of specific value for these four agencies .
thirdly , strict quality criteria must be followed and , fourthly , the member states must put in place effective monitoring mechanisms .
the debate so far leads me to believe that annex 2 will be retained in its present form .
on the other hand , while the dependence on networks and information systems increases , the ability to respond to problems still seems inadequate .
a particular example is the issue of the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons .
this initiative forms part of the global strategy to protect critical infrastructures .
it is disappointing that the ecr group and its conservative members , who are clearly against any financial transaction tax , have chosen in their statements to deliberately misrepresent today 's vote as a call for an eu - only ftt .
east timor does , however , seem to have forgotten the sacrifices it made during its war of independence to put an end to its brutal occupation by indonesia lasting 24 years , and the joy with which it celebrated its own independence .
they are based on faith not fact .
this is a call to the commission - we want measures to reduce private motoring and meat consumption so that we have more grain to feed people !
in the treaty infringement proceedings and the european court of justice , we have a powerful weapon .
in the case of credit offers , the information given to consumers will be contained in a new european credit information form .
i wholeheartedly endorse those sentiments and consider that they can be applied across the eu 's workload .
the dublin system currently in force , under which the wishes of asylum seekers , for example , their choice of a european country , cannot be taken into consideration , must be revised to the effect that people who are recognised as being in special need of protection are also able to live in another eu country .
( pl ) madam president , i would like to make sure i am understood correctly .
now is the time to bring this process finally to an end .
a year later we are still waiting for the council .
when we look at the renewable energy scenario , we should also always consider what is happening in the member states .
however , all that will be a drop in the ocean compared to what could be achieved if we had a properly functioning government .
it seeks to eliminate provisions included in previous bilateral agreements that violated union law , and which threatened equality of treatment between companies owned by nationals of different member states .
i have every confidence in this happening .
( the president cut off the speaker )
the hundreds of millions of useless chargers and adapters in europe place a ridiculous burden on the environment and , at the same time , are an expensive irritation for consumers .
in march and june 2010 , the european council adopted the europe 2020 strategy , the main priority of which is enhanced coordination of economic policy strategies in the member states and , as a long - term goal , sustainable and inclusive growth and sustainable employment .
this is the supervision package that i was referring to before and on which i had a response from mr verhofstadt .
that is why i was very willing and very happy to come to this chamber today to debate the issue of body scanners .
i have drawn attention to this issue repeatedly in the past .
a whole range of very grave issues have rightly been raised here in connection with the latest recall campaigns of an american manufacturer , which has recalled faulty products from the market at its own initiative .
that is why i expressed strong criticism , in committee too .
the united kingdom is a great nation .
the report by salvatore tatarella , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and food safety , on the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council on a community ecolabel scheme - c 6-0279/2008 - , and
what are the criteria and mechanisms for allocating these resources ?
i understand your question , but think that we also need to raise awareness and make parents more vigilant , because rogue traders will always exist .
with regard to visa facilitation , we have begun talks in the council .
i am going to listen to you closely as i am convinced that perfecting the right of asylum is an important issue for the future and , i would say , for our design of europe which must remain true to its great tradition of welcoming people .
by voting in favour of the report as a whole , i am supporting the many good elements it contains , but i also recognise the fact that the majority sees nuclear energy as part of europe 's co 2 - free energy mix .
i also believe that croatia 's accession will accelerate the integration of the whole region of the former yugoslavia into the eu , in particular as montenegro 's rapporteur and a strong friend of serbia .
i support the strengthening of the ' data protection ' element and the fact that the judicial network contact points are to provide the national members of eurojust with certain information .
consumer safety is of even greater importance when it aims to safeguard the authenticity of medicinal products sold on the open market , whether through traditional channels or over the internet .
the available data show that some countries are affected to a greater extent than others by the gathering pace of global warming .
we talk a lot about national and international economies , but the local economy is crucially important : people 's access to banking , even if they are not very well off , to microcredit and to credit unions .
transatlantic economic cooperation is not directed against anybody .
paragraph 4 of the resolution asks the government - the very same sri lankan government - to investigate their own serious human rights violations .
at this time of economic crisis , when the fight against tax fraud is all the more important given the seriousness of loss of revenue , we must make every effort to combat it , as this will have an important impact not only on our response to the current international crisis , but also on the possibility of pursuing the appropriate social policies .
( pl ) mr president , i think that this is a unique coincidence , because i am going to speak about the very same topic .
the commission 's green paper refers mostly to a smoke - free environment , and the debate mainly focused on that area .
the multitude of reasons and proposed political solutions are contained in the opinion of the committee on women 's rights and gender equality .
( pt ) the pressure being exerted by the commission and the great powers of europe on the countries with more fragile economies and higher levels of poverty flies in the face of all the principles of economic and social cohesion that the belgian presidency has spoken about here in the name of the so - called ' social clause ' of the treaty of lisbon - article 9 .
in the eu , women are still severely under - represented in decision making , caring responsibilities fall almost entirely on women 's shoulders and there is still a persistent income gap between men and women , including outside the eu , where some countries have not even begun working on giving women the franchise .
it is not acceptable for women to be subjected to bullying and physical or psychological violence on a daily basis .
i listened very carefully to the comments by mr degutis .
i would like to underline once again , that easy access by petitioners to the information they need should be the foundation for the success of the european transparency initiative .
the struggle against inequality in and outside the workplace is a fundamental task for us .
if the eu were to maintain relations only with countries that respect human rights as we defend them , then our firm relations would extend to only a few countries .
preparation of the european council ( 11-12 december 2008 ) ( debate )
in writing . - i welcome this report as an important step forward in the battle against dementia .
we must respect both .
the commission must manage the interconnection of these systems and expand their functionality in order to streamline costs .
this is an important venture but , at the same time , i would like to take this opportunity of stressing that there are , in fact , national centres , and also numerous european colleges with experience in training personnel .
all the member states should benefit from the boost and the resulting recovery , whilst not all of them can contribute to the same extent because their starting situations are different .
pierre werner , a former prime minister of luxembourg , along with valéry giscard d'estaing and helmut schmidt , when they were still finance ministers , submitted blueprints heading in this direction .
members of the council , i ask you therefore to note that not merely the new member states are involved .
( fr ) madam president , as a result of the austerity policy conducted by the cameron government , the united kingdom has just decided to stop funding the large tugboats designed to assist and rescue ships in the english channel , a unilateral decision that has been condemned by the port , maritime , trading and political bodies of that area .
why ?
particular attention must therefore be given to protecting intellectual property .
president of the commission . - mr president , let me complement prime minister reinfeldt 's assessment of the european council by commenting on two aspects , one on policy and one on institutional issues .
the commission is currently carrying out research and fact - finding on information to consumers at the point of sale , and it intends to consult retail experts , consumer organisations and other stakeholders on the ground before proposing concrete measures .
on the one hand , we are talking about a community with a common destiny .
some members have referred to the social clause , proposal 29 , and i think that proposal 30 is very important .
at times of crisis , capital looks for low - risk areas , and there is the chance to invest in new greenfield technologies rather than in unviable industries .
let me ask you this : when , if not now , should this action be initiated ?
we wanted , in this way , to underline the importance we place on the fight against intolerance based on belief or religion .
in conditions such as that , which will become ever more frequent as a result of global warming , the local resources were stretched to the limit , despite the fact that , in previous years , the weather was milder and corsica had been spared .
i hope that the european parliament 's decision will be approved by the council and that the new provision will even enter into force this year .
but , as president sarkozy said yesterday here in parliament , we need to maintain our domestic sources of food .
today we want to hear how the outgoing czech presidency sees the past six months and what conclusions and principal comments it has about what we should do in the near future .
commissioner , your diagnosis of a lack of interconnection could not be more accurate .
it is unfortunate that indifference is particularly great in central and eastern european countries , the roots of which is once again to be sought in the inadequacy of information , but another contributing factor is that the pace of catching up after the great wave of enlargement has slowed down and caused disappointment .
europe is still not a whole and our fundamental objective is to take this process on .
we all agree , but the efforts must be joint or not at all .
how many times must it be said in this house that , because it nourishes people , because it helps to make the countryside more attractive and to keep populations in rural areas , agriculture cannot be considered as an economic activity like any other ?
however , we regret , commissioner , that the action plan contains too few practical measures .
explanations of vote
in slaughterhouses , official inspectors perform food safety controls , mainly on carcasses .
as more than fifteen members have asked for the floor , we are going to hear the first five .
i am particularly pleased that the eu has now introduced energy labelling of domestic appliances .
the first is that if there is no legislative initiative , if the council and the commission do not bring legislative acts to fill up the programme , then obviously the programme cannot succeed .
i would expect you to talk about the social agenda , and the social failing that was conspicuous by its absence from the summit discussion : the 70 million poor , 20 million of whom are children .
today we can talk of the traditional and folk culture in historically undeveloped regions , but we cannot say very much about their existence in developing regions .
violence and hatred cannot be accepted in the name of religion .
vice - president of the commission . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , let me give warm thanks to mrs angelilli for this report .
tomorrow i think there is an opportunity for parliament to show that we not only sing our own arias of regret and anger and play the blame game , but we can make a real contribution constructively to establish leadership and pick up on very concrete proposals that the european commission could immediately initiate .
our involvement has always been in line with the principle of solidarity , but also of responsibility .
we cannot separate respect for a better balance between the principle of protecting health and safety from that of equality of treatment .
in the eu , we kill over one and a half million children before birth every year .
the next item is the report by mrs gebhardt , on behalf of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , on implementation of the services directive [ ( 2006/123 / ec ) .
this is not just about mandatory national requirements , but about specific projects .
we will continue to firmly and vehemently oppose arguments for the irrational criteria of the stability pact , and for exchange policy guidelines and other macro - economic guidelines , as well as the devaluing of production and labour - in which vítor constâncio has played a central role - as we have always done .
in writing . - ( sv ) we welcome the fact that the resolution demands an immediate stop to israel 's killing of the inhabitants of gaza .
ireland has not ratified .
i hope that the message is not that if alcohol is drunk in small quantities , no amount will prove harmful .
this is a most fundamental point .
despite this , women are still not worth as much as men - either when it comes to pay or influence - both in society and in the workplace .
( de ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it would seem that some groups are very sure that it is right for us now to seek a very ambitious free trade agreement with japan .
mr davis , at its meeting last wednesday , the euro - mediterranean parliamentary assembly , which i myself chaired , adopted a resolution on the tragic situation in the middle east .
since yours is a small country , you might be able to diagnose why we never arrive at solutions .
we have therefore chosen to support the report .
in writing . - i voted for this uncontroversial report , which endorses the proposal for a regulation on the conclusion of a new fisheries partnership agreement between the european community and mozambique .
it is because governments have a feeling that , if everything was said clearly , and if the citizens of eu member states knew the consequences , if they knew the reasons why we want to make such important decisions , the uncertainty of those reasons and the uncertainty of the consequences of our actions , they would be opposed to it all .
coordination between the various policy areas and levels of management along with the involvement of the private sector are crucial for the effective implementation of these measures .
it also seeks to promote the development of filtering systems and to encourage the labelling of internet sites deemed safe for children .
i have already mentioned the energy community treaty , and we will also use the existing mechanisms within the framework of the european neighbourhood policy .
in the context of the overall developments , the eu 's common agricultural policy appears very inflexible and rigid .
i would therefore be most interested to know how you managed to converse with him , mr president .
as foreign minister at the time when visa requirements for bulgaria were lifted , i know the great emotional effect the visa waiver and ending of humiliation had on our citizens .
on behalf of the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe , however , i would like to say that , in any case , we still have the goal of establishing a common , eu - wide asylum system by 2012 .
scientific cooperation with africa ( debate )
our fellow citizens , however , wish to see a europe that provides solutions to the challenges of globalisation .
although the quality of healthcare in europe has improved substantially due to advances in medical science , medical procedures can sometimes damage patients ' health .
in my view at least - and this is actually a real disgrace - you have failed to respect the objectives on poverty , based on the fallacy that further consideration is needed .
my own thought was that this was a very low threshold : it comprises the danger that we give such resources to very small , possibly unrepresentative and even extreme groups .
it failed to respond to the need to protect the climate or to the demands of the energy crisis and we are again passing up an opportunity to ensure there is constructive pressure here until well into the next decade .
it is a wide social and political question that is also connected with implementation of the lisbon strategy . if increasing numbers of people become ill , we will not be able to achieve higher productivity and better competitiveness .
a third important area is the construction industry .
therefore , it is important that parliament has an influence on future processes .
it grows organically ; it develops naturally within a people and , in its way , this report precisely demonstrates the structural flaw at the heart of the european project .
the truth is that mr de castro and the other previous speakers are quite right in saying that the commission and the council did not do enough during the health check to prevent this crisis .
the last century , with its climaxes and terrible low points , has taught us one thing .
we must ensure that the non - lcd countries also get an agreement and are not left out , and we must ensure that all the countries can develop in the right direction .
through recourse to half - truths and sometimes even lies , they try to manipulate european public opinion in their favour .
in writing . - ( ro ) it is clear that , for each commitment period in the union 's programme in which aviation is included , it is required that the objectives assigned to this sector be established in convergence with and according to the average efforts required of all the other fixed - source sectors in all the member states .
during the multilateral trade negotiations europe did what it had to do and , as you know , made a number of concessions in regard to reforms , in the framework of the cap agreements .
and what about the european commission ?
( hu ) i am pleased that my fellow members are so outraged about the heavy - handed infringements of human rights taking place in guantánamo in the name of combating terrorism .
the council has proposed too many exceptions from the requirement to carry a ce mark , and it is essential to revise and limit this as far as possible , otherwise the entire ce marking system will become meaningless .
we support the rapporteur 's positions on market instruments and risk management in terms of crises , epidemics , animal welfare and the environment , modulation and degressivity .
secondly , will this model take account of the climatic and environmental objectives set by the eu ?
the disputes between the democratically elected president and the generals in mauritania in their attitude to extremist islamism contributed to the coup .
for the above - mentioned reasons our group will not support the resolution .
at the same time , we consider it necessary to implement comprehensive employment and environmental initiatives in those regions affected by the closures that will probably result from the discontinuation of the subsidies .
even after the decisions of the european court on 12 december 2006 , when it returned a judgment of deficient controls and failure to comply with the necessary measures to protect human rights , the european union made only superficial changes .
mr president , frankly we should thank mr farage for his contribution to the irish campaign .
the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon would provide a clear legal basis for eu legal provisions in this area .
i voted in favour of the changes proposed by the rapporteur .
( hu ) thank you for the floor , mr president .
that is why i would like to point out that the single market is now in danger .
in other words , our words must be followed up by tangible action .
in relation to this , i would like to recall the european court of human rights ' finding in the case of bosphorus airlines vs. ireland in 2005 .
there are so many ' services ' but among them there is one which is very controversial : abortion .
the recycling of waste in europe has been accorded an important place in this part - session : with the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment and the resolution on the management of waste in campania , we have voiced our opinion on a subject that is both technical and political .
today 's agreement is another time - buying exercise .
even when what is now sudan was known as anglo - egyptian sudan , it was debatable whether this huge area with widely differing populations should become independent as a single state .
let us say loudly and clearly that , in order to import any kind of product to the eu , irrespective of whether this is shoes or beef , specific standards must be met .
it is worth pointing out the obvious willingness of the eu institutions and bodies to see complaints to the ombudsman as an opportunity to remedy any mistakes made and to cooperate with the ombudsman on behalf of citizens .
for example , i welcome forms which would give citizens the opportunity to add their name directly to the organ donor register when they apply for a driving licence .
well , it comes from our new function as parliament , as a body which has been given legislative powers .
unfortunately , the restricted budget amount within the ceiling laid down in the financial framework means that the resources needed to finance the new priorities must be sought within the confines of the existing budget , and we have to redistribute resources .
some people , such as monks , were prevented from being able to vote .
in particular , support must be provided for the institutions that have just been set up in belarus .
the failure to adopt safeguards for the protection of personal data processed in the field of police and judicial cooperation at eu level and in relations with third countries , particularly with the us ( e.g. air passenger data ) ;
we support you in what you are saying about the import controls and about fmd .
following the close attention paid by the international public to the post - election period in iran and the street demonstrations that the iranian regime sought to repress with the use of violence , it is important to ensure that silence does not descend on the situation in the country .
i should point out that the text of the agreement reached in the council envisages derogations or exceptions for such countries and for such markets , up until their isolation is remedied .
thus , in addition to the correction of 1 600 million in the multiannual financial framework , with the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument it is also proposed to supplement the funding for the european global navigation satellite system programmes ( egnos - galileo ) by approximately eur 200 million .
what is important is what parliament has achieved , namely that the new approach will be implemented to a lesser extent and its application must be assessed on a case - by - case basis .
finally , mr president , it is not clear what position the portuguese presidency will adopt on euro - atlantic cooperation .
( the president cut off the speaker )
( explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rules of procedure )
it is true that there has been some progress and that people 's awareness regarding this subject has increased somewhat , but the european union 's new political priorities are indispensable for combating violence against women more effectively and for achieving our common objective that women and children should not constantly live in fear of falling victim to violence .
ban ki - moon urged all international actors to focus on the efforts for such a settlement .
mr president , if the debate today had had as its subject the situation in the gaza strip , i might have joined mrs de keyser and all the other colleagues across the floor in claiming the same positions .
this would mark an important step towards simplification , given that hitherto , the european community has just adopted annual regulations for the purpose of adapting and updating the existing rules .
in this sense , the nabucco project is a strategic project for the european union .
it is very important that we work together at a global level to try and resolve the problems .
secondly , the use of the pesticide methyl bromide will be prohibited as of 18 march 2010 .
i feel that all the ep groups have reached a major compromise to secure this agreement .
our proposal sends a strong signal that we cannot stand by while women fall into poverty through a lack of social protection .
christianity is one of the cornerstones of european action and european thought and we very much respect the fact that you have reformed the communist media legislation in hungary which dates back to 1986 .
i have actively sought a climate policy for europe through emissions trading legislation , one that would not only be ambitious , but also rational , so that we would not simply be moving emissions from one place to another .
i think it should be stressed that our line is absolutely clear .
it will then remain for the provisions of this convention to be actually implemented , which will not be easy , but let us consider nonetheless that the approach is positive .
what monumental undemocratic arrogance it is to suggest that members of this parliament should have their questions to the council and commission censored !
this kind of action is contrary to the existing solidarity principle within the european union .
i wonder what the world is coming to when the european union , the self - styled protector of universal , interdependent and indivisible human rights , fails to speak out clearly against one of the world 's worst human rights abusers .
the eu - russia strategic partnership must - as was said before - be based on common commitments in the area of human rights and democracy .
they therefore deserve to be included in the discussion on cohesion policy after 2013 .
( bg ) mr president , mr šefčovič , ladies and gentlemen , discussing the work programme of the european commission is not merely a formality .
hitherto moldova has fully exhausted the quota it was allocated , therefore an increase in duty free tariff quotas will enable moldova to increase sales of its production in the eu , without damaging the eu 's wine industry .
there must be a european framework within which everyone is treated equally .
thirdly , the european union must stress the need to improve relations between afghanistan and pakistan - as several of you mentioned - and to encourage both countries to continue to work actively to strengthen their cooperation , notably in the fight against the common challenge posed by terrorism and in all matters relating to drug trafficking .
therefore , i support this proposal .
ukraine is still deciding which model of civilisation it should subscribe to .
savings were made in some budget lines by working out the budget on the basis of real expenditure rather than index - linked calculations .
like many members , i welcome the initiative taken by the edps and the assistant edps to publish an annual declaration of their financial interests , in a form similar to that of members of the european parliament .
in future , whenever a change is made in one agricultural area , there is the possibility that changes will be made in another area .
this is definitely an investment in the future that will help prevent or reduce healthcare expenditure arising from unhealthy eating habits .
the international rules on trade defence are being renegotiated in the world trade organisation ( wto ) .
one step forward would be agreement on the proposal for a directive on a single permit which provides for a common set of rights for third country workers residing legally in a member state .
as you know it is a difficult subject , which i think we need to tackle very carefully , as we cannot afford to get it wrong .
in writing . - ( pl ) the european globalisation adjustment fund was set up to provide additional support to workers affected by the consequences of major structural changes in global trade .
the question of translation raised here is not a question of language , it is not a question of transparency , it is not a question of style .
furthermore , i share the anger of some of my fellow members regarding the syrian exception and now the exception for bashar al-assad , who has avoided sanctions .
it is important that we maintain the momentum to complete the internal market and break down barriers to trade .
( it ) commissioner , before the end of next month , the european commission will formulate the proposal for the new multiannual financial framework for the period from 2014 to 2020 .
regional policy suffers from the complexity of its procedures , which often deter local players from having recourse to it .
i wish , secondly , to speak about globalisation .
the nomads of the planet keep on the move because they want to eat and drink , look after themselves and educate themselves .
commissioner , can you personally offer any explanation of how the proportionality requirements should be interpreted and arrange for this to be taken over by the council ?
there are two options open to us : we can split ourselves into our constituent parts , ranging in size from germany , with a population of 82 million , to malta with a population of 360 000 .
what matters is , and in that respect i totally agree with the rapporteur , that you have to look very carefully at how this instrument can be best used and when usefulness and need are really defined .
i should point out that the regulation governing the solidarity fund normally allows its mobilisation only for what are known as ' major disasters ' , where the damage at national level exceeds the threshold of 0.6 % of gross national income , or eur 3 billion at 2002 prices .
the threat - and it is a threat - that limiting the level of the european union budget will have a detrimental effect on european solidarity and the pace of economic development in the member states is both facile and displays an overwhelming ignorance of the impact of the crisis upon european citizens .
finally , on the european external action service : i think the forming of the eeas should be based on a fair geographical balance and equal opportunities for representatives of all member states , new and old , with application of the quota system .
during yesterday 's vote in the european parliament , i voted in favour of the resolution on the climate change conference in cancún ( cop 16 ) .
we concentrate , therefore , on some strategic and geographical priority areas such as the western balkans , the middle east and the broader middle east , south caucasus , africa and asia , and obviously relations with our strategic partner , the usa , as well as relations with russia .
personally , i agree with the majority of this house that we need binding targets .
the next item is the vote .
it has been proposed by the commission and parliament that greening services be provided , in return for payment , as ' top ups ' to the basic premium .
the next item is the report by bogusław liberadzki , on behalf of the committee on transport and tourism , on the proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council on the inland transport of dangerous goods - c 6-0012/2007 - .
thanks to the treaty of lisbon , we finally have the clear institutional framework for tackling all the challenges facing the modern world .
the carabinieri have no business searching a school .
i also believe that in a difficult situation , we need to make courageous decisions .
the new member states should take part in the preparation of plans for neighbourhood policy implementation activities , ensure a higher degree of participation by national parliaments and increase the activity of ngos .
a compromise was reached during conciliation and it seems , mr stockmann , that these amendments are therefore no longer necessary at this stage .
if the documents are not credible , that fact should be drawn to the attention of the country concerned .
however , i have two points to make .
we have been devoting considerable efforts to this end , and we want to devote equal , if not greater , efforts to this priority in the two months remaining to us .
personally , i am in favour of maintaining the best possible relations with turkey and other muslim states , but it is not in europe 's interest to allow constant humiliation of a christian country whilst favouring muslim ones .
i should like to thank the european parliament once again for its significant contribution in keeping the environmental objective of the proposal intact and achieving agreement at first reading .
i am certain that in the future these will prove to be the right guidelines and the right bases for a policy that will make europe stronger and more competitive .
( es ) please allow me a few seconds to begin by congratulating the high representative , the council , the commission and the rotating presidency of the european union for the speed , coordination and effort they have shown from the outset .
i am doubtful whether this situation can be changed in the short - term .
a major change in climate will also bring something quite different : disease epidemics and epizootics among both people and animals .
such a mission will also face threats from rebel groups holding out against the government , but it appears based on a thorough assessment recently carried out in this region that all these challenges are surmountable .
it is necessary to check whether union funds are being well used , whether these institutions are meeting the objectives outlined for them , and whether any resources are being wasted .
the president - in - office gave a very comprehensive point of view about the gsp negotiations , but in light of his reservations , or of reservations about sri lanka at the moment , how confident is he at this stage that sri lanka will satisfy those 27 conditions to which he referred , which must be met before they can actually get this preferential system of trading ?
i also see a need for a review of the eu 's own resources system .
it is also thanks to parliament , and , in particular , president pöttering , who will be hosting the signing of a joint tripartite declaration , establishing european maritime day , later today .
the left wing majority has shown today that european institutions do not want to reduce the bureaucracy funded by taxpayers ' money .
we must never lose sight of the fact that the best interests of the child are paramount , and accordingly , i voted in favour of this resolution .
however , let us take this urgency session in which we are discussing breaches of human rights and democracy a lot more seriously , because , if we do not we are going to lose all the credibility that we currently have , and this is clearly difficult to regain at international level .
i specifically want to address the call to widen the school milk scheme .
healthcare must be left up to the member states .
( fr ) madam president , the report by our colleague ria oomen - ruijten is thorough , honest and courageous at a very testing time for turkey , and i wish to congratulate her on this .
on the limitation of liability , we need to find a way to combine certainty on the part of the shipowner regarding the liability it is assuming and the amount of damages that it might incur , with certainty on the part of potential victims that they will receive compensation .
it is true that , when negotiating with you , we always know where we are .
( nl ) mr president , in life , and certainly in politics , hope is very important .
as such , i welcome the european parliament 's awareness of the fact that in the future russia will be unable to meet the internal and contractual demand for gas , and that it expresses its concern in this regard .
i am pleased that the commission has highlighted the subject of efficient and responsible raw material use , and i also consider it important that we are going to discuss rare earths soon .
i was interested in the comments made by catherine day , a senior commission official , in ireland last week when she said that the shine had gone off ireland .
these agreements must constitute proper partnerships that will make for the establishment of a new economic and trading environment to promote development in all the territories concerned .
fourthly , the free movement of goods and services has opened up new opportunities for business .
i think there is a reassurance here that it is not only in parliament ' interests , but also in the commission 's and the council 's interests to proceed very quickly .
what assurances is the commission able to give that some conditions will be levelled to avoid any distortions in the compensation handed out at member state level and to ensure a level playing field ?
europe is today anxious to support the people of tunisia in the democratic transition that is beginning .
as you have rightly said , it is estimated that by 2050 , the number of people with dementia will have doubled in europe .
i now come to my role as shadow rapporteur for the alde , and will outline some of the guiding principles of our approach .
our group feels it is of the utmost importance to give the eu every chance in the light of globalisation , and to reform it as the european commission has proposed most energetically since 2005 under president josé manuel barroso .
by last year , 2006 , the level had fallen to 15.3 % .
madam president , every year , within the territory of the european union , there are around one million people working whilst posted to a country other than the one where the head office of the company employing them is located .
( the president cut off the speaker )
the measures proposed in this area should be welcomed .
he says ' i wish to bring to your urgent attention the civilian deaths in sri lanka .
in order for this not to happen , directive 2003/41 / ec should at least ensure that employees must be kept informed directly or indirectly by trustees about the type and risk of the investment of their pensions and they must be given a voice in decisions .
( nl ) madam president , with only one minute speaking time , all i can do is plead with the czech presidency to help us ensure the european institutions respect democracy .
if we do not want poles to be second - class citizens in the eu , the charter of fundamental rights must be adopted in its entirety .
i welcome the changes in the area of freedom , security and justice , where action will have more ambitious goals and more effective procedures , no longer using intergovernmental instruments and procedures .
of course , this does not mean that i am declaring my opposition to further regional integration in south east asia .
in several countries , and especially in greece , our fellow citizens are confused , anxious and deeply concerned about their and their children 's future .
the citizens want to decide themselves whether they will hand over their sovereign rights to a european super - state without a democratic or historical framework .
secondly , we must no longer impose double penalties on taxpayers .
we should be able to freeze trade agreements until we can see that the demands we have rightly made are being complied with , until for example the governments in the relevant countries invest sufficient resources in finding and bringing to justice the authors of the crimes .
to date , in east jerusalem , the eu is implementing activities costing eur 4.6 million .
but maybe we have an answer to that .
i would also like to say to mr dimas that i appreciate very much what he said today .
it should not be forgotten that the edf does not fall within the commission 's general financial aid , and therefore we can demand clear transparency and specific objectives for which this money is going to be used .
the eu is thus skirting the original aim of the package itself , namely job creation .
we must work of course especially , as we have said , in areas like the middle east , which means that we have to continue to put pressure on iran and address the issues that are raised there .
we must put an end to this now , and hopefully we shall do so tomorrow .
at the moment , for example , in the case of emissions trading , talks are based not on parliament 's opinion but only on the decision of a single committee .
president of the commission . - we are taking that exercise very seriously .
( the oral amendment was accepted )
i called on vietnam to accommodate all the religions represented on its territory and to allow its population to choose their form of worship freely .
( fr ) madam president , i should like to make a number of comments .
at this juncture , i would also like to point out that those who always claim that the european integration project is an anti - social project could perhaps tone it down a little from today onwards .
you are one of the better paid people in europe , just like i am.
in fact , the fate of the ancient city of kashgar is in the balance .
( it ) mr president , commissioner , schengen is certainly an heirloom of civilisation of the highest value .
what kind of signal is the council giving by proposing a drastic reduction in resources in paragraph 1a ?
i am convinced that there is a common will .
( ro ) mr president , i am going to vote tomorrow on the legislative package on european economic governance .
the games are an outstanding opportunity for the chinese people to come into contact with sporting and cultural values from the rest of the world .
the first priority must now be accorded to poverty reduction .
it is important to have made some progress in this direction with mr vlasák 's report , with which i strongly agree , and i believe that this report will allow us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce tools such as the municipal operational programmes as operational programmes capable of giving a new quality to cohesion policy .
furthermore , we are also , specifically , experiencing very determined and clear action by the european union to support financial stability in the euro area .
allow me now to move more specifically to the three countries before us .
i also welcome the annual publication of declarations of financial interests of the elected members of the european data protection supervisor ( edps ) , containing relevant information on remunerated posts or activities and declarable professional activities .
the financial sector and big business continue to accumulate colossal profits , and the unsustainable extortion of national resources by means of interest paid on the sovereign debt of countries like portugal continues .
the levels of profitability of retail banking vary widely , and establishments in the nordic countries , spain and ireland are above average .
prüm treaty : cross - border cooperation in combating terrorism and cross - border crime ( vote )
however , the commission undertook to draft a legislative proposal along these lines , and you , commissioner , kept this promise .
we could not agree with the european council on a common approach .
temporary suspension of internet access , as part of a graduated response and with respect for individual freedoms , would be an appropriate solution that would also prevent the application of criminal sanctions , the limits of which are clear nowadays .
subject : progress on the temporary agency workers directive
what we need is a new treaty for a new era .
we have concluded this session .
member of the commission . - i completely agree with the question raised on the consequences for the primary producer , for the farmer .
in many of its resolutions , the european parliament has highlighted the fact that women play a vital role in promoting dialogue and peace , as was also underlined at the conference that we organised on the occasion of international women 's day .
the natural catastrophes which have been blighting the world , such as the earthquakes and deadly storms that we have recently witnessed in the eu , make us rethink the paradigm of humanitarian aid and of emergencies , which require a swift , agile and concerted answer .
i think this is an important concept to keep in mind .
therefore , seeking to now expel three companies from the system would only lead to a reduction in that competition , which , as we are all aware , benefits consumers .
( el ) mr president , commissioner , thank you for your informative reply .
( the sitting was suspended at 13.25 and resumed at 15.00 )
in defending the interests of the eu fisheries sector in trade negotiations , the commission also seeks to remove any trade barrier maintained by our trade partners that might threaten the export potential of the eu industry , with the aim of ensuring a level playing field in bilateral and multilateral trade in fish products .
it is very good that the eu is coordinating social security schemes , as , in the enlarged european union , millions of persons work beyond the borders of their own countries .
i voted for this resolution because the european union must play a leading role in climate change negotiations , as trust in the international negotiations on climate change needs to be restored after the disappointing outcome of the climate conference in copenhagen .
i would like to start with that because it has been a unique experience for me .
the commission should table a proposal amending the regulation in terms of the management structures of the european gnss programmes .
this directive should be a general framework directive on rights for third - country workers and should serve as a framework for specific directives , because only then will the european union goal of a common migration policy be achieved .
therefore , the problem now arises of an appropriate reaction from competition protection agencies concerning access to technical information , spare parts and authorised service stations , and also concerning the abuse of guarantees .
the vote on the estrela report will take place on wednesday , 20 october .
black sheep in the feed industry have caused great economic losses in agriculture and far beyond .
( el ) thank you , commissioner , for your reply .
if , on the other hand , the animal welfare standards used for research purposes resulted in the exporting of research , the impact would then be more obvious in those countries which already operate under strict regulatory controls , such as switzerland and the united kingdom .
the european union cannot accommodate all the destitute people in the world , but it should make a contribution that is in proportion to its wealth , its needs and the damage that it has caused and that is still being caused today by some of its companies , which are plundering those countries ' resources .
( pt ) - i should like to take this opportunity to express our solidarity with the soldiers and leaders of associations representing members of the armed forces who are the subject of disciplinary procedures in relation to their activity in such associations , for exercising and upholding the legitimate rights of members of the armed forces in portugal , especially as regards the whole range of social and professional matters which these associations seek to promote as part of a necessary enhancement of the dignity of military life .
( bg ) mr president , it is a pleasure for me to be participating in the discussion of this document , which highlights that the best basis for the future of all the countries in the region is their full integration as member states of the european union .
therefore , let us welcome favourably the commission 's proposal for a radical reform of the european network and information security agency ( enisa ) and the extension of its mandate for another 18 months , which will allow us to overcome the risk of a dangerous legal vacuum .
i do not know if fellow members know of the existence of an organisation called the parents circle .
hopefully , we will have some easy ones to deal with , too .
in this debate , it is essential to be sensible and to find a solution which takes into account both animal welfare and the economic interests at stake .
the current troubles are not caused by the euro ; on the contrary , the euro protects us from even worse .
the commission states that ' as the general level of imports from moldova is merely 0.04 % of all eu imports , further market opening is not expected to create negative effects for the eu .
the jobs related to this business can easily be reoriented .
i agree with some of the previous speakers and like them i want to express my fundamental disagreement with this report because of one key problem : the failure to approve key amendments which would have corrected what was originally a bad report .
i think that is an enormous difference , because the semi - automatic character of sanctions in the commission proposal is not present in the deauville proposal .
decisions concerning certain documents : see minutes
this is a small step forward in the protection of motherhood and fatherhood , which are fundamental rights and values of our society .
countless cases of fraud occur in the field of value added tax , so it is essential to have a legal framework with strong measures so as to bring about a substantial reduction in the number of such cases .
we must protect intellectual property more effectively , we must press harder for global rules and standards , we must strengthen the wto , and we must practise transatlantic partnership .
the question is : do we really want a european market where a third of the energy provided is renewable energy ?
marvellous , we are pleased - as you have heard - but that is certainly not enough for us .
if there is a message in this vote , it is that the vast majority of us are intent on warning the council against any attempt to reduce the european budget .
does anybody really believe that we , the member states , the state or the community will be able to solve the problem of investment ?
that would lead only to a form of legalised deportation of children , which is not what haiti needs .
they must first , and above all , continue to be recognised as means of liberation for the greatest number of people and as instruments for sharing knowledge and know - how .
this is coming late , really late .
if there were no budget , then the funding could not be made available .
however , call a spade a spade !
the difficult issues on the agenda must be tackled , and targets must be set now that are much firmer , clearer and binding .
the council has a certain margin and foundation on which to build , even it is based on the past , which we may think is not particularly well - balanced .
( fi ) madam president , the debate on the very recent european chemicals regulation , reach , is still in our memories .
firstly , the pittsburgh conclusions mention the need to make the beneficiaries of rescue measures contribute to the cost of those measures .
common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector ( vote )
first , to provide for the necessary follow - up on the relevant part of article 53b on the financial regulation , which stipulates that the transparency obligation and ex post publication of beneficiaries by the member states must be ensured by sector - specific legislation .
it will ease the burden of the conditions required in return for obtaining public funding and will broaden the options for making use of this funding .
- madam president , i supported this report mainly because the paragraphs i had some concern about were either deleted or modified in a way which i felt was appropriate .
on 14 april 2011 , the commission adopted a proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egf ) in favour of belgium , with a view to supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis .
i think that it must be extended in order to achieve legal certainty and guarantee the interests of both the eu and the beneficiary countries .
i voted in favour of the own - initiative report by my german fellow member mr piecyk on an integrated maritime policy for the european union , drawn up in response to a communication from the commission on the same subject .
despite problems , i believe that there are already channels for dialogue which can prove very useful .
furthermore , i believe that the next steps must be far more effective and tougher on the part of both the european commission and the czech presidency .
( nl ) mr president , the only reason - at least the way i see it - to look seriously at this proposal at all is that it creates a european framework for member states to work within , which ultimately benefits the internal market .
this means that the current legislation may not be up to date .
small and medium - sized enterprises are the engine and the main players in the current economic recovery .
we need to ask for more commitment , in particular from the big emerging economies , china , india and brazil , always within the framework of the world trade organisation .
if we can include this in the process that we are now celebrating , the five years since expansion , then we will be ready for further processes and for the future .

in all cases , however , the mother is assured protection in case of illness , even after the maternity leave has ended .
finally , one of our tasks in the eu is to make a positive impact on the lives of citizens and to add value at european level .
you are doing yourselves no favours , even as supporters of the european project , if you hand your taxpayers ' money to these schemes with a ' europe right or wrong ' attitude , without stopping to look at whether it is being efficaciously spent or whether it is being lost or stolen .
however - and , yes , i am echoing your words here , commissioner - this summit still had two virtues .
so my question to the council is : how are you going to address this next week ?
developing countries are facing difficulties establishing tax systems ( the establishment , collection and administration of taxes ) .
the report on developing an eu strategy for the black sea region offers an overview of the future challenges for the region , but it will also be relevant for establishing solid channels with the state partners in the region to ensure its smooth and effective implementation .
we have all undertaken to apply the ' polluter pays ' principle , but this also means that those who bring the costs into being must also pay the price .
it is essential to create the stability needed to guarantee the security of supplies to eu member states and their consumers .
indeed , the proposal for a common approach , insofar as possible , to the structure and functioning of these agencies is aimed at cutting red tape so that these bodies can carry out their legislative role in a proper and effective manner .
we call for the removal of obstacles to the mutual recognition of qualifications and the modernisation of our european universities with financial backing from the eu .
it is an undeniable fact that , until now , even with the stability and growth pact , even with a european central bank , the external representation of the eu in international financial bodies has fallen far short of the actual importance of economic and monetary union and what the european union project represents .
i believe that the system of geological storage of carbon dioxide is possibly the best solution in the current context .
i also thank the high representative - and we will discuss this further on 23 april - for agreeing to be present at the hearing of the committee on foreign affairs on the subject of the external service , which we will have the chance to discuss in greater depth .
in developing countries , particularly in rural areas , women urgently need universal access to general health care , medical assistance and advice on pregnancy and childbirth .
it is therefore urgent to break the stalemate on this issue , as there are many possible solutions .
mr president , the combined topics of this morning 's debate have a strong common theme of our continued response to the financial crisis and to finding ways to make our management of the risk more effective , whether it be risk management of public debt , risk management of our financial markets and products , or the risk management of global imbalances .
( fr ) madam president , i would like , in a way , to echo the opinion of mrs durant , who rightly affirmed that social housing is not a commercial sector or a sector subject to competition like any other .
i would also like to pay tribute to mr lehne , not only for his efficiency and work in steering the private company statute through the consultation procedure , but also for the interesting and creative solutions presented in the report .
just last month , a group boasting over a thousand members was created on the networking site facebook which openly glorified the genocide in srebrenica .
it sounds like zero sense to me .
( de ) mr president , mrs wallström , mrs malmström , ladies and gentlemen , the treaty of lisbon must now enter into force and be implemented quickly .
with regard to those amendments , i would emphasise that member states do , in fact , already consult trade associations in order to make sure that they have the support of producers .
i think that it is important for us to discuss this topic , even though the accident did not occur in an area under the jurisdiction of a european union member state .
in addition to the six strategic investment sectors specified , i think that new projects need to be launched in areas such as food , agriculture and culture .
( applause )
however , i also take the view - and i fully endorse what hans - peter mayer has said on this point , and jacques toubon also touched upon this - that this early involvement of the various stakeholders can , of course , only be successful if the legal bases are available in all the languages .
with the liberalisation , consumers will benefit directly from the increased competition and the completion of the internal market .
it is wholly unacceptable that , after all these years , hundreds of thousands of people should still be living in such degrading conditions .
the constitution fails to provide an eu - conforming , modern , administrative structure .
on behalf of the s&d group . - mr president , first of all , i want to thank the council and commission for their statements today and i want to thank the alde group , the greens / efa group and the gue / ngl group for their support in having this matter on today 's agenda .
the jobs that illegal migrants fill are often jobs that could be filled by citizens of member states and the conditions and pay are frequently below the minimum .

the vote will take place on tuesday , 10 march 2009 .
when the regulation introducing de minimis aid was adopted in 2007 , it was thought that it would not affect trade or distort competition .
however , i must admit that i have a slight reservation about the fact that we must manage to draw a precise distinction between unesco 's world cultural heritage programme and the european character of this label .
the mediterranean manages the affairs of the women and men of the mediterranean : in other words prosperity , for example , of fishermen , who are asking you for it at the moment ; in other words peace in the west , in the saharan provinces of morocco , and in the east , in palestine .
marwan barghouti , the instigator and writer of the prisoners ' document , has been held in israel since april 2002 .
but also they may face violations of their fundamental rights , even from within their communities .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( pt ) madam president , this new proposal for a directive which we are now debating , despite proclaiming the principle of equal treatment between workers with regard to working conditions , a maximum limit on working time and weekly rest periods , allows a series of derogations which , in practice , may jeopardise these very principles , all the more so as what we really need to do is combat and minimise the proliferation of temporary employment agencies in order to put an end to precarious work and stop workers ' rights from constantly being called into question .
in the future , climate change makes it likely that we will face more disasters .
this being so , far more can be done to encourage organ donations by investing in education programmes at national levels , than by diverting funds to pay for well - intentioned bureaucratic meddling .
how can we assist with the democratisation of turkey ?
over time , this will only create either a field of indifference or a field for a battle .
the development of the renewable energy directive has been a stimulating process of work between the institutions , in which the parliament has played its full role .

we must defend our businesses according to research and development criteria and social criteria , as well as defending our foreign interests , for european citizens and those outside the european union .
( applause )
article 9 of the protocol , which safeguards meps ' freedom of expression , refers to people who were members of this house when they used certain terms or committed acts identifiable with them .
i believe now we can better see how partnership will make us progress , namely in terms of concrete delivery .
in writing . - ( pt ) i voted in favour of the amendments to regulation ( ec ) no 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation at second reading .
otherwise all our great plans will be meaningless and the europeans alone will make enormous efforts for results that will remain a drop in the ocean .
the priority of our political work should be the people and human dignity , and we cannot ignore the fact that there are people in europe who are going hungry .
can they work quickly enough ?
manufacturers will not face an additional burden and will have sufficient time to adapt their production to the requirements at every stage , while farmers will be able to exchange their oldest tractors for new ones , whose engines will be less polluting .
madam president , what is this : a bridge over troubled waters ?
( the president cut off the speaker )

i shall be perfectly happy to get a reply from the commissioner in writing .

in addition to the american and canadian military , i must also applaud the rapid and efficient deployment of groups from slovakia and the international military order of malta .
at the same time , the commission will have to present an assessment of the results from this harmonisation process in good time , in order to ensure that this has not caused any distortion of the market .
i am particularly pleased that , although this is the last budget negotiated on the basis of the treaty of nice and although , on this basis , the european parliament has no formal decision - making authority on agricultural spending , we have succeeded in negotiating a budgetary item of eur 300 million to support dairy farmers .
the endless efforts of haitian and international aid workers to meet the current challenges on the ground are commendable , but it is clear that the sheer scale of the crisis requires even more assets and resources .
unscrupulous employers take advantage of illegal immigrants to fill poorly paid , unskilled jobs that no one else wants to take on .
we have , today , reached a crucial moment in the way we operate .
i agree with the rapporteur when he emphasises the need to educate customers on how to approach innovation in public contracts , since the profession is highly skilled and needs well - trained staff .
in particular , initiatives could be taken to register such incidents and raise awareness of this issue in european ports .
one reason for this has been the very good preliminary work of the commission in this case .
for this reason , this procedure must only be an absolute exception in future .

i look forward to responding to your comments .

such a reform would have to consider what our trading partners are doing rather than unilaterally giving up any legal mechanisms to protect ourselves from dumping : legal mechanisms , incidentally , which are based on an internationally agreed set of rules .

one question about the motion for a resolution before us : why are we even thinking about giving money to gaza ?
the shortages of imports impose an additional cost burden on the livestock and feedstuffs sectors , putting the economic viability of domestic meat production at risk .
mr president , i am not responsible for this report but i would like the colleagues who have been dealing with this issue to note that we are voting today on two reports , one on china and one on burma , dealing with a disaster and the different reactions to it .
that is an important aspect of what we do as well .
that is why i welcome the firm approach announced by the european commission , one which our parliament is able to demonstrate today .
thank you very much indeed for allowing us to make this point .
the negotiating mandate sets the objective of establishing an open aviation area between the european union and canada .
( applause )
massive population displacements and migrations affect the union as a whole and not just a part of it .
at the moment , the messages are necessary , but they are always difficult or restrictive .
this means that we have to take more than 6 million tonnes of sugar out of production .
the european union would undoubtedly welcome such a dialogue and is ready to contribute , to mediate and assist in any way possible .
in the commission proposal for a recast of the dublin regulation , this principle remains untouched .
we , europe , must now take control of and lead the switchover to a sustainable automotive sector , something that is only possible if we guide the sector through this severe and life - threatening recession .
mrs weber raised the question of inequality .
ever since , the country has sunk into unbelievable confusion .
however , in the employment strategy , we must focus equally on shaping the course of transformation towards a green economy , on carrying the workers with us and preparing them for the transition .

the opportunities to reduce emissions in passenger cars are much greater in terms of lightweighting and changing the fuel mix .
the proposed approach - a common approach as far as possible - to the structure and workings of the agencies concerned seeks to restrict bureaucratic rigidity so that they can play their regulatory role correctly and effectively and can be supervised and so that the current requirements for auditing and accountability can , at least partially , be satisfied .
so let us act accordingly .
at a time when fish stocks are in decline and when some people on this planet do not have enough to eat , it is shameful that we catch good fish , kill it and then throw it back into the sea to feed the gulls and the crabs .
given that the european community is a member of the united nations convention on the law of the sea of 1982 , the european commission has always undertaken to promote freedom of navigation in all its aspects and the development of appropriate instruments to prevent illegal acts against ships .
it is enshrined as such , and i do not think we should change it .
the cross - border healthcare issue has been under negotiation for a long time , and it caused an outcry when , in a previous draft , the risk emerged of creating two - speed healthcare specifically promoting medical tourism for better - off patients and harming those member states which could not have planned their healthcare provision on the basis of a demand that depended on the quality offered ...
we can agree on the fact that the current legislation in this area is not very effective .
let me also thank the different committee rapporteurs and the many other distinguished members of parliament who have been particularly involved , throughout the last two years , in building the parliament 's contribution to this emerging european policy .

however , we need to be able to fully implement external relations financial instruments .
we are going to vote electronically .
in the specific case of india , a cooperation agreement was signed by the commission and indian negotiators in new delhi on 7 september 2005 .
i have not yet identified any strategy within the policies of the member states or the policies of the commission which might lead us towards these objectives .
i see that time is running out , but i do hope we shall have more opportunities to discuss this or that issue more thoroughly .
but it also merits attention on account of the position of the religious groups i referred to earlier and of other minorities .
in other words , any woman could go directly to the european court of justice to enforce this right : the eu provides no stronger legal protection .
dates of forthcoming sittings : see minutes
in that way , the famous small offences like the stolen piglet would not be so much of a problem .
before we begin , i should like to say that i have exchanged views with president havel , and i can assure you that we could not have imagined something like this 25 years ago !
today , more than ever , we need to tone up and strengthen our economies by taking measures to speed up the adoption and use of clean technologies which will help to create clean jobs .
verification of credentials : see minutes
also , what lessons can the union give about freedom of religion when it embraces a country such as turkey , which has massacred or driven out all its former minority religions and openly discriminates against the few that remain ?
i should stress the important role played by the egf in reintegrating redundant workers into the labour market .
only sustainable growth can guarantee the creation of sustainable jobs .
therefore , there is no reason to object to the content of the agreement .
firstly , unlike mr schulz , i should like to say that the czech presidency under prime minister topolánek has so far been an excellent presidency .
i am therefore sure that we will achieve clarity in the matter tomorrow .
mrs ferrero - waldner , you know that i have great respect for you , and i know that you are taking action and working together with others to achieve much .
we , the commission , can put this in place , bilaterally with the government , but i believe efforts are necessary from all those that can contribute , namely in terms of technical assistance coming from different member states .
we have had negative experience reforming the common agricultural policy , and this is likely to repeat itself now .
where is the realisation that cancer is a global problem , which should be approached at a global level ?
safeguarding enhanced protection for geographical indications within the framework of bilateral trade agreements and the wto is of primary importance .

the more developed and wealthiest countries in particular have responsibilities that they cannot shirk .
when i went to the united kingdom i said that the entente cordiale between france and the united kingdom was not enough .

( on behalf of the ppe - de group ) . - ( sv ) mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner for his presentation , and i welcome the fact that he emphasises the importance of greater cooperation between the member states and the responsibility member states have for implementing the posting of workers directive correctly .
for that i congratulate them .
i have tried my best , and i will , of course , have the opportunity to return to your parliament in december , if you wish , to respond at greater length to the questions of everyone who takes the floor .
first of all , a partnership of equals .
is that really major , durable aid to pakistan ?
large areas , such as the middle east , asia and africa , are the scene for stiff imperialist competition and intervention to control wealth - producing resources and energy transportation routes , which is causing tremendous poverty , harsh exploitation and repression , in collaboration with the bourgeois classes at home and to the detriment of the people .
neighbouring countries which are interested in the construction of the pipeline are also saying so .
that is why , while favouring a compromise that defends the economy , we can never accept this being achieved at the cost of the fundamental progress made .
legislation is not always the answer ; each case must be examined and considered carefully and the competitiveness and sustainability of each sector must be closely watched .
we must not forget the rights of local languages .
for the last six years we have spent a lot of energy on institutional issues .
the agreements should be adopted through a fruitful interinstitutional agreement that enables the european institutions to participate actively in them .
why should it be different this time ?
i do not want to caricature it , but i must say it is a real problem .
it is my opinion that you have made a complete dog 's breakfast of it .
the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon provides the legal basis for starting negotiations regarding the eu 's accession to the echr .
that and reverse qualified majority voting are points on which adjustments are still being made , and there is no conclusion on them yet .
my final point concerns the first and the second pillar .
as a portuguese mep , and given that portugal is a country with a strong tradition of fishing and specific interests in the northwest atlantic fisheries organisation ( nafo ) , i welcome the amendments to the text of the convention , as it aims to provide better operating conditions for this regional fisheries organisation ( rfo ) .
there is a difference between aid and what is contained in this trade package .
i expect this will not be possible in the near or distant future .
i would also like to point out that these roaming tariffs have been very unclear .
i would like to express my solidarity with the japanese people following the earthquake and the tsunami that occurred in march in northeast japan .
that has been a real success for parliament .
the issues causing concern that must be covered include peace , the problem of displaced persons and the fight against serious diseases such as aids and malaria .
the third factor - the readiness of those whose task it is to introduce and apply european law - is the most underestimated .
there is , too , no doubt that this new initiative on domestic work is very important , because there is a very large number of people who do this type of work and because it also very much affects women and immigrants .
storm klaus caused devastation , in particular to the country 's infrastructure .
in addition , the changes in the visa policy should also appear as soon as possible on the european institutions ' websites .
( el ) mr president , i have listened most attentively to your message about the irish ' no ' vote .
as a young adult i witnessed what communism is capable of , and i remember the hope with which we waited for the voice of the free world , the western world .
none of the member countries of the zone , no matter what its export strategy , no matter what its deficit level , no matter what its public debt level , has a chance of emerging from the crisis if one of the links is attacked .
finally , the deadlines for cancellation .
serbia has received encouragement with the vote on the stabilisation and association agreement .
it is a good thing that parliament is paying closer attention to the implementation and transposal of the legislation we pass here .
i , like many of my voters , fail to understand how , when a country admits it is using disproportionate military action against a civilian population - it deliberately targets schools , it deliberately targets the buildings of peaceful and neutral international organisations - we still do not believe it has breached its human rights clauses .
i believe that the need to sign the convention is very clear , and i also believe that it needs to be done with the speed with which the commission has already begun to act .
hundreds of young people die every day for the simple reason that they do n't have access to this register .
it is our duty to explain to the european citizens the need for and the provisions of this treaty .
the commissioner stated that she is satisfied .
the inherit conflict of interests that arises when a company owns both transmission and generation of electricity has been addressed , and the regulatory regime governing the energy markets has been strengthened .
youth - particularly student - exchanges will help to promote the implementation of these tasks , along with the development of scientific , cultural and tourist cooperation .
as a result , there will be a reduction in the number of organs wasted due to the absence of a suitable recipient in a particular geographical area .
this report shows significant differences between member states in terms of waste management performance .
however , we can make things better today by supporting the amendment calling for a mandatory register of financial interests and real sanctions for those who break the rules .
my other question is this : what carrots and sticks are we to employ to enable the eu 2020 strategy to be more successful than the lisbon tragedy , since the member states could not care less about it ?
to close , i should like to wish the new commissioner every success in his job and , if i may , say the following : our honourable and experienced colleague , mr cercas , said earlier that he hopes that you will enter and proceed with the ' right ' foot .
i have heard again and again what a good thing it is .
of course we need to reduce debt , but we also need to ensure that this economic governance helps to guarantee the success of the europe 2020 strategy .
in my view , and that of my group , the british opt - out is shameful and should fade to oblivion as quickly as possible .
one of those reviewed state aid rules was connected with , for example , broadband .
having embarked on this road , the only fate that can await moldova , in the best case scenario , is that of belarus .
in order to prevent taxpayers suffering further harm , we must clear the decks .
i would prefer to have specific opt - outs for specific countries than to be forced to lower the overall level of ambition of our treaty and our europe .
that would honour the person that he is : committed to the peaceful transformation of china ; a literary critic , teacher and author , who has always sought to bring freedom of expression and democracy to china through the world of ideas and words .
this would solve the equation .
this shows that when the issue is adequately highlighted , progress can be achieved even when there are no binding targets .
that is the first problem , and the second is one of signals .
on the one hand , we must support developing countries , but this can be done only through transparent , closely monitored investments and , on the other , the revenues from the european union 's emission trade auctions should also be used to support developing country 's measures to promote adaptation .
workers must have the same criteria for accessing public social protection schemes , notably as regards contributions and privileges .
it could be the basis for the genuine new european tax policy that we need .
i am convinced that , by analogy to the example i referred to above , it is also important for children who are socially disadvantaged to be able to participate in an inclusive way alongside other children in all the various stages of education .
i am referring to mr schmitt .
this guide should enable an even greater proportion of complainants to address directly the body best equipped to deal with the complaint . complaints which are inadmissible for me will therefore be resolved more promptly and effectively .

by dealing with the risk factors associated with these diseases , we will , at the same time , be dealing with those associated with cardio - cerebrovascular conditions .
one of them is that member states are perfectly well able to enact statutory safeguards against racism , in other words eu action in this area is fundamentally at odds with the subsidiarity principle .
consumers who are well informed of their rights and obligations contribute to a more transparent and competitive market .
i come from the region of northern moravia , from silesia , an area where czech , polish and slovak territory all meet .

the increasing popularity of smart phones has created a new market in terms of technology , software and applications .
let us , however , come back to the matter in hand .

the green paper starts from the broadly shared view that not only market - based instruments , such as taxes , charges and tradable permit schemes , but also targeted subsidies , provide a flexible and cost - efficient means of reaching given policy objectives .
i believe that there is a chance that we could obtain significant reductions .
the ban on the export of weapons to uzbekistan would appear to be just such a case : not all member states are of the same view .
we are therefore linking the number of reports that plant operators have to send to the authorities to the risk posed by their plants and to whether the operators meet the requirements imposed on them .
we have spoken out against protectionism and established the internal market as one of europe 's important achievements , and one which also needs to be preserved at a time of crisis .
you can blame me as energy commissioner , and say ' you should have foreseen this ' .
it is up to the operators what kind of billing system they want to adopt .
a very great deal of economic damage has been wrought that would have been perfectly preventable if more care had been taken with communications in the crisis .
this report , which merited my vote in favour , warns of a series of situations worthy of particular attention .
( el ) mr president , there can be no doubt that the birth of emu and the euro are one of the highlights in the sixty - year history of european integration .

we must provide sufficient finance for the eu 2020 strategy to which we have all committed ourselves .
( parliament approved the request . )
the resolution tabled renews our commitment to the fight against a serious disease that still affects one in five people over the age of 85 .
- ( fr ) mr president , it is fine to have a strategic partnership to begin with , to have the volkswagen factory in puebla and to have joint parliamentary committees with chile and with mexico , but it has been 30 years , as mr salafranca sánchez - neyra said in his report , of being realistic , of cooperating , of setting a climate , a little discussion on agriculture , drugs , women , water and so on .
more than ever , therefore , europe needs an appealing , new , future - oriented project which will inspire people with enthusiasm once again .
i worked on the report concerning the draft decision on a joint framework for placing goods onto the market and i focused my amendment proposals on increasing the responsibility of importers , reducing the administrative burden on smes , retaining the new approach as the basic framework for placing products onto the market and creating and using european standards in a more flexible way .

mr hasnain has subsequently said that this was based on personal estimates and did not mention the year and did not carry out any formal research .

the commission is to send parliament a first draft of this in the autumn .
it raises the issue of physical education and the role of sport in schools .
the eu peace - keeping mission has unfortunately suffered its first fatality , after a french peace - keeper mistakenly strayed into sudanese territory .
the scenes of barbarism that took place in the 1990s between the hutus and the tutsis will always remain deeply embedded in our minds and will always seriously disturb our conscience .
similarly , attempts to implement safety - engineered medical devices only in certain areas or on certain patients would be neither practical nor effective .
i would like to highlight some aspects regarding the importance of infrastructure investments .
between 2002 and 2007 , the european commission assigned a total of eur 1 400 000 000 in aid to that country .
i voted for this report as this initiative supports the efforts being made by the republic of moldova , a state neighbouring the eu , to carry out reform and modernisation .
i have even heard talk of it being introduced solely in the euro area .
additionally , the council again mentioned the importance of further improvements in access to finance - i am thinking of loans , guarantees , mezzanine finance , etc - and also to venture capital for newly established innovative enterprises and for small and medium - sized enterprises where it is necessary to take account of the effects of the current financial crisis .

i also believe that the new president of the ecb will implement a culture of honesty and rigour , as well as helping to set out robust and consistent economic policy , sending a clear signal of confidence to the international markets .
the training of staff plays a very important role in this respect .
the second basic debate this year will be about economic security : are the united states and europe able together to do things about the crisis or will they try to do it on their own , which will mean a rapid development of protectionist measures ?
let us consider the ambition . in 2013 , electrical energy auctions will gradually take place and by 2015 , we want to see a global market in carbon at an oecd level .
madam president , preparing the budget for 2010 requires a lot of courage .
the first is the large - scale printing of new money in the usa and the european union in recent months .
all information should be available but this information should not be communicated in a way that means raising multiple alarms and triggering consumers ' fears when evidence has not yet been found .
we must do this not just so that we can be morally and politically correct academically , but also so that we can , in practice , prevent similar occurrences in the future .
this parliament firmly believes that intellectual property rights must be protected , but not by giving private companies sweeping rights to monitor indiscriminately every citizen 's activities on the internet - something that we refuse to allow even our police to do when fighting terrorism - and certainly not through the disproportionate penalty of cutting whole households off from the internet .
however , i cannot understand the scaremongering that has been associated with the phrase ' climate change ' .
if the commission reviews its doctrine , then so much the better .
naturally - and this is a comment that also refers to a large extent to the amendments which i have received , fortunately few in number - the report cannot deal with every subject .

the council will continue to monitor further progress in all areas since proper follow - up is an ongoing exercise in all schengen countries .

progress made in equal opportunities and non - discrimination in the eu ( debate )
the italian government should be given a clear message about it from the european parliament .
of course , many points in the report infringe the principle of subsidiarity of member states .
( fr ) madam president , commissioner , i recall a few years ago asking the then competition commissioner whether she was aware of any evaluation being carried out on the effectiveness for consumers of fines set , and on this matter , the then commissioner indicated at the beginning of our committee meeting that she had managed to claw back so many million euro in fines .
the commission is monitoring closely how the situation evolves and will continue to use every opportunity to call on the iranian authorities to observe their international human rights commitments , including compliance with the international covenant on civil and political rights and the universal declaration of human rights .
as highlighted in both reports , the revised neighbourhood policy will also recognise and act on the importance of the civil society .
in all of these places , both the inhabitants and nature paid dearly for the greed of the modern - day gold diggers , facilitated by the indifference of the authorities .
when it comes to russia , we often hear about the expansion of russian companies in the european market , especially in the energy sector , but , at the same time , european investors face enormous difficulties when they want to invest in russia , especially in sectors that russia deems as strategic , such as the energy sector .
we would like the eu 's priorities for the budget to be focused more on the future , increased competitiveness , investments in infrastructure and research , rather than propping up agricultural policy .
1 .
many of the amendments from the committee on employment and social affairs have been taken into account by the six - pack rapporteurs .
the commission appreciates that parliament strongly underlines the joint responsibility of the eu institutions and the member states in this respect .
the range of solutions applied by the member states to the problem of the mutual recognition of authentic acts has meant that , today , the movement of these documents is a complicated matter , and there are restrictions in terms of the number and the types of documents that may be transmitted .
( pl ) mr president , the work currently being carried out on the review of the small business act should concentrate , in particular , on establishing a european private company statute , thus facilitating the cross - border operations of economic entities in the eu market .
the presence of immigrants with different cultural customs and traditions is a source of tension in many member states .
ever since the treaty of lisbon was implemented , parliament has acted with the council in codecision on budgetary matters : by not getting any precise commitment to date on the role that we , as meps , will have in preparing the next financial framework and on providing the necessary reflection on new own resources , we run the risk of allowing the council to become lord and master over the future of the european project .
i would like to thank mrs hassi who , with the other rapporteurs , has managed to provide a synthesis , to prevent the whole thing from becoming an overdressed christmas tree .
both meps and their assistants must be rooted in the realities of their own country .
it groups together all the relevant rules into one single legislative act , which will therefore improve legal consistency .
this obliges employees to work 65 to 77 hours a week .
however , permanent public discussion about the number of women in business , the continuing major difference in salary levels and the numerous disadvantages suffered by women in the workplace show clearly that we still have a long way to go until the sexes are equal .
( cs ) madam president , i would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for an excellent piece of work .
concerning drilling operations , i would like to insert ' by eu and third countries ' .
i believe that we must look into the matter of where exactly the community can act as a community and make legal proposals to improve the situation .
at the same time , however , measures should be taken to protect community production and consumers .
we are trying to link together trade and development , by which i mean trade policy and development policy .
mind you , ' swift ' and ' community patent ' are not words and concepts that go comfortably together .
this method is perfect .
i believe that , as the european parliament , we should work to change and adapt community and national legislation , so that unaccompanied minors reach the country which is their final destination , are not deported , and are ensured a dignified and safe stay in the european union .
otherwise , jobs and a beautiful and unique species will be lost forever .
if this continues to develop as envisaged , europe will be able to congratulate itself , by the end of the year , on a major success , as it has established the pattern for the chinese authorities .
finally , i would like to stress how vital it is to establish democracy and respect human rights .

secondly , if the regulatory framework has been unclear so far , we must explore retrospectively and in depth everything that has happened .
add to this the major pandemics such as aids , malaria , tuberculosis , and so on , and this set of factors means that we find ourselves facing a genuine disaster .
we need political and moral will to proceed .
we have more sub - markets and regional borders , and we must do everything we can to ensure that in the next five years the single market can also be implemented for industry and consumers with the goal of greater competition and transparency .
why should we ban thrombin ?
patents are currently far too expensive ; we absolutely must reduce the costs associated with creating them .
the problem is , of course , partly population growth : in my lifetime the world 's population has gone up from two and a half billion to six and a half billion .
member states themselves have agreed that they will adopt fiscal planning horizons of at least three years to include all levels of government and government funds in their budget processes and ensure that information on , for example , contingent liabilities is disclosed .
thank you for your attention .
with your agreement , i shall resolutely defend these principles before the european council in brussels on 19 and 20 june .
achieving a minimum 25 % reduction in the eu poverty level by 2020 is closely linked to increasing the employment rate to 75 % .
the demand in the report for increased simplicity in the administration and implementation of the funds is to be welcomed and supported .
how can it be claimed that there are no databases when we have published a database called roms on a french website on the internet today , with the cities of origin and a variety of information about roma people , including those from the eu : from bucharest , belgrade and timişoara ?
concerning the freedom of religion , turkey must provide both the legislative and the practical conditions for it to be exercised .
a conflict of interests is apparent here .
in july , the sri lankan government was holding more than 280 000 people in 30 camps guarded by the army in the north - east of the island .
in writing . - ( pl ) i have supported mrs gurmai 's report describing the situation of women in the balkans , because it raises vital issues which , regrettably , do not concern that region alone , and are not isolated cases .
mr president , we are in favour of the enlargement of the european union to include all the balkan countries , if they so wish .
yes , we need a much more integrated approach to the economic , social and environmental strands of the different strategies .
i agree with the report by the confederal group of the european united left - nordic green left .
we are reversing 300 years of democratic development .
if we only investigate individual risks , we will never have a realistic scenario .
so a failed restructuring would result in great damage for the company and for its workers , in negative spillovers for the whole sector , and in a waste of taxpayer 's money .
is there anything better to do in this time of crisis ?
opening of the sitting
however , it is definitely in our common interest to have well - organised transport and a well - operating rail transport structure as a meaningful alternative , in particular , to road transport , which undoubtedly places a very significant burden on our environment .
all the european institutions that depend on the european union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the court of auditors and by all entities with that function .
tomorrow , we will - hopefully together - lay the foundation for a new european legal framework , which will ensure a genuine opening of the market and greater transparency and competition with regard to procurement .
establishing a european platform for urban mobility would certainly do that .
this will mislead the consumer .
i consider this to be a very , very important matter .
the eu also exacerbates the problem of people trafficking .
the thracian question is also just as important as relations between turkey and the other neighbouring countries .
it is inevitable that the following priorities for the budget guidelines 2011 have to be taken into account : the implementation of fp 7 , which will have reached its maturity in 2011 , should be closely monitored ; the development of the newly established european space policy and the promotion of scientific and technological advance , supporting innovative technologies and sustainable development ; the challenges relating to sustainable energy and the fight against climate change must be reflected in the eu budget priorities ; these priorities will require additional budgetary resources , particularly for funding the iter and the european strategic energy technology plan and promoting energy efficiency ; the importance of the galileo project , of the gmes programme and of the european institute of innovation and technology ; the proper implementation and evaluation of ongoing pilot projects and preparatory actions should be the priority .
the final adopted document , which is the result of a compromise , is not an ideal text , but this document contains no defamation of an anti - semitic character , no defamation of any specific country or region in the world , or of any religion .
i say respectfully to all of those who believe that we do not need a blueprint to fight our corner for the area of freedom and security and justice that we want : we do not take our players off the field when the game begins .
but i think the commissioner got the balance right , probably better than most of us , in terms of where we are going and what needs to be done in the future .
the union must view the world cotton market as a whole and give eu consumers the opportunity to buy cotton as cheaply as possible without the consideration of where it has been produced , provided it has been produced under certain ethical and environmentally sound conditions .
president - in - office of the council . - ( cs ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you for an excellent discussion .
social groups are sometimes disregarded or suffer discrimination for reasons of gender , sexual orientation , ethnicity , religion and so on .
on the other hand , there is no evidence that fruitful tax competition would erode tax bases .
i think , however , that we should elaborate and clarify the formula for these meetings .
the insertion of one word : ' sincere cooperation ' .

furthermore , parliament wants the transfer of data to comply with european data protection standards .
nobel prize winner maurice allais has always been openly critical of innovative finance , securitisation , derivatives and hedge funds , much beloved of the finance gnomes in a certain part of europe 's financial sector .
the alternative to the negotiations being delayed or failing is an amplification of moscow 's bilateral talks with rome or vilnius , berlin or budapest , paris or sofia .
no changes .
therefore , i hope that the result of today 's vote on the strategic report 2010 will send that message to the member states and the commission .
thank you very much to everyone .
however , it is in the public interest that risks should be restricted to prevent systemic crisis .
i would remind you that the estimated annual amount of tax fraud is eur 200-250 billion , or two per cent of gdp .
finally , i would like to underline that airport security is a much larger question than the introduction of a new screening technology .
this vote by our parliament , which follows several resolutions since the jasmine revolution in tunisia , is proof that the events in the arab world are a wave , the size and longevity of which no one can predict .
mr president , commissioner , this is in fact the first major free trade agreement that europe has passed for some years , and when it comes to free trade agreements , it must be said that you do not lack ambition - south korea , canada , india , mercosur .
in recent years , we have seen non - humanitarian bodies increasingly involved in the response to humanitarian crises .
the president of the commission will be elected by the european parliament .
of course , nobody writes a blank cheque or makes commitments in advance , and what we do should not replace what is going on in a positive sense in some centres or in partnerships , but the eit should create still further momentum , incentives and scope for a more innovation - friendly europe union .
more importantly , i would remind the house that , in 2009 , the land border between greece and albania and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia accounted for the largest percentage , namely 34 % , of illegal immigrants apprehended throughout the european union .
we wish to support the member states so that they can contribute more effectively to promoting innovation and protecting consumer health and safety , and we need to take a global approach .
that is the real content and meaning of the ' eu 's role in the world ' that has been announced : in other words , its ambition to share control of areas of influence , markets and natural resources with the us and japan .
they also relate to the role of eurocontrol , which we believe needs to be completely overhauled in order to ensure its good governance and control over the provision of services .
for that reason , we need to make efforts towards more dialogue , more tolerance and confidence - building in the region .
mental illnesses , a flood of suicides and depression have become a threat to contemporary society .
and this really raises the big question .
however , substances are used on our planet which are thousands of times more toxic than cyanides .
very briefly , on culture , because it was raised as an important element , we are fully aware - and i also see it during my travels - that both regions and cities are major actors in the cultural field in europe .
from the perspective of the cost - benefit factor , this form of company could , in future , be more important than the european company .
is it possible that , one day , this parliament might respect the right of defence of one of its members , and not just in guatemala or indonesia , but inside this chamber ?
indeed , the time has come to shape a new overall approach to eu agencies , improving their overall coherence , effectiveness , accountability and transparency .
i have only three comments , since much has been said here already in the debate .
to what extent does this process mean that both we and our partners will enjoy more democracy , more human rights and a more equitable distribution of wealth ?
the latest eu - wide data shows that only 67 % of schools have broadband access and that there were large disparities between member states and between densely and thinly populated areas , 73.7 % and 60.6 % respectively .
the maroni line is approved by malta , greece and cyprus , and by those who live near the southern frontier of our country .
yesterday evening , the debate was very spirited , mr president , and our fellow members voiced a lot of criticism .
one indication of this is the shooting down of an unmanned drone by a russian aircraft , as there is no doubt whatsoever that this was not done by an abkhazian air force plane .
that is one of my concerns .
the agreement reached on 15 december 2009 between the eu , a group of latin american countries and the united states regarding customs duties on banana imports appears to have advantages , but does not fully reconcile the legitimate interests of all the parties .
it is therefore now even more important for member states to promote the birth rate and to pay proper attention to families .
president of the commission . - some of those matters fall within national spheres of responsibility , but in the areas that fall within our sphere of responsibility , we have recently proposed some improvements .
there must be no disadvantaging of the member state carrying out the treatment due to a lack of clarity about whether the patient or the sending state is to pick up the tab .
the uniform definitions proposed in this report , which among other things harmonise the withdrawal right and rules relating to unfair contract terms in contracts , will create legal certainty and thus increase the appeal of cross - border trade for companies , which will ultimately benefit consumers .
let us take the controversy over the regulation of co 2 emissions from cars as just one example .
if everyone introduces a new subject , it will not benefit research funding in the long run .
i am convinced that the european union has to take all these factors into consideration in the future .
there should also be considerable flexibility as regards foreign policy , taking into consideration the political complexity in ukraine .
mr president , colleagues will have received an e-mail from me on monday describing my experiences during an informal visit to cairo last weekend .
we are aware of your revolutionary enthusiasm , mr pannella .
all this is your immense exertion !
according to the target set in 2002 , eu member states must offer early years education to 90 % of children between the age of three and the compulsory school age .
if we are talking about investing in research and there is no uptake of the research because we will not make the right political decisions , we are wasting our time .
author . - madam president , somalia has been the subject of european parliament and un resolutions in the past .
many parts of the world are already struggling to cope with the negative impacts of the rising global average temperature , and this trend will continue in the coming years .
i am very grateful to the council , too .
firstly , human beings are not the most important part of the ' environment ' and humans do not own the water , the soil and the earth .
this is our intention .
he and his kind should be executed .
however , although the globalisation of the economy should be seized as an opportunity , our fellow citizens are often very concerned about the economy of our continent , as others are about theirs .
that is certainly the case .
russia must stop using situations of this kind in a way which is not in keeping with international procedures and refrain from creating new spheres of influence .
this action plan represents , on its own , a comprehensive work programme for the commission in the area of freedom , security and justice .
a shortage of applicants for certain jobs means that illegal immigrants are being employed , as the cost of their labour is significantly lower .
the assembly does not focus exclusively on a rigid plan of action .
the people are not being told about the way military matters are being fiddled about with ; instead , the union is marketed as a peace project for civilians , which it no longer is .
however , i must express some doubt about the effects which any kind of measures directed against tobacco growers would have .
the idea of a multilateral agreement to combat piracy and counterfeiting may be an effective mechanism for curbing such activities .
the situation regarding fundamental rights within the european union is becoming increasingly critical rather than improving .
from the point of view of the eu , there should be a closer focus on human rights .
the greek government is working with its action plan .
in these conditions , the commission feels that there is no current need to play a bigger role in producing research into national legislation nor into wider issues such as addictions , fraud or other reprehensible activities .
although it will indeed not be possible to state ' this is not a toy ' on products that look like toys , producers will unfortunately label their toys as ' decorations ' .
therefore , in actual fact , i should first and foremost like to urge the rapporteur to remember that this food information is intended primarily to be a tool for the consumer and not a marketing tool for enterprises .
it is envisaged that every household within the eu should have a broadband internet connection at a competitive price by 2013 .
in fact , another eu - latin america meeting is scheduled for next may in madrid .
ladies and gentlemen , in the last 18 months , we have made enormous progress towards putting in place a financial system that is more ethical , robust and responsible .
i fully understand those who are fighting to retain their old privileges , but this is simply not the agenda that we politicians must pursue .
those who appreciate good football will definitely have a great time .
i hope that this resolution will be taken seriously - even if we adopt it after the summit - particularly in view of the large protests and people 's concerns about the effects of the imf reform , and that we follow what is happening now in kiev and ukraine in general very closely .
the president of parliament should officially submit the text of the draft decision agreed by parliament in the vote to the commission and council to examine , pursuant to article 195 of the ec treaty .
this programme deserves the european commission 's full attention to ensure its continuation and expansion .
they are an important part of the political space at eu level and of the european democracy , of which the european citizens ' initiative is an essential part .
given what the treaties of the union say and the content of the reform treaty on the issue of security and defence , and given what the president of the french republic said here yesterday and the fact that france will be taking on the presidency next year , could the council tell the house if it envisages that there will be a common defence policy within the european union in the lifetime of this parliament , or in the next parliament , and when it thinks that might come about ?
the european institutions and the turkish authorities should learn from this wisdom at long last .
europe absolutely has to help us protect these human lives which are ended every year .
in times of crisis , there is no point merely writing figures in the budget , but instead we should build a useful budget , immediately ready for action .
it must be made clear and i believe it really is important .
that is where there is much more confidence among citizens .
however , so that europe remains competitive in respect of other global players , the funding of research projects must be massively expanded , especially in the field of the new energy sources .
i agreed with the resolution , because the ccm is the first step in the right direction of prohibiting these deadly weapons for good .
the community of european shipyards ' associations ( cesa ) reckons that global demand in the shipbuilding industry will fall by 2014 as a result of the global financial crisis , while , in future , the shipbuilding industry will relocate to areas with lower costs , especially to regions in asia .
i am therefore in favour of a debate on own resources , of respect for the treaty of lisbon and of an ambitious and realistic europe .
i too would like to avoid an identity crisis .
in 2007 the european commission initiated a reflection on this issue with a view to identifying the existing provisions and examining the feasibility and value added of action at eu level , and a working group was set up for this purpose .
second , the additional costs for businesses in member states where the latter partly finance maternity leave ( for example , germany ) would be very high .
some time has passed since the adoption of the european parliament 's opinion on the eurovignette iii directive at first reading .
it is obvious that the response in europe was unsatisfactory from the point of view of the citizens .
we also welcome the renewed commitment to sustainable public finances and a rapid return to medium - term budgetary targets .
development funds should be used for development ; for education , health , agriculture , local communities and women 's organisations .
what i would warn against , however , is the labour force of economic migrants that we will get if we do not allow families , partners and children to accompany them .
( the sitting was closed at 11 p.m. )
finally , i would like to congratulate both authors on a superbly prepared document .
the report by mrs rovana plumb , on behalf of the committee on women 's rights and gender equality , on the face of female poverty in the european union .
however , that must not be an excuse for any lack of immediate action .
whole regions have been flooded , regions that are bigger than many of our member states .
in writing . - without any doubt , since the accession negotiations started , croatia has made decisive efforts to comply with the requirements of the acquis communautaire .
it is argued that this network will help control illegal immigration , but what happens if a country like romania , for example , basically gives citizenship to hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants ?
many of the provisions of this constitution are very partisan , such as the omission of protection of gay people from discrimination and the giving of extra votes to mothers .
we therefore have no other choice in the matter .
on 15 september , i condemned the risky situation and the helplessness and defencelessness of these workers .
active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market (
looking at the speed at which we have improved the green part of the budget , you can see that things are moving too slowly .
this report demonstrates what european propaganda can produce when it wants to overlook the mistakes of the past ; it is true that mr chountis 's report highlights the problems within albania , but at the same time it almost seems to be saying that we are obliged to accommodate the balkan countries in the union , as if it were written in the stars and no one could oppose it .
it is a fundamental freedom which is enshrined in article 16 of the treaty , and to which the presidency attaches particular importance .
i repeat . mr tőkés got 334 votes .
social services have virtually collapsed .
there is an authority that is involved in planning , is permanent in nature , has the necessary expertise and can take independent decisions to improve the accommodation of ships .
these three reports were drawn up following the proposal for a single market act published by the european commission .
therefore , i particularly agree with the rapporteur 's opinion on the proposals at this directive 's second reading .
it is essential to find a political solution to this crisis .
the provisions do not cover rural areas , which means that many people from marginalised social groups living in the countries of central and eastern europe will not benefit from the proposed solutions .
what directives provide for are a number of procedural standards , rather than for a standard procedure .
the signing of an expanded agreement with the united states on data protection is essential and urgently needed ; it will prevent these issues from being dealt with by the member states on the basis of individual bilateral agreements .
it is a difficult path , but one which is not impossible .
the commission proposal lays down specific requirements to ensure member states will establish a national regulatory and organisational framework , and draw up appropriate national programmes for managing spent fuel and radioactive waste , from generation up to disposal .
at the same time , the programme includes many other initiatives for 2010 and beyond .
it is unacceptable that the commission should grant itself 12 months to deal with these simple cases , which , apart from the necessity of a quick reaction , do not require any analysis or assessment .
that is why i voted as i did .
the global phase - out of single - hull oil tankers and the backlog of old vessels now being withdrawn from the market , many of which contain hazardous substances , allow us to predict an uncontrolled expansion in sub - standard facilities in south asia , which may even spread to african countries .
this inertia can be seen in the events in italy , in brioni , where asbestos has not been removed , in porto marghera and in cengio , where deaths are still occurring .
the roma are still discriminated against and do not have adequate representation in croatian central and local political authorities .
instead , the commission should aim for greater efficiency and increase the number of its employees .
there is no time limit .
there is therefore a need to exploit the potential of the digital age , to create an eu - wide momentum , and to stimulate the cultural sector , in order to equip these industries with innovative economic models .
frankly speaking , it is a step which certainly is overdue .
the european union , particularly under the guidance of mr kovács , who i would like to congratulate , has been involved in a series of initiatives .
perhaps these presidential elections will help bring the country out of political stalemate and will provide more stability .
as a true friend of slovakia , a long - term supporter of its development and a modest but active participant in slovak reforms , i would be delighted to assist my slovak friends in overcoming this disadvantage and , at the same time , in contributing towards slovak being spoken and understood by an ever wider circle of people .
moreover , while i agree with the principle of maximum transparency , i believe that the funds to be allocated to the various sectors should be shared out without any discrimination in terms of efficiency or results .
for this reason , it was primarily a matter of applying to the staff regulations the organisational aspects of what had been agreed between parliament and the council in connection with the establishment of the european external action service in the particular areas of competence covered by these staff regulations .
it must be clear that illegal competition is not going to provide any advantages or benefits for those who do it .
a large proportion of imported food is produced in conditions where these standards are not complied with .
therefore , we must take care that the situation with regard to water does not grow any worse .
i therefore feel reasonably positive , at least towards the rapporteur .
on 28 november 2006 , the ukrainian parliament described the holodomor as a genocide .
madam president , even at this late time of the day , listening to the debate , i feel the need to say just three things .
what would you have said then , more than 20 years ago , if the eu had declared , ' yes , we are sending election observers there because the regime currently in office says that is alright ' ?
however , i have also read that next week we will see a new government supposedly including opposition representatives , according to the british foreign secretary .
the schengen agreement is already opening all the doors to europe to organised crime and illegal immigration .
in fact , we are a union of 27 democratic states and we have agreed that in common foreign and security policies , decisions should be taken unanimously .
we are not there yet .
a fall in production and consumption has been accompanied by a rise in imports and production costs .
rapporteur . - mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner also .
mr president , it is time to put back the real economy at the heart of the european agenda and to restore citizens ' confidence in our common market .
mr president , mr diamandouros , commissioner , this is a joint debate we are holding here .
( pl ) mr president , the threat to the world 's environmental balance requires us to take steps that will result in changes to our models of growth and a new lifestyle in our societies .
firstly , we must reduce the isolation of the burmese people .
not the council , not the commission , not the central bank , not even , ladies and gentlemen , our parliament , or any of the member states ' governments .
( fr ) ladies and gentlemen , i am satisfied .
i can understand that there are budgetary concerns , rightly so , about the rules .
i voted for discharge in respect of the implementation of the court of justice ( ecj ) budget for the financial year 2006 , based on the report by mr lundgren recommending that parliament should grant discharge to the court of justice 's registrar .
in writing . - ( fr ) amendments 23 and 24 to the cercas report , concerning sunday working , were deemed unacceptable on the grounds of compliance with the principle of subsidiarity .
as we all know and accept , children are the most valuable thing we have and , as you quite rightly said , commissioner , they are the most vulnerable members of society .
do we want a shot across the bows ?
provision of aid for lebanon must be accompanied by real progress on the objectives mentioned , and this must be set out in a grant agreement drawn up jointly with the lebanese authorities .
thus , the community institutions are in agreement .
we reject that view .
can you imagine specific sanctions ?
however , the cohesion policy must make investments effective , especially through strategic fund programming , thematic concentration of targets and simplification of implementation rules .
our families need support in many ways , and poor families are in particular need of help .
i must commend him on this ; it is an excellent document .
we urgently need to move from words to deeds .
( pl ) mr president , the report by mr guardans cambó deals with all the areas involved in strengthening partnership to allow european exporters easier access to third country markets .
for instance , france , germany and the netherlands have been much more active than belgium , which only took part in three operations .
our role as a parliament is accountability towards the citizens , so we have to make sure that taxpayers ' money is used properly , transparently and effectively .
however , i must point out that this resolution has also become a soup , to which a skilled cook has attempted to add - or rather , has added - very different ingredients .
1 .
only if this goal is reached will the sacrifice of so many innocent victims not have been in vain .
within hours of the publication of the council statement , the permission my delegation had for going to gaza was rescinded .
but , ironically , i have great faith in humanity , realising the reality of where we are at and adjusting to a more balanced look at what is needed for a vibrant society and again placing a greater value on children .
the commission has carefully examined the concerns expressed by various sides that the proposal would expel european research from europe , due to the supposed administrative burden or the cost involved in specific animal welfare requirements .
the objective is not to make decisions but to facilitate dialogue to ensure the sepa project is properly implemented .
the internal market can be revitalised by encouraging cross - border transactions and i believe that this report will help achieve this objective .
there are currently gaps in the implementation of eu energy legislation .
mobilisation of the european globalisation adjustment fund : h. cegielski - poznań from poland (
they have made a lot of progress but still , in order to be credible , the commission has to watch over all the benchmarks and all the conditions if we want to have credibility and legitimacy for this process .
- ( nl ) mr president , going through the moreno sánchez report automatically brings to mind the dutch saying ' zachte heelmeesters maken stinkende wonden ' , which means that desperate times require drastic measures .
civil society , both in china and internationally , has expressed considerable disquiet about the methods employed .
people in europe , too , will feel the threatening effects of climate change on their environment , economy and everyday life .
that concludes the debate on this item .
they ensure a more efficient and effective way of disbursing eu taxpayers ' money and enable parliament , particularly post - lisbon , to scrutinise spending and strategic policy in a more open and transparent manner .
this means that sadly , i cannot support it .
in the end , it is a credit to the ivorian people , to the work of the united nations with the support of the international community and , in particular i must say , to the european union and the facilitator , president blaise compaore of burkina faso , that these elections could finally take place .
in the european parliament , we must stand up for fair competition .
this is the conclusion of the report adopted by the european parliament on space and the security of the eu .
those who lose out will be small producers , who can no longer cover their production costs owing to such low prices .
recently some pictures have been published about where it is produced .
this law requires monitoring at a national level . let me add that at a 4 % rate , inspection would be more expensive than moving the european parliament from brussels to strasbourg .
the survey findings also show that we cannot relax our efforts ; we cannot overlook what is no longer a ' new ' disease .
be that as it may , the implications remain the same as three years ago .
we would be making a big mistake if , with our economic measures , we were to pursue goals relating to climate protection and energy security as unambitious as those we have laid down in the regulation of co 2 for cars .
on the one hand there was the exceptional nature and unusual importance of the legal instruments upon which we were working .
in writing . - ( sv ) all eu institutions are already bound by international law guaranteeing protection of human rights .
europe is pretending not to notice this , as economic interests are , of course , of the utmost importance .
( explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 )
all this has led , in an exceptionally short time , to the shaping of a harmonised and , in my opinion , excellent final text of all three debated documents .
the proposed eit will duplicate and conflict with existing eu programmes , like the framework programme for research , the competitiveness and innovation programme and the lifelong learning programme .
the debate is closed .
it is not always appreciated sufficiently , as fundamental rights are implemented more successfully among the elite than among ordinary people .
we need to encourage member states to invest more in developing their teaching staff .
he said ' globalisation ' 87 times and ' challenges ' 82 times , so it must be true .
this report address some of these issues , but it then limits itself to seeking to levy a new tax on heavy goods vehicles , to be added to the existing ones , some of which have been increased recently in portugal , such as the ' shadow tolls ' .
on the other hand , this parliament is straying off course in considering immigration as an instrument with which to secure the demographic and economic future of europe .
30 % would therefore still not be enough , we know that , and that is why we must actually offer this target , as it will drive up the ambition of other countries .
i wonder where the rapporteur got this less environmentally favourable proposal from , if it is not influenced by the motor industry lobby .
i think we have already started and we have to continue on this track so i am looking forward to our debate .
the vote will take place on wednesday 6 may 2009 .
unfortunately , no other mutually agreed solution was found .
( de ) mr president , i should like to make a request further to yesterday 's debate with the french presidency .
( de ) my question relates to the telecommunications package presented by the commission , where new opportunities for television arise as a result of the digital dividends , i.e. through the use of the digital spectrum of frequency allocation .
this will enable us to ensure that this assistance is provided in good time .
i am pleased that access to indian federal government contracts is being covered by these negotiations , but what about provincial contracts ?
the european union must not play the part of a supranational fruit police .
the distortions in the dairy farming market mean that each supply chain cannot function effectively or fairly .
redundancies are becoming increasingly common .
all our future diplomatic efforts must take this particular role of egypt into consideration .
it is high - profile work in those countries , and almost without exception it is money well spent .
you know full well that siemens , which is a large and historic company , has obtained contracts worth several million euros from co - funded programmes .
if your diary allows , and i hope that this will be possible , we will meet in ramallah .
we need answers to this too .
a number of member states , including romania , have had a low uptake of european funds to date .
consequently when these governments meet together as legislators , these affairs are , shall we say , confidential ; citizens must then await the final outcome .
analysts conclude that the priority of the current russian élites is to keep the present system in place , trying not to allow external relations to have any impact on the domestic situation .
i will just give you one example from here .
in the mean time , our services are organising a meeting with the key stakeholders for mid - april .
i await your debate with a great deal of interest .
since april systematic and detailed checks on buses and private cars with czech registration plates have been carried out in germany and austria .
this is why we need a simpler , clearer legislative framework to facilitate matters on both sides .
i think it is good that we are taking a decision on the agreement on pnr data , in order to develop a basic model for all future agreements of this sort and to recommend a negotiating framework to the commission , so that it takes into account our own ideas on data protection .
neurodegenerative diseases are one of the leading causes of disability among elderly people , and the problem is becoming worse as a result of the increase in the average lifespan .
those not covered could indeed end up working 86 hours per week , every week of the year .
( it ) mr president , quality , labelling and traceability : these are the consumer protection tools that guarantee product excellence .
it is also very important to combat poverty and social exclusion , particularly as regards elderly people , who have suffered most during the recession .
a servant of the god dionysus stole wine to give it to humans for the first time .
for example , we must eat less meat and we must travel less by car and aeroplane .
these actors are crucial to making the new system more effective than the current one .
are we talking about a two - year time - frame or a three - year time - frame ?
author . - ( pt ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there is a poem by ruy cinatti which i have committed to memory and which reads : ' perhaps we will be defeated or embattled , but only united ' .
beyond this comment , the report makes an attempt to open up certain avenues .
( el ) madam president , the european union defends human rights in the world , in keeping with its principles and values .
we are over - regulating ourselves out of the marketplace .
the lechner report and the opinions of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs and the committee on finance set out the basic parameters for preparing a balanced proposal for a council decision on the issue .
businesses could , in fact , use self - employed workers more , as they are able to offer their services on a more flexible basis and at a lower cost .
how should we treat such leaders ?
we do not know yet if the current level of energy and food prices is the one upon which the entire price structure will rely ; we also do not know what public policy actions the member states will take to facilitate the adjustment of the population 's businesses and savings and households to the new price structure .
the three of us from the political parties went out to the hospitals to find out for ourselves , and i think that was what was so important .
as regards the last communication to which you referred , it mentions earthquakes in passing at three points , to which you referred .
in this , it is crucial that the voice of railway workers is clearly heard and heeded in making rail travel safe for both workers and passengers .
i believe that the aforementioned indicators will take on a strategic importance in the definition of future cohesion policy , thereby contributing to smart , sustainable and inclusive growth , in line with the principles enshrined in the europe 2020 strategy .
perhaps the commissioner can give us more information about these .
1 .

i would add that the development cooperation instrument provides tools to protect the community 's financial interests , particularly as regards fraud and irregularities , as mr ryan hopes .
i personally support the use at this time of the word ' sufficient ' , especially when many of the funds in those areas have not been spent .
therefore , in our work on this proposal , we felt it was vital to ensure that consumers receive clear information on the fibres and textiles that they purchase . we therefore also wanted it to contain a 100 % fibre composition list .
this is not compatible with the spirit and letter of european and international declarations of human rights .
educating the children of migrants ( short presentation )
that is why i am strongly in favour of this report .
i would have even preferred slightly more , but at least this is a proposal that seems to me to be more balanced than the one initially put forward by the commission .
weak points have been seen in the hungarian constitution not only by the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs , but also by the committee on constitutional affairs .
second revision of the acp - eu partnership agreement ( cotonou agreement ) ( debate )
the circumvention of international law and its rules is highly dangerous .
some of the recommendations adopted in the committee on culture and education do not really create something new , like an information website on eu culture programmes and external relations , together with the calendar of eu events in the whole world plus contacts with civil society .
the commission acknowledges that , in this case , the time taken was unusually long , but i have given the reasons .
the position of farmers in the food supply chain can only be strengthened by cooperation and the inclusion of shared responsibility .
i agree , and i for one insist on being more representative of the citizens .
article 83(2 ) of the treaty of lisbon allows us to intervene in the rules of the individual member states and to check whether the legal provisions are being harmonised accordingly .
lapsed written declarations : see minutes
therefore , it is crucial , here , to fight the stereotypes and take action intended to promote equality of the sexes in public life and in politics .
i would mention two examples : the media have reported that 51 portuguese construction workers from the area of marco de canavezes have today gone to protest at a company in galicia , spain , which has not paid them two months ' wages and holiday pay .
however , we are still friends , which shows that europe has a future .
( applause )
in fact , by refusing to legislate and also by ignoring the different resolutions adopted by parliament and opting instead to attempt to regulate this sector by way of recommendations and administrative decisions the internal market and services directorate - general has created a climate of legal uncertainty .
it is only through discussing the challenges that lie between us in a spirit of mutual respect that we can hope to overcome them .
today , the european parliament is sending out a strong signal to the g 20 but , in particular , to the european heads of state or government .
the fact that national claims to the arctic are not always clear is a complicating factor .
this is both a clear demand by consumers and a requirement that must be respected in order to develop the internal market .
now , social engineering is generating an unusual paradox in the union .
in the procedure for approval of flavourings , ' reasonable technological need ' , for example , tackles other european strategies , such as the fight against obesity , since the addition of excessively potent flavourings can mask the poor quality of prepared food .
because its pensioners , having received their pension and enjoying this benefit , lived for an average of six months , and that was the record , that is to say it was the state held up as the best ...
in particular , it is necessary for their special units to be familiar with and cooperate with one other .
people have also talked about the need for greater diversity .

what about many of those people we are having meetings with today from rebel movements in north africa ?
that is the only way out and yesterday , during the church service , we heard a palestinian and a jewish representative call for the same thing , peace for their peoples .

it is good that we are increasing payments in instalments and speeding up expenditure on large projects submitted in advance , and that it will be possible for payments to be made prior to confirmation .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur for having produced an excellent piece of work and for having collaborated so well on what is a particularly sensitive issue .
implementation of the treaty of lisbon means that certain regulations need to be updated , including these ones , even though there is a dispute between the european commission and parliament 's proposals as far as the legal basis is concerned .

the third and final point is our need to fight for equal pay for men and women .
when you think that in 2006 we had practically as many arrest warrants as there were procedures over a 10 - year period , it is clear that the european arrest warrant has been a success .

in writing . - ukip meps abstained because we do not believe that the european union should be responsible for sending taxpayers ' money to the victims of the italian earthquake .
this closed attitude is unworthy of this house .
my wish for you , for us and , above all , for the citizens of the russian federation , is that the eu will more often present the position outlined today by mrs malmström rather than the one you presented .
( nl ) madam president , decisions were taken at the most recent european council that were still unthinkable a year ago and i would therefore like to offer my sincere thanks to mr van rompuy and mr barroso .
nevertheless , my group , the ecr , regards it as a personal conscience matter whether the death sentence is justifiable in the most serious crimes of terrorism and murder .
europe today is running out of steam despite the fact that it has a higher percentage of educated people than more successful countries such as china or india .
i would like to emphasise the request for the commission to conclude agreements containing clauses on democracy , human rights and compliance with social , health and environmental standards , and at the same time to ensure the effective monitoring of compliance with , and implementation of , these standards in practice .
this is not , however , a decision that we need to make this evening during this debate but rather in the context of a broader debate that relates to the financial perspective and the whole question of how to use the resources that we have at our disposal .
the 27 countries of the eu cannot fall into a situation where we transfer the problems from one country to another within its borders .
ladies and gentlemen , i invite you to adopt , not a perfect report , but a very honourable report of which we can be proud , and which will be a good working tool .
therefore , even though today the main criticism regarding the introduction of a european day against the death penalty has been levelled at poland , i fully agree with and support the view of mr schulze , mrs frassoni and mrs morgantini that the finger should also be pointed at those countries .
i share the view of commissioner barroso .
as europeans , we have absolutely no reason for hiding behind others .
he is not changing anything .
extending compulsory labelling should not impose a disproportionate burden on enterprises without bringing real added - value for consumers , who may even be confused by an excess of information on the label of textile products .
in the irish dioxin contamination incident , the use of contaminated breadcrumbs as animal feed was identified to be the source of contamination .
from a certain point of view , linking funds will mean that they can be used more effectively , and this is certainly a good thing .
if these are the same values , we must be very clear about saying ' no ' to this development !
the second aspect concerns the development of legislation encouraging a reduction in co 2 emissions by companies , particularly mutual agreements on emissions trading .
for this , you are rightly respected .
women researchers should therefore be given the opportunity to take part in programmes .
your timetable for economic recovery will help restore confidence in the markets .
we need to achieve cost reality here to really bring about a situation where market economic instruments regulate traffic .
the amending budget was submitted by the european commission on 14 april 2008 .
i wanted to highlight this before moving on to other points .
i will say , probably for the first time in this chamber , that i am impressed by both the commission 's and the council 's swift action and resolve on this issue .
i believe that in welcoming the plans of the slovenian presidency for tomorrow 's council i would propose that it also discusses this - a new communication strategy for dialogue between citizens and the european union - not just with a view to concluding the ratification of the lisbon treaty , but also in other respects .
i should like to list some of them by way of example : disputes due to a shortage of resources , particularly when access to resources is used for political purposes ; increased migration , the consequence of which is additional pressure on the transit and target countries , which could cause political and ethnic tensions ; and probable political tensions due to changes in coastal areas , disappearance of islands or problems of access to new traffic roads and to resources .
this is good news for european citizens and also for all eu institutions .
rapporteur . - madam president , i find myself in the uncharacteristic position of having the last word in this major debate so i will perhaps make a few broad - ranging remarks at the end .
the label must state what is in the product , without any possibility of misunderstanding .
the martens report is in fact the message that we are sending today to the commission and the council , and we shall be in lisbon in december to see if this message has actually got through .
this is a structural policy , this is an historic policy , and it would be tragic to abandon this policy on the pretext that the financial crisis has occurred .
this explains our position in favour of a consolidated tax base for taxation on companies and the automatic exchange of data between member states , which has already been discussed .
this could have been the subject of a european commission proposal in this regard .
in fact , it is not our door but that of the european commission .
regarding the european network and information security agency , i would like to say that i do not share the opinion of the european parliament , which rejects the commission 's proposal to transfer the responsibilities of the agency to a new european telecom marketing authority , whose tasks from 2010 would consist of ensuring that the national regulators work as an efficient team on the basis of common guiding principles , delivering opinions and assisting in preparing the single market measures of the commission for the telecoms sector .
they were clearly destined to fill the gaps as a result of the toy recalls .
the second crucial thing in the services directive is that for the first time individual member states are required to provide information to companies that want to access the single market and encourage them to use that vast opportunity .
these are the concrete points i can announce today : concrete measures concerning access to finance for smes and the reduction of the administrative burden affecting our companies , especially smes .
this is our new economic governance at work - governance that should be the comprehensive response to the crisis .
in my opinion , biotechnology offers a number of potential solutions to the current situation .
this will address the quality of treatment that victims receive in the aftermath of a crime and during the criminal proceedings .
at a time when the european union is struggling to finance its objectives and is obliged to choose between policies of equally high priority , the community budget cannot afford to fund the market entry and relocation strategies of large multinational companies whose sole intention is to increase their profits .
the economic crisis has become an acutely felt social crisis for which we have not yet found a solution .
any change to the own resources system also requires all member states to give their approval in order for it to enter into force .
because of this , it is so important that we actually make sure that the game of football and other sports are regulated properly and that we do now take the action which has been discussed for so long about players ' agents .
what did not work ?
member of the commission . - ( fr ) i do not know if this question was directed at me .
we believe that there is only one way : by ensuring that its remit includes sea rescue operations .
i miss the small business act .
i hope they will come through on this .
all the lines proposed by the commission were reinstated - many thanks for that .
i feel that all of their contributions shed some much - needed light on the report .
- ( cs ) in september last year i warned on youtube and elsewhere against the growing incidence of hazardous toys and i promised that we would take measures here to ensure that by christmas the market would be a safer place .
we currently are lacking the accurate statistical data that we need to assess the situation .
taking the european average , the income gap sets men and women 17.8 % apart .
it is for this reason that the eu strategy for this region will certainly have a very positive impact on the area and on the eu as a whole .
madam president , i often take questions for mr mitchell , my colleague .
the committee on social affairs has adopted a set of common indicators for the process of social protection and integration , which will ensure comparability of data .
firstly , cohesion policy is important as an instrument for ensuring the balanced development of the european union , with any attempt to re - nationalise these policies being rejected .
yes , this cooperation will take place .
i am pleased that the issue of employers who benefit at the expense of illegal immigrants has been raised for discussion by the european parliament .
it has also been said , however - and there are studies demonstrating it - that by 2050 , these costs may have increased to 7 % of gross domestic product , but the return from investment in preserving biodiversity is 100 times greater .
the european union will thus be well equipped to react rapidly should the need for further balance of payments support arise .
in my own country , for example , the funds we received in the last year were twice what we would previously have received in two years .
unfortunately , it appears that the commission will not manage to prepare the draft regulation in time , and , what is worse , will not have the funds to change it .
it is therefore an entirely political resolution , with no basis in fact .
their work is important .
it is , however , true that job creation is falling behind .
president obama is currently attempting - i wish him well - to introduce a national health care system , which we have practically everywhere in europe , with some differences .
we need to take action on the causes of inflation .
this is therefore one more piece in a complex policy that must be pursued and developed .
this is the direction that things are going .
it is a state that requires international assistance , a delegation from the european commission , the extension of the un mission and support from all of us for any initiatives that might help to promote unity among the east timorese people , with respect for the law and condemning all violence .
this means that we must enable the creators to distribute their work as widely as possible , without any fear of abuse from the middlemen or the consumers .
another issue is how european producers - farmers - can be competitive when in the european union we have different , higher , standards of animal welfare in relation to the environment , which are not addressed at the wto . you will only bring our citizens with you on this journey if those issues are addressed at the wto .
i am sure that we see it as an ongoing process .
the reforms of the judiciary are based on international precedents and international best practice .
while we welcome the recognition of the need to create quality jobs , resource lifelong learning , upskill and train workers on an ongoing basis , and have particular strategies to include younger workers and women , we regret that the commitments are vague and that there is an absence of concrete targets in those areas .
this economic crisis is here .
moreover , let us not forget that , in order to dissuade economic operators from acting illegally , it is important to take action both in terms of penalties against those who deliberately put dangerous or non - compliant products on the market , and in terms of transparency : any ban on products should be published .
it took a lot of strength and courage and great diplomacy to find a peaceful solution to the difficulties which we faced .
my political group , the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , welcomes the result of today 's vote on the catherine neris report on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products .
as i mentioned already , i am happy that we were able to find a compromise that we could all agree on .
finally , the new media channels , relayed in europe and worldwide , do indeed need funding , but must also be used responsibly ( for example the status of weblog authors and editors should be defined ) and greater media literacy should be encouraged throughout europe .
what action will the commission take against lithuania , then , and what will it do about romania , for example , whose legislation specifically excludes recognition ?
i think it is very helpful for all of us in the two institutions to understand each other .
there is still some way to go , and i urge both sides to make the last effort to reach an agreement capable of being approved by the parliament before christmas .
i think that we should not keep an unsustainable model so at a certain moment , we have to come back to sustainability .
and , amid this chorus of praise that will certainly appease the french government from tomorrow , i believe that we need to take an interest , first and foremost , in workers who are going to be required to work even more , without really having any choice in the matter , such as all those in france who are in future going to be asked to work on sundays .
i have voted in favour of the report on the demographic challenge , but against the paragraph which calls on the member states ' to give consideration to regulated labour migration ( immigration from third countries into the eu ) ' .
the united nations presence on the ground , in the form of the united nations operation in côte d'ivoire ( unoci ) , has been unable to protect civilians .
mr president , may i add a personal remark .
it also takes a very great deal of creativity and innovation to assemble funding packages .
8 .
the debate is closed .
in this case , the commission has not only the right , but also the duty , to voice its opinion .
the copenhagen summit is a real challenge to which we must rise and we must not allow the industrial and nuclear lobby to be the glorious victors .
in essence , this is a totalitarian programme .
the group consists of 27 representatives from the administrations of member states , from the research community , from the european enabling technology sector , from the european investment bank and from associations of small and medium - sized enterprises .
we also welcome the reference to the ilo conventions on the concept of decent work and stress that these standards must play an integral role in economic cooperation , investment and trade relations , in particular in combating child labour , which continues to be a most serious problem in those countries , especially tajikistan and uzbekistan .
we work from the point of view that interdependence in energy supply is the most important thing and is beneficial for all - for suppliers , transit countries and consumers .
these are the topics i have attempted to add to the text of the report , so that a serious debate can be opened on the issues .
( the speaker stops )
( nl ) mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , president barroso , commissioner almunia , i , too , wish to focus on the eu 2020 strategy , as the need for europe to work for its citizens and their jobs is greater than ever in these times of crisis .
i have worked on it seriously ; i have not been ideological or biased , and i have taken account of all the obstacles and been anxious to make progress .
president of the commission . - i have to remind you that it was the commission that launched the climate change and energy package and that we have highlighted the great potential for the creation of jobs in some sectors of the so - called greening of the economy and that , certainly , the priority for the future is such , one of the most important targets of the eu 2020 .
i also object to the gratuitous and unnecessary references to the treaty of lisbon , which conservatives and many others have consistently opposed .
that means before 9 may .
i would like to mention two examples .
facility providing mid - term financial assistance for member states ' balances of payments (
thank you for your support on this matter .
nonetheless , it does not provide a harmonised framework on the contents and the quality of non - promotional information for patients .
madam president , on the breyer report , i say to the commission , why are you against an impact assessment ?
the next item is the report by jan mulder , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ( ec ) no 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and regulation ( ec ) no 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the european agricultural fund for rural development ( eafrd ) - c 6-0283/2007 - .
in spite of apparent sufficiency of supplies , a significant proportion of the world 's population cannot afford the basic food it needs , and accessibility of food remains a key issue to be dealt with urgently .
ladies and gentlemen , a look at the situation of european union maritime transport can lead to ambivalent conclusions .
maximum support from the slovenian presidency in fulfilling all the priorities of its programme is essential for handling these matters appropriately , including the creation of the preconditions for croatian and turkish accession .
( de ) mr president , as i was addressed personally , i would actually like to respond for a minute under the catch - the - eye procedure .
these amendments will ensure consumers greater security , and will contribute to companies , small or large , being able to provide goods and services without unnecessary legal obstacles .
responsibility , honesty and transparency are required - and no games of hide and seek or cat and mouse by the member states and the finance ministers .
for this reason , i feel able to endorse the report by voting in favour .
the proposal envisages that the network should be composed of a secretariat , of contact points designated by each member state and of a board of directors .
many relatively isolated rural and island areas depend on wireless connections from mobile internet for access to high - speed broadband .
the new text expresses the european parliament 's dissatisfaction with the existent situation in which only the citizens of 12 member states , such as romania , are not exempted from visa for the united states of america .
i am happy to confirm that the commission strongly supports parliament 's overall approach .
but it is important , as we move towards reforming the common agricultural policy , that we continue to make those improvements .
two eu countries , poland and denmark , are responsible for negotiating a post - kyoto agreement .
on the one hand , there is heavy rainfall accompanied by flooding , while on the other , periods of drought that devastate entire swathes of europe are becoming more frequent .
6 .
i just think we need information , because if we do not get this information on injuries or effects on health , i believe it may be difficult to get consumers on board in this fight to do something about product counterfeiting .
i have no doubt google wish to uphold their famous motto ' do no evil ' .
nevertheless , if we are to defend it , we must accept that the social model will have to change in order to meet the new challenges and adapt to the new world of globalisation and the information and knowledge society .
as european politicians , we should always strive to put the citizens at the centre of our policy .
change is inevitable in the dairy sector , but there needs to be a well managed transition to provide the farmers of europe with a stable and bright future .
we propose promoting the free movement of researchers , students and scientists and adopting a unified regime on the protection of intellectual property rights .
thirdly , increased gas storage capacity is crucial for the operability of the solidarity mechanism .
it must not be forgotten that anti - communism was the ideological cement of several fascist dictatorships and a factor used by them to divide democratic forces .
i therefore think that this is an excellent solution .
why is this ?
the agreements make provision for monitoring and reviews that will involve parliament .
mr president , i think it is important to remember that this is not the first time we have talked about belarus in this parliament , and from that point of view , this resolution is important insofar as it clearly condemns the arrests and imprisonment of members of the opposition and the violation of fundamental rights to which these people have been subjected .
i voted in favour of this report .
we are working on that in order to facilitate such an agreement .
in the case of bulgaria and romania , it is 2014 .
the next item is the council and commission statements on the new eu action plan for afghanistan and pakistan .
the vote will take place tomorrow .
the debate lost its dynamism because the shadow rapporteurs were not allowed to speak either .
( es ) madam president , commissioner , today 's debate is vital so that we can express our concern about the crisis in the milk sector .
this prize embodies freedom of thought , an essential european freedom and right we stand for on behalf of our citizens and across the world .
in some countries work on the necessary legislation has been going on since 2004 and has still not been finalised .
this is a typical leftist method of solving crime problems - by banning everything and everyone and , what is more , for 30 years .
the most glaring , gaping hole in the proposal is that it does not actually prohibit the import and sale of illegally logged timber - perverse as that sounds .
similarly , mrs muscardini , you will always have my support when it comes to defending the food sovereignty of the european union .
following on from what many members have said , i wish to emphasise the stabilising role of enlargement .
approval of minutes of previous sitting : see minutes
we should make no mistake : the entire treaty - based non - proliferation system with the npt as a cornerstone is under growing pressure .
i have one brief comment for my british colleagues : as i understand it , there has only ever been one referendum held in great britain , namely on accession to the community .
the rule in my own county , sweden , is that , unless they have young children together , it is enough for people merely to give notice of the divorce .
i think it is a question of whether vulnerable ecosystems exist above this figure and not just below it , as some colleagues have questioned .
i hope it will do that .
( applause )
the first is that , today or tomorrow , in tandem with today 's debate , the greek parliament will be voting on a legislative initiative by the greek government which makes it easier and more flexible to acquire greek nationality than in the past .
we talk about citizens ' rights very often in parliament - about the right to choose , the right to obtain accurate and correct information .
she continues to live in fear for the life and health of her child .
i too have therefore backed the report of mr schmitt , which attempts to identify potential problems in the area of education that must be tackled .
in writing . - i welcome jens holm 's report on trade in raw materials and commodities .
the commission also systematically checks the ability of the member states ' competent inspection authorities to ensure compliance with food legislation , both within and outside the eu .
let me put it in straightforward terms : this flexibility is already available under the current directive , but it is not being applied by all the member states .
reopening this debate could be dangerous and unnecessary , and could cause problems with the movement of products .
the amendment concerned is apparently technical and arises from the difference in interpretation of the council and of the commission on the one hand and parliament on the other with regard to the applicability of article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union to multiannual indicative programmes .
destabilisation attempts are merely bringing them losses .
such a code is needed for reasons beyond simply harmonising the actions taken by member states .
if this is carried tomorrow by parliament , then i hope the commission will disregard it entirely because i regard this as completely irresponsible .
on the other hand , we also need to create intelligent networks .
one observer referred some months ago to this unfolding crisis as like watching a train crash in slow motion .
the proper management of reservoirs has been replaced by cost - cutting negligence by united utilities , leading to safety margins being ignored and a panic - stricken decision to open sluice gates and release a man - made deluge on the town .
then prove it !
commissioner , in building the single market , you want political and not merely economic foundations .
i must express my serious concerns about the attempts by the belarusian authorities to place in state custody danil sannikov , the three - year - old son of andrei sannikov , presidential candidate , and of irina khalip , investigative journalist , both held since the elections on 19 december .
president barroso came here not long ago to give a state of the union address , and i think we should remind him of this , clearly stating the union 's strategy with regard to the financial market .
nobody can argue with that , but the question is : on whose terms ?
it is true that the review aims to improve smes ' access to financing , but it fails to mention social and environmental issues and does not even refer to the european commission 's plan for a social business initiative , announced for the end of this year .
to achieve this , the commission , in fact , published two studies , and one year ago in this house , a resolution was approved on the same subject .
it is important not only that the european union is united on this but also that it should play a similar role to that which we played in involving other countries on other continents in order to achieve the universal moratorium on the death penalty .
that is the new idea , and , for the members on the right , this is one of the good ideas that mr sarkozy in france had ; it was called the grenelle , or round table , on the environment .
minister , you are very well aware that 32 countries already produce these npis including , i am delighted to say , france , and the czech republic , who will be holding the presidency of the council from january .
indeed , the controls being proposed will force immigrants without papers to choose even worse jobs , paying even lower salaries , especially in the current economic crisis .
that is the responsibility of the local authorities because they thought that the problems could be solved by delegating them to a firm called impregilo .
i was really positively surprised by the interest in enhancing regional integration , and cooperative attitudes also towards the forthcoming negotiations of an association agreement .
that is why i am proud to be telling parliament today and tomorrow that the pse group has made a compromise , following tough negotiations - which is as it should be on such an important matter - with the alde and ppe - de groups .
as you know , we are currently conducting further consultations on the exact form and content of the proposal , the results of which will then be incorporated into the impact assessment to be completed in the first months of next year .
when we know how we think , we know how we can also act together in the end .
it is a clear sign of the willingness of the european parliament to move towards a european legal framework for legal immigration .
nevertheless , libya has expanding commercial and political relations with eu member states , and the country is strategically important for the eu .
( es ) madam president , i am going to talk about the renewed social agenda .
if enterprises are to remain capable of innovation , they need to invest a lot of money - which is often a problem , particularly in view of the credit crunch .
ladies and gentlemen , the lesson we should indeed learn from this accident is the urgent need to strengthen security measures .
to reiterate , i agree with the rapporteur , who is of the opinion that member states should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty which makes european harmonisation of rules necessary .
we support this amendment to the regulation and we hope that this parliament will give its full support to this worthwhile proposal .
we must take relevant action instead of merely toasting our european enterprises .
two existing directives on hazardous waste and on waste oils were repealed and their provisions transferred to the waste framework directive .
little more than a decade after the creation of the euro , the warnings that we made at the time are being borne out .
it is estimated that by the year 2020 , depression will have become the most common illness in the developed world and the second main reason for incapacity for work .
i voted for the resolution in the conviction that , during the period that immediately follows , the specific measures aimed at improving the situation of the roma population will be put into practice rather than remain fine statements .
and if you stand and tell me that you will stop imported food coming in that has been actually sprayed with these particular types of chemicals - you will not !
therefore , we want , in fact , to create the conditions for investment and trade , and , in consequence , for the creation of new jobs .
i would like to emphasise three points that we absolutely must take into account in order to resolve the problem of the solvency of pensions .
in writing . - ( ro ) we fully support the commission in its effort of proposing to the member states and citizens a viable plan for achieving energy and environmental objectives .
mr schulz is right : israel needs to be protected from itself !
a social pact that is able to clearly state that this time , europe is going to make a commitment to financial and environmental sustainability , and also to preserving the social model that made us better when it made us europeans .
how will we achieve these tasks ?
all these imitation products must be labelled as such .
we have introduced action plans through which the individual countries are to achieve both a qualitative and quantitative reduction in the use of pesticides .
we cannot turn our backs on belarus .
for my part , i voted in favour of mrs ross ' nomination .
i believe that the solidarity between all european countries represented by the european commission is absolutely fundamental in this case .
in writing . - recent events have raised questions about the nature of our relations in both the short and the long term .
following sme - friendly procurement policies and allowing smes to participate in public / private partnerships will be a start .
a little bit earlier i touched briefly on the issue of memory : it plays an important role in matters of identity ; it teaches us not to repeat the tragedies of the past .
by joining the efforts of law enforcement and civil society , particularly at the local community level , it is possible to achieve better results in implementing and further developing the eu drugs strategy .
the world wide web , the gsm standard for mobile telephones , the mpeg standard for digital content and adsl technology are european inventions .
only educated women will be able to be fully involved in revitalising local communities .
how can an engine - driver be made to cross a border when he may not understand the language of the country to which he travels ?
many smes are concerned about this change .
with just one year to go before that self - imposed deadline , i cannot be the only person in this house who wonders , and becomes more than a little sceptical , about whether we will ever get there .
( applause )
that is why the commission 's opinion is positive regarding this reform of the treaty .
the workshop in stockholm on increasing access to employment focused on how to get the newly unemployed and the inactive into - or back into - jobs as quickly as possible .
however , i would like to add that many measures which need to be taken now regarding competitiveness and public finances are measures that national governments ought in fact to have taken , even without european pressure .
hopefully , that will change with the new government .
we will also be adopting this legislation in record time , showing that european laws can move at the same speed as the tgv .
the next item is the debate on the european council report and commission statement - results of the european council ( brussels , 13-14 march 2008 ) .
6 .
for its perpetrators , criminal organisations involved in prostitution and sexual exploitation , illegal adoption , forced labour , illegal immigration and illegal trafficking of organs , it is an extremely lucrative activity .
( hu ) mr president , for years , a serious , recurring problem with our budget has been the significant gap between the funds committed and the actual payments made .
i also admire the concept that you have produced .
the debate this evening has been triggered by media reports in one particular member state - germany .
its recitals detail the numerous human rights violations being perpetrated in that country today , but they omit to recall that a marxist - inspired and then military regime has been oppressing its people for decades , with support from china as is well known .
this is how the scandal is developing in greece , the scandal in which , further to confessions and convictions by german courts , state officials have been involved and included , officials who , for years , were bribed with its dirty money to award an unknown number of procurement and works contracts to siemens .
so it was important for us that the eu approach be followed and the principle of non - discrimination be respected in the new legislation through the inclusion of a prohibition on the introduction of new safety marks other than ce .
we will work so that the ratification and application of the new treaty do not leave aside the fact that the path towards a truly free , open and democratic europe is not over and that this is only a small stage , and is not even that glorious .
accordingly , export restrictions and discrimination against products are prohibited , and free trade must be guaranteed , although there are exceptions for measures in the interests of safety .
this responsibility has also been expressed through the replies made by the commissioner , the commitments made and reiterated through the various evaluation meetings arranged for february and june 2011 .
we cannot wait until all the bees have died out because the problem will be incredibly serious .
the same appears to be true with some of the smaller market regulations in the plant sector , such as , for example , the market regulations for potato starch , dry green fodder or rice , on which a regionally significant processing industry depends and has invested a great deal in recent years and has to service this with high interest rates .
capital has the ability to respond flexibly and is very mobile .
we will see what measures president obama puts in place to counter the crisis in the us motor industry .
that is also extremely important .
it is clear - those were the conclusions of the g 20 - that a global effort will be needed to relaunch the global economy .
rapporteur . - ( nl ) this high - level constructive debate today has revealed a wide consensus , both in parliament and between parliament and the commission , on the action we have to take to improve the quality of our aid .
mr president , the eu 's is the only international mission to monitor the implementation of the agreements of last august and september between russia and georgia .
the commission is determined to ensure that the basic freedoms under the treaty do not conflict with the protection of fundamental rights .
however , is this instrument really still effective , or have the terrorists already found ways of sidestepping these controls ?
i think his report is extremely good , particularly as it is the work of an entire committee sharing the common objective of benefiting young people .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , could i , too , thank the commissioner for coming here tonight to further explain the powers she seeks .
forming a partnership means that we have to include science , technology and innovation in our development policies .
my own member state , belgium , has set up the european carousel network ( eurocanet network ) that guarantees a spontaneous exchange of information .
there have not been many comments made here about that , but it is very important that iran becomes a constructive player and not a ' nuisance ' in the lives of the people of the middle east and in the establishment of peace in the middle east , as we understand the development of the peace process in the middle east .
in the same manner , tourism statistics represent a useful tool to support decision making in business and in the private sector .
this would make the measure non - discriminatory by demonstrating that the list of feedstock categories is open and that the commission is actively looking at other categories and is ready to extend the list when enough evidence and data is gathered on other categories .
the european parliament 's contribution was substantial in this matter .
i do not support the resolution because , despite the obvious deficiency of the progress made and the discrepancies with the acquis communautaire , it looks forward to accession that may take place , in my opinion , too soon .
however , even given the best possible national healthcare systems , there will still be cases where patients will need or want help , support and medical treatment from another country .
finally , i wish to say that we tabled an amendment on the internal resettlement of refugees , which was not accepted .
i hope that mr cashman will accept our proposed amendments , particularly on greater financial transparency , and i believe that as the european parliament , we should set a good example .
the debate is closed .
i would also like to underline the new principles of employment and payment , which will be transparent and meet the needs announced earlier of assistants and the end of the pension fund in its previous form .
on behalf of the ecr group . - mr president , i have been a long - standing critic in this house of the lack of human rights in the people 's republic of china .
its provisions include the obligation to provide information about implementation measures carried out by competition protection agencies which could affect the other party 's material interests .
thousands of companies throughout europe are taken in by allegedly free advertising in business catalogues , for which they are in reality required to pay anything from a few hundred to a few thousand euros .
i would like to thank the staff of the committee secretariat , the political groups and in my own private office for their splendid cooperation .
the debate is closed .
i hope that the european council will agree , either on 17 september or in october , that money should be provided to start works immediately , so that these countries can see that the european union and the developed countries really mean what they propose and what they say .
the people of campania told us the following very clearly last year : ' we have appealed to everyone for help and knocked on all manner of doors , here in our province and the region , across italy and amongst the italian government , and everywhere , we came away empty - handed .
it is important , though , to introduce taxation which is relevant to the current circumstances since , in the uk for example , barclays bank only paid gbp 113 million in corporation tax in 2009 , at well below the uk rate of 28 % , while the royal bank of scotland allocated eur 25 billion to tax avoidance schemes that year and cost the british and us exchequer eur 500 million in lost revenue .
in the context of the dialogue which the eu is leading with the venezuelan authorities , we have always stressed the importance of fully respecting international obligations and commitments on human rights , including freedom of expression and the press as a cornerstone of democracy and the rule of law .
the country 's authorities do not see any need to change the law , however , as they regard caning as an effective way to fight crime .
at our request , a major study has already been conducted on the consequences of bankruptcy in the air transport sector , particularly those for passengers .
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is clear that today we are debating a very delicate issue - one on which parliament is divided - and at the same time a very sensitive , if not tragic issue , since it can potentially have fundamental consequences for the conditions of existence and even the lives of those seeking to come to europe , even if illegally , in search of a future that their country cannot offer them .
i do not believe that an extra 2-3 % will be a huge burden , but it will show that we are taking serious steps to counter pollution .
the council has taken steps to include parliament 's wishes in preparatory actions , pilots , reserves and budgetary remarks .
oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see minutes
in my opinion , these efforts had already failed , at the latest , at the time of the presidential elections or when the offices in minsk of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) were closed .
it used to mean a freedom against state coercion : freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , freedom of worship ; it now means an entitlement .
it is of the utmost importance that local political leaders behave responsibly , show some initiative and are aware who bosnia herzegovina really belongs to and who is really responsible for its future .
the resolution emphasises that the first pillar of the pension system is the main one .
you are in a parliament that is very much alive .
of course it is difficult to face up to large waves of immigrants and asylum seekers adequately , but this is nothing new .

monitoring and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from fuels ( road transport and inland waterway vessels ) ( debate )
i think it is essential to continue to make the cohesion policy more flexible with a view to raising the currently low levels of implementation of programmes financed from community funds .
in writing . - ( fr ) i voted in favour of the report by my spanish colleague elena valenciano martínez - orozco on the functioning of the dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries .
promoting biodiversity means having more weapons in our arsenal to combat extreme poverty and hunger , through the implementation of environmental sustainability policies that maintain our rich and fertile planet .
we can go even further and say that innovation constitutes a necessary means of helping respond to many of the problems and challenges facing humankind today .
on behalf of the alde group . - ( fr ) madam president , it is just a few hours since the partisans of ouattara reached the headquarters of the government and of ivorian radio and television and i want to express my concern , because the risk of clashes and confrontation is clearly significant and absolutely real .
unless we can establish reasonably viable state and rule - of - law structures , the disaster will never end , no matter how much assistance we provide .
for this , i would particularly like to congratulate the commissioner .
it falls within the eu 's overall imperialist strategy worldwide .
it is a compliment to her work that there are no amendments tabled to this important report .
thus , we would be eliminating visa requirements on both sides .
that is worth remembering .
new provisions will enter into force on the first day of the next part - session , i.e. 12 november .
certain national legislative systems provide for financial support of olympic athletes experiencing financial difficulties after the end of their sporting careers , but the provisions concerned do not apply to paralympic athletes .

education does not have to be multicultural as stated in this report ; it only has to be of good quality .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see minutes
shamefully , president nazarbayev , who is responsible for this nightmare , is on an official visit to the european union next week and will be received by the president of parliament , mr buzek , commission president barroso and others .
you know that this new control regulation has been in force since the beginning of this year .
however , we should not simply mix the two things - the purpose of one and the purpose of the other .
at the beginning of january i met with eu finance ministers to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
the council has not taken any specific action on this issue .
mr president , as mr vondra has just pointed out , we now indeed have a legal framework which is beginning to assert itself .
lastly , before i conclude , i have a question regarding a specific matter : a number of meps have received messages , which could be described as insistent , about indonesia , all air carriers of which have been banned , requesting that we ask the commission to take indonesia off the blacklist .
i am referring in particular to the interest rate being charged by the ecb to my own country , ireland .
nuclear energy would remain unscathed by this tax .
the second event is of course the subprime crisis , which has shed light on the strategic role these sovereign wealth funds could play .
i ask the italian state to take actions in order to stop the abuses .
the commission is aware of the concern among ngos that european structural funds are being used to renovate existing , or build new , long - stay residential institutions for people with disabilities , in contravention of the rights of these citizens .
if implemented , the commission 's proposal would be extremely damaging to the interests of the southern countries , particularly portugal .
the key point of this debate is not only the specific issue being tackled by the committee on petitions , with reference to the dissemination of german in relation to its use by community institutions .
we want to maintain this agreement and help it to be fulfilled , but we also want this agreement to be used to benefit the development of papua new guinea and fiji and not to damage the spanish industry .
as the rapporteur said , under article 10 of the new regulation , the director will be appointed from a shortlist of at least three candidates submitted by the commission .
the first category concerns the preparatory activities which have to be completed in order for the lisbon treaty , if and when enforced , to be implemented fully .
volunteering also has economic value , and we must not forget this .
easing visa restrictions , we are often told , has nothing to do with migration , by which they mean , of course , legal migration .
farmers know what profits they make , how much they sell their products for , and they know how much they and other consumers pay for food .
parliament and the commission reached an agreement over two years ago to extend the scope of the solidarity fund so that it covers not just natural disasters but also industrial accidents , terrorist attacks and major public health crises .
i welcome parliament 's amendment which goes some way to protect bees , which are crucial for farmers and food supplies through pollination .
you must contribute something to this , as must croatia .
rapporteur . - mr president , before highlighting a few elements of this elaborate report on the role of culture in the eu 's external actions , i want to sincerely thank my colleagues from the committee on culture and education for their constructive collaboration and for unanimously adopting our joint work in the committee vote .
for the moment , then , i think you know that this approach appears to be disputed .
( for the results and other details on the vote : see minutes )
poland and ukraine are linked by centuries of history as neighbours .
that really should not happen in europe .
if we repeat the same old mistakes , our eur 1 billion will only buy us the pretence of a market and competition .
in writing . - according to the commission , every year , in the eu alone , an estimated 9.3 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment ( eee ) are sold annually , the biggest share of which are large household appliances and it and telecommunication equipment .
however , i would have liked it to be more ambitious - particularly as it concerns the future existence of viable fish stocks in our seas .
i congratulate the commission on a number of steps that have been very positive .
in this context , it is important to promote the fight against impunity , but also to address the root causes of the problem .
we need it - and we shall prove it by the way we vote - to protect consumers .
this is borne out by the fact that it was the only country whose government , with a green environment minister , abstained from the approval in council of the common position on the recent waste directive .
in this regard , we wish to introduce some innovations , including business - to - business and business - to - consumer contracts regulated by an optional instrument that would enlarge the parties ' choice , and the introduction of a monitoring and review mechanism in order to ensure that the optional instrument keeps up with market needs and legal and economic developments .
national spending should be transferred to the european budget in places where there are clear cost efficiencies , economies of scale and value added , and where market failure requires stronger european policies to correct it .
and , given the increase in the european parliament 's powers envisaged in the treaty of lisbon , it is understandable that its members should consider the institutional and procedural implications of the treaty , hence tonight 's debate on the five reports .
it is a very worthwhile suggestion .
( pl ) mr president , i hope that the understanding that was reached in berlin concerning the most important problems currently inherent in the reform treaty will culminate in a positive outcome during the forthcoming summit in lisbon .
we definitely do not want to erect new barriers - that is after all the main aim of euro - atlantic civilisation as a whole .
it must be a priority for the european union , and we must make sure that there is close cooperation between the member states and the european commission .
moreover , they have not taken account of the fact that , in the absence of a european directive , each member state will impose its own rules on the matter .
thank you , parliament .
where in the world does europe count ?
i have followed this report closely , since volunteering has a major importance in current society .
we would not have been able to get energy projects off the ground as part of the recovery plan - for example , by linking electricity networks from the baltic countries with those from the nordic countries , or linking the gas network in bulgaria with those of western europe , so that russia is no longer able to cut off our heating - if we had not found the money for this in the agricultural budget .
i would now like to move on to the second point .
in writing . - ( fr ) the french socialists have voted in favour of the toubon report on the single market review and its adaptation to the twenty - first century , since it refers to important aspects that are sometimes ignored when discussing the completion of the single market .
there will be no genuine reconciliation without exposing the war crimes which were committed , irrespective of which side it was that committed them .
the disagreements about a european external action service , too , are something that we cannot really afford .
these texts are anything but a trojan horse for the graduated response , and even oppose the very principle .
the oda quota must be even stricter than in the current dci .
i disagree : the state should not take a back seat , it should intervene more , should carry out more supervision in economic matters .
it must be said that the white paper on sport published by the commission in july , and the action plan relating to it , are a step in the right direction .
in my view , the simplification of the school milk regime is particularly to be welcomed .
it is precisely for this reason that support should go , for example , not only to major improvements in the quality and accessibility of education , but also to the relevance of education .
your report calls on the commission firstly to take better account of the impact of trade liberalisation and , secondly , not to be limited to the oecd principles in the fight against tax evasion and harmful tax competition .
this way , for example , agents for unblocking pipes and washing - up liquids would have the same classification and package labelling , with the result that consumers would not be able to distinguish between hazardous products and milder detergents .
however , i feel obliged to urge a note of caution .
we need to rethink our strategy here and to take decisive action to establish order .
that last issue , guantánamo bay , was one of the wrongs that badly damaged the moral authority of the united states around the world .

the aim is to guarantee that both the integration of equality and special equality measures will have prominence in future strategies .
and when you say ' never again ' , you are , once again , quite right .
a protective law only works if it is effectively applied .
practically every one of us has , at least once this year , flown with an airline that did not exist three years ago .
for this reason we will have a conference in october on using renewable sources together with countries from the mediterranean and the gulf .
it was a huge mistake to allow haradinaj , the albanian guerrilla , to leave the hague .
there is firstly the admission that the lisbon strategy objectives will not be achieved in 2010 .
( sk ) the problems associated with illegally - staying immigrants in the eu call for transparent , clear and just rules .
in my opinion , it is the wrong approach .
i realise that the current economic climate is not favourable to increasing social spending , but this is a good investment in our collective future , and it does not have the high costs that many are claiming it does .
we are sceptical towards this idea for several reasons : this post may create significant expenses which risk undermining the funding of consumer organisations .
according to the latest estimates , citizens , and thereby taxpayers , lose up to eur 100 billion every year , perhaps even more .
how should we deal with president assad ?
as i recently informed the imco committee , this is no time for knee - jerk reactions .
in writing . - ( de ) today , an attempt is being made to assert economic interests by hook or by crook .
the bureau 's working group on the members ' statute , of which i am a member , has done its job and has prepared the necessary measures , not in accordance with the wishes expressed in resolutions , but in accordance with article 27 of the members ' statute published in the official journal on 7 october 2005 .
under the fifth and sixth framework programmes , two specific projects were devoted to the development of a safe , efficacious bluetongue virus vaccination strategy .
what we need is another policy here in europe too .
i support this contribution , as i also believe that this conference should foster coherent development policies by promoting measures in all areas - such as trade , fisheries , the environment , agriculture , climate change , energy , investment and finance - in order to provide strong support for the development needs of the least developed countries ( ldcs ) , to combat poverty , and to ensure decent incomes and subsistence .
at the beginning of the budget discussions , there were still several open issues and gaps which had not been funded .
i am in favour of streamlining european union regulations , but not if you make it more bureaucratic , difficult to operate and unfavourable to industry .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to remind you what the lampedusans want .
before the european elections , we want to send people , especially fathers and mothers , a clear and definite signal that , in times of crisis , the concept of a social europe will not be abandoned , and clearly state that we aim to invest in people , in future generations and in demographic change .
the report stresses that the multi - level approach must be applied horizontally in all eu policies .
parliament did that , not the commission , which had promised to do it .
this document therefore courageously identifies the need to increase the level of transparency and competition within the energy sector , while effectively protecting the consumer from the consequences of a closed and inflexible market .
however , the difference does not extend beyond the borders of the euro area , which might be assumed to be the case from an economic perspective .
let us remember that there is a strong catholic minority , which brings it closer to neighbouring poland and the rest of europe and makes the country a strategic ally with regard to the rest of eastern europe .
madam president , i am delighted that we are debating today the proposal to reform the directive on industrial emissions and i would like to specifically thank the rapporteur , mr krahmer , and the committee on the environment , public health and food safety for their excellent work on this dossier .
you can think what you like about prime minister gyurcsány .
so it is not a blank cheque .
the signing of bilateral fisheries agreements between the eu and third countries guarantees access for eu fleets to sources of fish that are significant in quantitative and qualitative terms whilst , at the same time , channelling financial resources to these countries that often come to make up a large proportion of their budget available for pursuing policies in numerous areas , not just fisheries policy .
if opinion polls ought to be taken into account , as the rapporteur would like , put a stop to the negotiations for turkey 's membership , because the majority of europe 's citizens oppose it .
( applause )
( the president cut off the speaker )
i feel this would have been a plus in this communication .
better late than never , however .
my final point is this : mr schultz , the commission president and the commission are not our opponents .
we need to keep this matter alive in the european parliament .
we need to realise that the disappearance of bees would amount to an unprecedented upheaval in the history of mankind .
the detailed analysis mentioned earlier is currently under way and i cannot predict what the results will be .
i hope that parliament 's services , when advising the president of parliament on any future reports , go for maximum transparency and publish as much as possible in the future .
and why ?
therefore , all the attention should be directed at the public use of that money .
secondly , it is also vital , of course , that the european court of auditors analyse these exercises in detail and provide the necessary documentation .
we cannot allow such a situation to continue .
yes , there are other very important sources which have to be exploited as fully as possible , but the proposals are not the right place to address them .
the second point is that we also have to tackle the problem of the greek debt .
an illustrious career as a barrister , journalist and then a politician in portugal followed after he finished law school at university in his home town of coimbra .
but on top of all this - and i very much welcome what the minister said - we impose stigma .
we can look at this in depth and analyse the situation because , of course , if we have more competition and more intensive traffic , we should address very seriously these social aspects as well .
( de ) madam president , i would like to draw attention to the international transport workers ' federation ( itf ) 's action week , which will be manifesting itself in istanbul this weekend .
( applause )
it would be absurd and incomprehensible .
for many years , car manufacturers have had a strong monopoly on spare parts ; this is a significant element of car design .
in view of the novel nature of this structure , ambitious provisions with regard to transparency and budgetary and financial accountability need to be applied .
the continuing political unrest is hampering efforts to begin reconstruction work and help victims , and is making the situation even worse .
as a result , the development of the common agricultural policy should continue to be aimed towards improved competitiveness and , in the long term , less market management .
( the sitting was closed at 23:40 )
the piece of nonsense is free services that some people dream of , access to everything for nothing .
it is hoped that the strategy will gain the backing of the european council meeting at the end of october .
mario monti was clear in his recent work that the single market had stalled .
such a system would aid the prevention , investigation and elimination of transgressions of both community laws and national laws .
consequently , i voted to reject the commission 's legislative proposal .
madam president , the original sin committed when this new country , namely kosovo , was born involved the feeling , prevalent amongst the serbian minority in kosovo and metochia , as well as in serbia itself , that the new state , and the entire muslim majority , were set against the serbs .
in particular , consumers will be given a 14 day cooling - off period during which they can withdraw from the agreement without any consequences , which will help them to think over their decision .
that has been criticised by some members of this chamber because it provides funds for the president of tunisia 's justice system .
the report also calls for efficient goods transport , including reliable loading and unloading systems to facilitate last - mile operations , acknowledging the need to promote the co - existence of mobility of people and goods .
i have taken note of the assessment of the report on the policy options presented in the green paper and the support for the innovative solution of an optional instrument , which means no harmonisation but giving consumers and businesses a choice of having a europe - wide system .
our report is intended to encourage the commission to intensify its efforts to simplify the common agricultural policy ( cap ) in a tangible way .
drugs that are grown and produced in afghanistan find their way onto the streets of europe .
we now have some studies on the potential of tax incentives for energy and environmental purposes , and the commission is preparing a proposal to amend the vat directive to allow reduced rates of vat to apply to certain environmentally - friendly goods and services .
member of the commission . - mr president , i wish to thank parliament for its work on this issue .
i would like to draw attention to the fact that bulgaria can only partially accept the proposals to amend regulation 1234 .
i should like to say a couple of words about the treaty that has been referred to by the rapporteurs .
who knows whether you know or pretend not to know that this schooling was entrusted , almost as a monopoly , to a few associations that were motivated not so much by the best interests of minors as by the availability of public money .
my country , cyprus , is at the centre of one such problem , but i , like most people in this chamber , realise that problems are not solved by conflict , but by peaceful negotiation .
however , there is always a dilemma in sending funds and resources to developing countries , to poor countries to help them develop .
the issue of the restriction of access to the labour market is directly related to the first principle suggested by the rapporteur , namely " european action against abusive practices in various types of non - standard contracts " .
the problem with the method is that we are making use of an artifice , for which we thank mrs fraga , which is that of the oral question , to talk about something that should really , after the treaty of lisbon , be a parliamentary right .
2006 discharge : european centre for the development of vocational training (
my second remark is that the short - term operation atalanta has already prevented several acts of piracy from taking place and apprehended a number of pirates , so within a month of deployment the effectiveness of the operation has already become apparent .
( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , by means of this short speech , i should like to show my disagreement with the possible suspension of duties in favour of pakistan for some three years and across 74 tariff lines , almost all of them in the textile and clothing sector .
i voted for the directive because it is in line with my views on health protection .
for us , this leads to the precept of the unconditional protection of human dignity and the promotion of a dialogue of cultures , which have been guiding principles during my term of office .
however , in the conference of presidents , we asked for the two things to be kept separate : the urgent issues which we are discussing now , in other words , the imminent executions , and the question of the relationship between the european union and china on economic , cultural , political and defence issues and in other areas .
only 47 % of the electorate took part , and in slovakia , which i represent here , the figure was as low as 11 % .
after the completion of the impact assessment i intend to submit to this parliament in september a proposal that allows the continuation of this scheme but on a very solid basis for the future .
typically engaged in maternity and their usual role of supporting other family members , women are undoubtedly disadvantaged in an agricultural context .
we should be clear that it would be fitting to consider a strategy for how to deal with this situation .
i do not imagine that belarus will benefit from what is being offered under the eastern partnership without the prior re - legalisation of the union of poles in belarus and the return of its property , and , in addition , without the release of political prisoners such as andrei bandarenko , ivan mikhailau and arystom dubski .
in this context , we need legal certainty and , therefore , an extension of the monopoly over a longer period .
the causes of the accident are not yet fully known and the technical investigation has been launched in accordance with the provisions of the eu safety directive .
it is true that the crisis in greece is very serious , but we all well know that it may , unfortunately , spread .
at the same time , approximately 80 million european citizens are below the poverty threshold .
european gas consumers cannot be left at the mercy of monopolies .
i therefore call on the commission to follow the recommendations of the durnwalder report , in the committee of the regions , and to include in the assessment of european territories the energy issues and the production capacity of mountain regions in terms of renewable energy and passive construction .
the bangladeshi authorities are not doing a lot to support the economy in the country , where food prices have risen by more than a third in recent months , and where a quarter of the territory is threatened by a constant risk of flooding and humanitarian disaster .
in writing . - i support this report which takes up the serious problem of female genital mutilation .
( applause )
maybe we could come to an agreement and you , with the bureau and with the vice - presidents , could agree that this section , question time , is sacrosanct and that that will not be changed .
with regard to the post - 2013 regional policy , i endorse the idea of setting up intermediate regions , thereby enabling regions with a gdp between 75 % and 90 % of the eu average to receive real support , however , through finding suitable solutions .
certain scientists believe that another cause for this phenomenon is the electromagnetic wave radiation emitted from mobile phones , which penetrates the bees ' navigation system , leaving them unable to return to the hive .
this is an historic moment : the europe of health is being built , and cross - border healthcare will no longer be a risk , but an opportunity .
( lv ) thank you , mr president .
the report before us welcomes iraq 's observer status at the wto as a key step towards driving iraq 's integration in the international economy and it looks forward to the eu - iraq trade and cooperation agreement .
a twofold picture is emerging where agriculture and other major debit entries on the budget are concerned .
but , through the consumer market scoreboard , one of the main topics of our investigations will be prices and part of this basket will be about food prices .
those who argue that all women should be paid the same as men for perceived similarities in the job description miss the point entirely that no individual is an economic unit .
i wish the citizens ' initiative all the best .
first , at european level , we have only one key thing we should do in order to increase competitiveness and that is the single market .
one of the results of the iraq war has been israel 's recognition of the fact that it is no longer the us 's sole ally in the middle east .
i therefore hope that something is done soon to improve airport passenger services which , as in the case of rome airport , are often unsatisfactory .
where do we stand on this ?
i will pass on your complaint , and then perhaps you will be contacted about the matter .
written statements ( rule 149 )
europe is the largest importer of produce from the developing world .
there is legislation in force which must be respected .
madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , against the backdrop of the current economic and financial crisis , this g 20 summit forces us to conclude that the first objective that we must achieve is that of making workers more employable .
the president - in - office of the european council ( in edinburgh in december 1992 ) confirmed these imperatives .
therefore , the subsidies still being given to transport , energy , and publicly owned businesses should be reduced so as to ensure free competition within the european internal market .
but could you elaborate more on the eur 100 000 threshold ?
i believe that there is a need for us to continuously keep all those concerns and questions you have voiced here in relation to solidarity - concerns which pertain exactly to the poorest countries - on the agenda , and to look for joint solutions , but to give a green light to this banana trade agreement and the law repealing the previous agreement . i therefore ask the european parliament to decide on expressing its consent to the banana trade agreement tomorrow .
i also believe that this regulation will ensure that the unscrupulous trade is stopped and that harmonised rules will be developed to change the whole internal market .
this is the work we have done , increasing the budget and improving local activities and eu - wide activities for the benefit of the associations .
the chair of the european parliament election observation mission was paweł kowal .
following the ajka sludge accident , the commission will take stock of the lessons learnt at european level and , in particular , the appropriateness and the correct implementation and enforcement of european environmental legislation ; the measures needed to make sure that the affected population and industry at risk are covered by appropriate insurance schemes ; and the way forward to strengthen european disaster monitoring and response capacity and enhance our instruments to express solidarity with our members and our citizens in moments of need .
when we look beneath the surface , therefore , the resources used are very often revealed to be on a more equal footing than the image created might suggest .
we also have to allocate more funds to the european participants in the programme .
first of all my message is very much to you , mr schulz , because i want you to remember what you argued here in this parliament two years ago .
subject : initiatives by the slovene presidency regarding a new approach to neighbourhood policy and energy
let me instead open a brief parenthesis to place the agreement with korea in the wider perspective of the future of eu trade policy , as sketched out by the commission in its communication of 9 november 2010 , and to recap the basic tenets of our policy line .
it sets out sound , transparent regulations on the authorities competent to consider international protection applications and guarantees that these applications are handled as quickly and efficiently as possible .
deputising for the author . - i would like to thank the czech presidency for the chairing of the committee and their views on this .
most people , other things remaining equal , would prefer to remain with their own people in their own countries .
i am being told that the presidency of the council had not been informed that the debate was a joint debate on the european neighbourhood policy and the situation in georgia .
but there is no certainty that the international carbon market will deliver eur 38 billion a year in financial flow to developing countries .
it is obvious that in the current situation , when these businesses are in such need of funding and obtaining finance is so difficult , we must not take measures on their behalf , for example accounting guarantee exemptions , that cut their credits and therefore prevent them from having the means to operate .
they may be serious and scientifically correct .
my second point : i welcome president obama 's commitment to diplomacy with the islamic republic of iran .
this has given rise to feelings not only of surprise but also of displeasure within the european parliament and , as the rapporteur , i have felt the same .
in europe - and this is true in france and everywhere else - we are weighed down by too many administrative rules .
with the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon , the distinction between compulsory expenditure and non - compulsory expenditure has been suppressed , which means that parliament and the council are becoming jointly responsible for all eu spending , and that they decide upon it together .
that can sometimes rather weaken our actions .
but the increase in demand for wilderness tourism puts pressure on the very same values that the tourists are seeking and can speed up the destruction of fragile ecosystems .
basing itself on the overall outcome of these meetings , the commission will compile the results , which will then serve as an input for the various council configurations in may and june .
it is regrettable that , six years on , the new elites still cannot accept the orange revolution as a genuine expression of popular will .
it may also lead to the opening of a significant number of investigations in which the initial suspicions ultimately prove to be groundless .
after all , on the one hand we are in a position to control them , and on the other to ensure economies of scale .
but what is happening at eu level ?
however , the report fundamentally emphasises the role of vocational training in promoting entrepreneurship and the need to ' create an environment where enterprises can succeed , develop and grow ' , adding that ' to grow , they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments ' .
what are the new challenges ?
the austrian police stopped a truck containing137 puppies .
i believe that , with a postponement , there would be a very good chance of reaching a broad consensus over the calendar for 2012 .
this will even apply to workers who are subject to the principle of equal treatment and who are covered by what mrs mathieu said .
the report responds to these threats by seeking a pro - active diplomatic role for the european union .
the debate is closed .
the amendment to paragraph 2 , which should have been the one we took last time , is : ' believes that a military victory over the ltte , as envisaged by the government of sri lanka , will not obviate the need to find a political solution in order to ensure a lasting peace ' .
nevertheless , we would have preferred to see stronger provisions on warnings on spirit bottles and on the risks of alcohol use by women during pregnancy .
admittedly , we must strengthen the growth and stability pact and deficits must be more closely monitored , and even penalised .
mr president , the vote today on the romeva report should , i hope , reassure european anglers that their concerns have been recognised .
well , then , both the cortés lastra report and my report on behalf of the committee on regional development concern policy synergy with a view to increasing output , or results , for europe .
i see that as the best way to obtain the support of the g - 77 .
thank you , mr president .
however , it is clear that the casualty figures claimed by the ltte have been exaggerated .
( pt ) one thousand is the number of the day , one thousand deaths to teach a black lesson .
it has also not been possible as yet to agree on a common position between safety experts , aircraft manufacturers , airlines and market regulators .
a way forward in terms of free and equal access to healthcare services for all citizens would be to scrutinise public contributions to treatment in private hospitals and tax credits for private health insurance .
we should not disregard this severe breach from the ideals of democratic elections .
the whole country has been in a state of emergency for 18 months and there are no free elections on the horizon .
the commission is therefore committed to ensuring a prompt follow - up to the transport council conclusions as adopted on 4 may 2010 .
i have just noticed that the computer cloned me , because my name , the tabajdi name , appeared for my colleagues who had cards inserted .
in writing . - ( pt ) it is well - known that , in july 2006 , the commission presented a thematic strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides , together with a proposal for a directive establishing a framework for community action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides and a proposal for a regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market , with the aim of reducing the general risks and negative impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment .
it has to do with the fact that my voting machine malfunctioned in the vote on amendment motions 34 and 35 .
the commission fully shares this position .
let us be honest , once again .
i voted for this report because it calls on the council and the commission to rapidly review and strengthen the action plan according to the recommendations in this report and to ensure its swift implementation , given that cbrn accidents or attacks pose serious threats to the security of the people living in the european union and can disrupt critical infrastructures and the normal functioning of societies in one or more eu member states without any respect for borders .
because of the traditional division of roles and the weak infrastructure in many areas , such as child care , for example , many women never feature in the official labour market , but at the same time they are not registered as unemployed .
both reports ultimately stress the positive impact of this measure .
the amendments proposed : placing the eu at the forefront of these technologies , guaranteeing priority support for long - term research , supporting the rules for use and dissemination being adapted to those for participation in fp 7 , strengthening the scientific committee with the function of setting the scientific priorities and preventing the regulation from requiring the consortium coordinator to come from an industrial group , are issues that strengthen the commission 's proposal .
as the coordinator from the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) for the committee on employment and social affairs , i would simply like to confirm that we support in every single dossier tabled before us one of the most important items for us , namely , the protection of jobs and the creation of new jobs .
unfortunately , many states have not yet implemented the eurovignette 1 infrastructure payments and , most likely , these same states will be very tardy in implementing eurovignette 2 .
this place is getting to look more like a university students ' union than a parliament , madam president , and i hope you will take action to stop it .
the irish government has published a recent report concluding that , so far , no adverse short - or long - term health effects have been found .
the first of these areas is transport .
my question to the council was identical to this , but question time with the council has now been cancelled , without a replacement .
we have set a standard for future agreements .
as a matter of fact , in 2004 , parliament sought the annulment of the agreement with the us before the european court of justice .
3 .
these four basic priorities of my group are :
it is not enough to talk about supervision and regulation .
in sports and politics alike , we have to get used to the fact that one or two influential or central politicians may try to sway decisions and results , but actual outcomes are determined by concerted teamwork , dedication and fair play .
protection of the rights of the child as an internal and external objective of the european union was included in the lisbon treaty .
author . - ( fr ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , initially , we did not wish parliament to consider right now the situation in burundi , for , as you know , the burundian authorities are currently negotiating with the fnl , the national liberation forces ; they have reached a critical stage which is finally presenting a positive outlook and which should , we hope , lead to the practical implementation of the agreements entered into in dar es salaam that aim to put an end to the fighting , violence and insecurity affecting the country .
6 .
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal currently on the table is to be welcomed .
is it simply that those opposing them did not accept the benefits of trade liberalisation , which i do , and just wanted to keep protectionism ?
we , or i , therefore ask you to think about whether a directive would be necessary for regulating this important area .
however , the communist party of china recognises only one charge , only one monotonously repeated charge , and that is of criminal separatism .
subject : european monetary fund
i congratulate the council for getting their act together and taking decisive action .
i voted in favour of the report by my colleague mr casaca because it clearly underlines the perverse effects of the current system , which sometimes causes decisions to be taken that are disconnected from local realities .
this has allowed the execution of people without trial .
the parliament will support you on that .
my second point is about the common external action service .
however , until this was verified and for purely precautionary reasons , all consignments were regarded and treated as potentially contaminated .
the energy strategy has become both part of europe 's foreign and security policy and a question of security of supply .
it is therefore also crucial that everyone contributes by quickly and effectively implementing the eu legislation that has to transposed into national law .
that is why we set up reach .
securing human rights and democracy must be the priority of the external action service and an unequivocal criterion in bilateral agreements with third countries .
in writing . - ( pl ) croatia has made successful efforts to overcome existing divisions and to achieve unity between peoples , which is one of the aims of european union membership .
while i advocate legislative stability , it is because we are living through exceptional times that i support the currently proposed amendment of article 136 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union to such an extent as to enable the creation of a permanent mechanism to safeguard the stability of the euro area , as proposed in report , adopted by this chamber on 20 october 2010 .
on this issue there is a similarity between us .
it will be called upon to continue the work to take us towards our goal of seeing the lisbon treaty enter into force .
let us avoid the usual proclamations and fine resolutions , the declarations of intent .
based on the facts , yet not forgetting the political criterion i mentioned , i feel that the perfect , ideal centre would appear to be the polish city of wrocław , whose history has been created over the centuries , in part by the czechs , austrians , jews and germans , as well as the poles .
therefore , we need to introduce improvements in the food hygiene regulation so that inspectors have more legal certainty and more legal powers .
the railway sector is strategic for socioeconomic development .
i think it would be good to have a greater political presence of the greens in the institutions of the canary islands , but with initiatives like this , full of demagogy and false accusations , believe me , i would like to say to the member tabling the amendments , you are going in the wrong direction and you will have less and less political and social support in the canary islands .
some questions were about goods - only deals .
in india , whole families live off the money that the children earn .
however , i believe what is missing from this report is the massive opportunity to cooperate with developing and emerging countries .
an inclusive dialogue is required , leading to a political settlement .
i think we have found a compromise that is acceptable to all parties in the matter of delegated acts .
member states will only recover economically if the eu manages to remain competitive , and that is dependent on there being investment in research and education .
- before the vote
i think that is a major area that we need to work on .
the actions undertaken by a coalition of european , arab and north american countries implementing the un resolution have helped protect the civilian population of libya .
we have the guarantee of annual impact assessments .
i recall counting 87 .
i would like to affirm - despite the force of other ideas , which have had many problems in terms of application - our commitment to a vision of social cohesion , a vision in which it is essential for democracy to be social in nature .
10 .
like your rapporteur , mr rangel , i am also of the opinion that this revision is a significant achievement which will deepen the relations between our institutions and offer practical solutions in line with parliament 's increased competences following the entry into force of the lisbon treaty .
in essence , it is now possible to monitor the application of these rules much more rigorously than it was in 1985 .
as rapporteur in previous years for the subject of better law making , i would like to highlight several aspects of this problem .
needless to say , the same applies to the palestinians .
as commissioner michel understands the importance of education both within europe and beyond its borders , and i personally deal with students from belarus , as we educate many of them at the catholic university in lublin , i would like to say the following : commissioner , as much as it is possible , i would recommend increasing both financial and other assistance for this purpose , because investment in the education of belarusian students will help belarus itself , and will prove an investment for europe .
therefore , such an initiative will offer them a significant assurance that the european union is still thinking about them and is prepared to invest in developing relations with them .
it is , however , true that this obvious case must be submitted to the international court of justice .
because the environmental bonus has helped it to sell more clean cars than dirty ones .
another point worthy of mention is that the imf , the us treasury department and the german chancellor are calling for increased controls and regulation .
the fear of doing things wrong in the eyes of the commission is great .
the commission needs to conduct research on the gender effect in pension reforms in europe and i am sure that viviane reding will do that .
i have also naturally expressed the council 's willingness , readiness and commitment to do its utmost within that international framework to ensure that the measures it provides for are effectively applied .
our new constitution is the collection of our shared values ; it starts with our most beautiful national prayer which also emphasises the importance of our common european values , and it finally places the appreciation of our christian roots and family - our key values - where it belongs .
the recent attacks on members of the opposition are worrying , and it is necessary to make the iranian regime see that such behaviour only leads to greater international isolation .
if we were in the ancient roman senate , a senator would surely stand up in his toga and say to mr trichet : ' quousque tandem abutere , trichete , patientia nostra ? ' - how long are you going to try our patience , mr trichet ?
we in europe must preserve the tradition of offering our people care and solidarity .
this is testimony to the eu pledge to help the country recover from successive crises .
in conclusion , from the bottom of my heart , i would like to thank the member of the commission for our long cooperation in the areas of gender equality , employment and social affairs .
it was excellent teamwork , with very close cooperation on this ambitious report .
we have political discussions with pakistan ; we had a summit with them recently , and we will continue to have such discussions .
the fp 7 is one of the largest research programmes in the world , and it is good for us to do the mid - term evaluation .
canada has agreed to resolve the difference in exchange for a bilateral regulatory dialogue on biotechnology issues .
this seems highly dangerous , because the irish , the french and the dutch are able to send 31 and this would cause us real problems .
i welcome the new college of commissioners and president barroso and congratulate them on the result of this election .
however , the recommendation to fully open the nabucco project to russia is questionable since everyone knows that nabucco was conceived as an alternative to russian gas and that , consequently , russia is already doing everything possible to kill it .
( es ) i would like to put a few very simple questions to mr almunia , without the difficulties of translation .
their rights must be protected , but they need to be more aware and have greater knowledge .
if i recall correctly , this was in fact a unanimous decision taken by the conference of presidents .
it is now clear that the human and financial resources allocated for the implementation of sis ii will have to be shared between the three projects being developed simultaneously : sis ii , sisone4all and the installation , operation and management of a communication infrastructure .
i do not need to tell this audience about europe 's proud tradition of protecting citizens from government invasion of their privacy - a commitment grounded in respect for the inherent dignity of all people .
is it the case that we are appeasing our conscience by having formulated such a resolution ?
the first message that i passed on there was the importance of achieving progress on the negotiations that will finally start at the san josé process in costa rica .
thus we provided guarantees on the ioannina compromise without undermining the integrity of the process of qualified - majority decision - making .
i would like to thank commissioner šefčovič and the belgian presidency , particularly mr chastel , and their teams .
however , at the same time i firmly believe that the principles of the charter also need to be included in a robust energy agreement within the framework of the post - pca agreement with russia .
we must exert greater pressure with regard to the agencies .
as a representative of bulgaria , one of the last member states to join , i feel it is paramount for european institutions , and in particular the european parliament , to send the community 's inhabitants today a clear message of support to show that we are there to help in the difficult times of an economic crisis .
( nl ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it has been said that around 850 million people suffer from hunger or are undernourished each day .
voters in ireland were the only ones with the opportunity to make their decision directly a year and a half ago .
now we are going .
although i regret this , i can do nothing to remedy the situation and we are thus obliged to hold the debate as planned .
after more than 18 months of an inhumane blockade , the 22 days of brutal israeli aggression against the palestinian people in the gaza strip have led to the deaths of at least 1 324 people and over 5 000 wounded , most of whom are children .
secondly , i believe that the participation of actual participants and civil society organisations should also be increased .
on the contrary : economic rationale speaks against the extra millions of kilometres and also the extra tons of co 2 and other greenhouse gases which are the result of fuel tourism .

the time for simply debating the situation in burma within the international arena is over .
let us then vote now on whether to take a vote .
my colleague , commissioner ferrero - waldner , had an extensive debate with you on tibet in march , where she outlined the eu 's position .
while this remains the case , we should not be acting as if the lisbon treaty is already in force .
i am confident that the president - elect of the commission will honour the promises he has made to this parliament , which should result in a revised framework agreement .
some information will therefore need to be pre - vetted .
this question has been posed by our colleagues here and , yes , we do need it .
in its statement , following the nato summit , the slovenian presidency has called for the negotiations on the name issue to be continued , and to be concluded as soon as possible .
the icrc has , since january 1998 , been gathering information on people who disappeared in kosovo .
this does not mean that we were on our own - because that was not the case at all - but that it was up to us to take the initiative , it was up to us to show that the european union is reactive , particularly in a situation where the institutional problems are unresolved .
second , we have asked the european centre for disease prevention and control ( ecdc ) to do a scientific risk assessment , which is being updated regularly as the situation evolves .
they appreciate resoluteness and strength in others , more than complicated explanations which say that ' black is not quite black ' .
it is not , therefore , a rigid solution which imposes geographical criteria of this type when recruiting staff for the future service , but a flexible and auxiliary measure .
the discharge procedure should be simplified and streamlined for the decentralised agencies , which are growing in number ( from 8 in 2000 , to 20 in 2006 ) and represent a total budget of around eur 1 billion .
the european parliament 's proposals pave the way for an environment of economic stability , while at the same time allowing for the development of innovative action mechanisms , such as eurobonds and european project bonds .
i fully agree with him that the community as a whole should finance aid for the deprived , and that the food should come exclusively from eu countries .
there is a real risk that the dignity and decorum of many refugees may suffer with the inevitable delays , although we are certain that mrs malmström will once again make sure her words are well received .
the commission is favourable to consolidation of the community air sector , which it still considers to be too fragmented , particularly in view of the current crisis .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on foreign affairs . - ( de ) mr president , firstly i would like to give my support to the three - step approach to the mid - term review developed and presented by mr böge .
let me say one final word on the link between migration and overfishing .
however , it is this sort of protection that is urgently needed .
we must create legal employment opportunities .
from the point of view of the participants of economic processes , it is necessary , above all , to specify businesses ' and consumers ' rights of protection and to continue to monitor effectively the implementation and enforcement of legal regulations in the area of the single market .
the number of reports of child - abuse material processed by the network and passed on to law enforcement authorities has increased by 15 % in recent years , so we can really see the importance of those hotlines .
i believe that the european commission must introduce regulations as quickly as possible in order to put an end to this situation . it is dangerous , it is wrong and something must be done .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i believe that the situation that has arisen recently deserves thanks on our part both to the commissioner and to the rapporteur .
the union must honour its commitments .
there , mr barroso , are some of the questions facing you .
this means that the cost of goods for the european population will fall , and that exporters will be able to charge prices for goods supplied from third countries more efficiently .
today , you personally proposed in your statement that it be extended to seven years , which obviously means that a computational error was made .
i personally very much applaud the effort to provide the best possible protection to victims also by ensuring the necessary legal certainty , among other things .
( de ) mr president , thank you , mr ashworth , for this excellent report .
meanwhile , the commission , with the member states , has committed to work with the mexican government on an operational document that specifies the practical actions that will optimise the strategic partnership .
the european summit claimed to be determined to learn lessons from the crisis and to make all those involved in the financial system act more responsibly , including with regard to pay and other inducements .
increasing oil production is a key element of this process .
much of this flooding happened in my region , and i can testify to the appalling damage and hardship which it brought on many residents of my area .
firstly , on the subject of chemicals , the rules laid down here cannot be made any stricter than they currently are .
you know that the structural funds are spent on a system of shared responsibility between the commission and the member states .
in my opinion , mistakes that have been made for a long time are now being revealed in greece - often , more comes to light in a crisis than in good times .
as cuba has become a signatory of these legally binding international instruments it has , of course , accepted the obligations arising out of them .
however , the scale of the disaster greatly exceeds the country 's capabilities , as mr barroso and mr schultz have had the opportunity to find out .
in march or april of next year , we will definitely be able to report that our economic recovery programme is having a very positive effect , in the form of both large projects and small , decentralised projects , and is allowing us to learn lessons which will be important in future financial years .
it has been very clear from the beginning , in my contact with the different rapporteurs on the whole package , that there would have to be some amendments .
the assessment that some member states have given , particularly our commissioner , mr tajani , regarding the operation of this pilot project , is relatively unsatisfactory ; the fact that the commission no longer writes directly to those who have been accused of a possible infraction greatly reduces the capacity of an administration that is guilty , let us say , of this alleged breach , to be motivated to respond .
congratulations once again .
srebrenica is , and will remain , a sensitive and important factor in the political life of bosnia and herzegovina and also of the eu and wider international community .
i voted in favour of this document , codifying council directive 80/181 / eec of 20 december 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to units of measurement and the repeal of directive 71/354 / eec .
we cannot accept that countries should run up national debts without limitation .
these are primarily immigrants from the east .
the few amendments to the report calling for further progress on nuclear energy , and supporting headway on nuclear fusion , can hardly mitigate its negative impact on the whole european economy and agriculture .
it is perfectly clear that we are in favour of this information for consumers , information which social security and health authorities in europe are also calling for , precisely because it is a means of combating obesity and a number of diseases .
you will be adding a new system , you will be adding a layer of complexity , you will be adding regulatory arbitrage instead of creating tax harmonisation .
it is essential and important , ladies and gentlemen , to disseminate practices and know - how and enhance learning through ad hoc vocational training programmes dedicated to the cultural and creative sector .
it is good for citizens , it is good for businesses , and it contributes to integration .
nutrition claims which have been used in a member state before 1 january 2006 in compliance with the national provisions applicable and which are not included in the annex to regulation ( ec ) no 1924/2006 may continue to be used for three years after the regulation comes into force .
we think that a balanced approach to reducing administrative burdens is necessary .
the indignation of the population , which has been vividly demonstrated , is entirely understandable in this case .
i should like to remind the house that georgia has stalin to thank for its present borders .
several violations of human rights have taken place in recent months , among many others .
mental health disorders are national health problems in many countries , as they have a significant influence on the people involved , their families and society in general .
we will be vigilant regarding the deadlines for applying these conventions while , of course , respecting the principle of subsidiarity .
this is not all that we can do , of course , so i very much welcome the proposal by mr ferreira to enhance our research efforts on aquaculture .
instead , it makes provision for environmental criteria to be set for selected categories of products , so that the logo can be awarded to the best products in each category .
it also supports the introduction of comprehensive and compulsory legislation for ' place of farming ' labelling .
basque society rejects its crimes .
madam president , i can accept this amendment because it is self - evident .
striking an intelligent balance in the basel measures themselves and the way in which we transpose them into our legislation .
in fact , i have a lot of faith in that .
my committee noted with concern the conclusions from the commission stating that the full implementation of the environmental legislation in the community cannot be ensured .
with regard to the economic recovery and reflationary plan discussed by the ecofin council yesterday , the ministers agreed with the commission 's view that , given the economic situation and the recession affecting the united states , japan , the euro area and some major eu economies outside the euro area , a fiscal stimulus is essential .
written statements ( rule 149 )
they end up drowning their sorrows and the three pesos they have earned in alcohol at the makeshift bars where they find refuge .
pushing ahead with the vote before even listening to all the facts confirms that , just as the employment committee is the last place to defend employment , just as the committee on fisheries is the last place to defend fisheries ...
in some areas , improvements on the original compromises were actually necessary , one example being in relation to agriculture .
in short , european service providers must be able to work without bureaucratic hindrance anywhere in the european union .
fear of infection has evaporated .
the internal market in these goods has changed a great deal since then .
written statements ( rule 149 )
before going ahead with the vote , i must inform you that , at its meeting on 12 may last , the conference of presidents decided , in accordance with rule 134 of the rules of procedure , to hold an extraordinary session on wednesday , 23 june from 15.00 to 17.00 .
parliament should not delay this money , which would give the region a much - needed economic stimulus .
it seems to me that we are moving in the right direction .
this document is also extremely important because , during this period , we discuss the reform of the common agricultural policy as well and , in this context , the community mechanisms for promoting agricultural products should play an important role .
