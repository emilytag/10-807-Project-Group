i would also like to thank the entire bank 's staff for their excellent cooperation , especially president maystadt and vice - president kolatz - ahnen .
i find this incredible .
we thus did not achieve what we were hoping for in this regard .
both personally and on behalf of the presidency , i hope that we will ensure that the member states ' obligations in this field , in respect of the council decision , are fully respected and that , together with the general secretariat of the council , we will ensure that these obligations are met by the deadline , i.e. by the end of this year , which is the end of our presidency .
in addition , some provisions , particularly the recommendations on the reuse of animals and on the proposed use of only f 2 primates ( second - generation primates ) are likely to mean that many more animals will have to be used .

the exemplary attitude on the part of islamic ngos and an uncompromising public stance on the statements by the prime minister have nevertheless calmed the situation .
i must particularly thank my friend , minister lenarčič , who i worked with on the security council some years ago , dealing precisely with iraq and the problems caused for iraq by saddam hussein .
it is incumbent upon us to think about all those people who have begun the transformation process and are carrying it out during a time of crisis and investment difficulties .
( de ) mr president , mrs malmström , we are talking today about the judgment passed by the european court of human rights .
so we should not badmouth it but should actually endorse it tomorrow by a large majority .
this is what we are asking of europe .
however , we must take care that it does not lose its effectiveness as the reasons why people migrate remain the same , regardless of whether penalties are introduced against the employers or not .

i can assure you that this impact assessment will be conducted very thoroughly .
the european union pays enormous subsidies to environmental pressure groups that agree to advise the eu to follow a policy to which it is already committed .
perhaps i might look again at this issue and try to incorporate it into the current discussions , and then come back to you to see how we might arrange it .
worse , amendment no 8 - if adopted - allows the collating agency to reject as inappropriate national figures and substitute figures of their own .
finally , i want to refer again to yesterday 's discussion .
involving the arab league is a significant opportunity to bring all states together to jointly find solutions for conflicts in the region .

i welcome that agreement was reached on first reading .
the commission proposal , made in fact without the involvement of any branch of the budget authority , provides for an appropriation of eur 75 million to be entered into the reserve pending the adoption of the relevant amending regulation .
these are important reasons which justify support for this report .
last but not least , i am concerned about the role that the european parliament should play in relation to eurojust .
we have adopted many resolutions in this parliament .
in writing . - i will be voting in favour of this report .
the value of social dialogue , of reaching solutions through discussion and negotiation , and of an awareness of the good and interests of the other party all point to the need to respect the results of this dialogue .

we must maintain european solidarity while adhering to rules and principles that stem from the eu treaty .
if you allow me , i would like to recognise the young boy behind seat no 582 , because the future of north korea is relevant to the future of our children .
these are sensible and necessary moves which will guarantee political acceptance in future and also the acceptance of the citizens for this type of european policy .
( es ) madam president , commissioner , it goes without saying that i congratulate the representatives of the commission and parliament on the work they did in bali .

i voted in favour of this report .
the recommendation for second reading goes further , by taking proper account of the potential of e - health .
rule of law is at the heart of any democratic process and the functioning democratic system cannot be sustained without an independent judiciary .

in addition , these measures , as you said at the end of your speech , should not bring about new legislative problems which would apply additional pressure to the competitiveness of the european car industry .
the fishing sector and the processing industry are those most interested in seeing sustainable fisheries , which is why they are involved in the preparation of the reform or are participating in it , for example , in the revision of a control regulation in 2009 , which should have been drawn up in a more open manner .
others have mentioned others .
this is why the signing of such agreements is important for the sustainable development of populations that depend on the atlantic .
this is much welcomed .
our landscapes , soils and river systems are all the result of natural and ongoing climate change .
this dialogue is an important element of our support for tajikistan in its work on promoting cooperation with its neighbours and finding solutions to urgent , complex regional problems such as climate change , water and border controls .

small and medium - sized enterprises are the vital heart of europe 's economy , both in terms of growth and innovation , and in terms of employment .
the g 20 leaders expressed their renewed commitment to reaching a swift conclusion of the doha round .
it seems to me that when we are having to deal with challenges such as the economic crisis and the need to create growth , we should not be treating expenditure on the fight against global climate warming as a priority .
at the same time we should also be aware of the chinese thirst and hunger for natural resources - their sort of resource - seeking motives .
( fr ) mr president , i voted in favour of mrs ries 's report on health concerns associated with electromagnetic fields .
let me tell you my personal view ; it is unacceptable .
there should be no distortion of competition among eu fishermen resulting from the different ability of member states to mobilise public or community funding . '
the olympic games are a good opportunity for such measures .
if we achieve a situation in which we have secure passports and data protection laws are respected , then the european union will have made a decisive step forwards in the interests of children and against child trafficking and child smuggling .
for this reason , a solution must be agreed by both states at the earliest opportunity .
at the same time , however , there will be a significant increase in the need for staff with vocational qualifications who can take up the vacancies on the labour market .

what mandate are you going to ask the heads of state or government for , and how are you going to ask them to divide up the portfolios ?
president - in - office of the council . - ( fr ) first of all , as mr higgins has indicated , the situation remains of great concern , and we understand what makes the solutions that have been proposed unacceptable at this time to the leaders of the opposition , but i believe that there is to be a tripartite meeting of the political organs of the sadc , that is of swaziland , angola and mozambique , in harare on 27 october next .
i also believe that we need to emphasise the importance of the technological factor as enormous progress has been made in this area in recent years , but that it is equally important not to neglect respect for individuals and their fundamental right to privacy .
there are numerous reasons for this , ranging from red tape , cumbersome regulations or regulations valid for too little time to information which is difficult to access and a lack of transparency .
this harks back to the speech made by the secretary - general of the united nations yesterday , to the effect that we must follow our future course within the united nations , through a root - and - branch reform of that institution and its governance .

to close , i should like once again to thank our irish friends and to send them my warmest and heartiest congratulations on their clearly european choice .

i am very disappointed the uk has decided to opt out from an improved reception conditions directive as that would bar automatic detention solely on the grounds of submission of an asylum claim , cut across uk fast - track detention and enforce the right to work after six months .
but in no way did i mean to offend the honourable member , whose record speaks for itself .
let us remember , in this respect , that the union is not doing anything new in this domain .
' moreover , the commission and the european parliament agree on the importance of close cooperation in monitoring the implementation of the eu - korea fta and the safeguard regulation .
i ask you to approve the recommendation and would like to express my thanks for the broad support i have received .

allegations have been made of fraudulent activity at that college , including the use of taxpayers ' money by staff to buy furniture for their personal use .
europe , too , is governed by democracy , and we are having democratic debates .
i will report orally to the european council in two weeks ' time about this issue , how the work is being done .
this issue must , therefore , be put back on the agenda , and we must go further with regard to supervision , banks ' equity capital , prohibition of certain financial products and the fight against tax havens .
ladies and gentlemen , in my opinion , it is clearly correct and natural to discuss issues relating to the use of european funds at a strategic level : there can be no doubt about that .
it is , above all , a question of language .
that is clear from the new breakout of hysteria following the attempted terrorist attack on the delta aircraft .
we must now demand a full public inquiry into the suspect data before we spend another penny on mitigation .
i firmly believe that , on the basis of the tasks , objectives , principles and instruments defined by all the treaties and the charter of fundamental rights , and furthermore based on the shared competences as well as the supporting , coordinating and complementary actions of the union , a very strong strategy on roma inclusion can come into existence .
the statistics reveal all this , which is why the eu has set itself the lofty aim of reducing the amount of waste to be disposed of by 20 % by 2010 .
if we do not allow debate then we are not taking ourselves seriously , and i do not think that is good either .
road infrastructure safety (

while invoking the un international covenant on civil and political rights , they neglect to say that at the same time , the same un general assembly voted in the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights , which they are quick to forget about .
finally , as the minister said , this policy can only be successful if it is accompanied by resources , political will , effective action and an absence of naivety , especially if the creation of new institutions is involved .
through these reports , it is , of course , asking for national actions to be coordinated and for the commission to use every means currently available to it in order to act .
agenda for the next sitting : see minutes
( ro ) through the committee on budgets , the parliament has made an extremely important decision .
we support this , but with dedicated rules , which there did used to be in the past .

however , this does not imply a preliminary decision concerning the proposed part - session from 20 to 23 april .

the economic crisis was used as a lever to force people to vote ' yes ' .
( es ) madam president , president van rompuy , president barroso - who is not here , but whom i am also addressing - the truth is that it has been very good to see you together and , in my opinion , this is because we have seen that there is a move towards and a focus on what should be the foundations of the common strategy in the next ten years and , in my view , this is extremely important .
i say this now with stronger conviction , in light of the recent case that took place these past few days , which saw the ship pinar save 154 immigrants found in international seas .

( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , our debate on neurodegenerative diseases permits me to introduce the problem of sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) and to bring to parliament 's knowledge the fact that 150 people throughout italy have begun a hunger strike as a show of support for salvatore usala , an als sufferer who has stopped eating in order to protest against the italian government 's indifference to the problems experienced by patients and their family members who are living with this terrible disease .

mr de castro referred to the measures that have already been taken .
for the moment , member states with external borders are carrying most of the burden and their situation is worsening by the day due to a lack of resources and capacity .
however , i would like to say this : what is needed to improve the situation in tibet is not so much a dialogue between the european union and the dalai lama , but more a dialogue between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama .
it cannot be the same towards all countries , because these countries have different degrees of democracy and are interested in implementing this policy in different ways .

in writing . - ( el ) the commission proposal for a directive and the related report by the european parliament on the imposition of sanctions against employers of illegally staying third - country nationals are a monument to hypocrisy and deceit .
when faced with cheap and inferior imports , the competitive advantage that quality should give is often not enough : hence the role that needs to be played by cap funding in keeping our producers competitive .
different charges in individual member states do not .
as president barroso stated in his ' state of the union ' speech , this is not a discussion about spending less or more ; this is about how to spend more intelligently .
in particular , i would like to highlight the border dispute between cyprus and turkey , which has still not been settled this year , and the illegal occupation of cyprus , which has not yet been brought to an end .

the republic of croatia is an important transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled from the production countries to consumer countries .

i am very pleased that he is supporting the proposal negotiated by the committee , because it really is a very good compromise between various standpoints : a compromise between the commission 's standpoint , on the one hand , and the opinions presented by the member states , and , on the other , it is compatible with investors ' interests , but most of all , it opens up good prospects for the union 's investment policy in the future , serving the union as a whole .
regarding agriculture , it is worth noting the extreme volatility of the dairy sector , highlighting the need for a permanent approach to address this issue , namely , through a fund for the dairy sector .
this is not a record that anyone will have access to : the data are collected only in case of need .
the proposed european donor card is inappropriate , as rules on consent , allocation and organisational structure differ from one member state to the next .
indeed , the business directory companies are often established in a different member state , making it difficult for the victims to seek protection or redress from national authorities .
a sum of eur 2.5 million has already been paid out without enough information .
i believe we all see it as our shared responsibility to ensure that european citizenship is seen not as a mere symbol but as a specific right to which substance can and must be given in day - to - day life .
this approach is based on cooperation , on mobilisation of the necessary resources and on a strategy learning from success as well as from failure .
the internal market is everywhere - it must be everywhere - but , mr harbour , the 2020 text is not designed to talk about everything .
debate on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law ( debate )
the motion addresses the issue of the failure to reach agreement at the wto and expresses a desire for renewed efforts to reach agreement .
furthermore , the community budget for the transport infrastructure is almost non - existent for the 2010-2013 period , even though the challenges and development needs are enormous : ensuring intermodality between different forms of transport , the development of high - speed railway lines to serve not only all the member states ' capitals but other large european cities as well , the development of rail freight corridors and the single european sky , along with the modernisation of ports and the development of maritime transport .
our goal is to help to produce the first principles and new joint international rules for an overhaul of the international financial system .
is the eu failing european workers in this regard too ?
we must , therefore , ask ourselves what the european union was set up for and why it is so important for us that this great project succeed .
they are all lining up against hungarians in transylvania , which is similar in size to kosovo and has a similar population to the albanian province .
you will not have to wait too long .
the present compromise addresses some of the existing inequalities .
it was completely wrong that for seven years the world 's largest trading entity and the poorest continent had not sat down together to talk .
he is not an easy person to deal with and abuse in eritrea is widespread .
a general seized power in violation of constitutional legality and placed the president , the prime minister , other members of the government and many civilians under arrest .
that is the course we are currently setting .
this office risks being a dangerous first step towards european competence for aspects of criminal law and the focus on its creation is a distraction from making existing systems and bodies work effectively .
it is surely a win - win situation - both dealing with our massive stockpiles of waste and providing an alternative energy supply source , particularly as we face an energy crisis and increasing dependence upon insecure foreign supplies of oil .
there was , incidentally , a speech made by the polish minister , who expressed his concern and his feeling that there was a need to react and to take a position regarding the systematic harassment of members of the polish minority .
the world bank , oxfam , undp and others have come up with estimates ranging between usd 10 billion and , i would say , usd 100 billion yearly .
could i ask if that aspect of independent living is being addressed by the study and , if not , would you undertake that a study of the availability of personal assistance and the generalisation of such a scheme across the european union could be addressed , and indeed the portability of it ?
in principle it is ready to do so but it takes a certain amount of time .
i support the commission 's proposal to mobilise the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egf ) , and hope that the redundant workers will be able to find new jobs as quickly as possible .
i would now like to say to the egyptian authorities that we need to ensure that people are not prevented in this way from coming to the defence of others .
refugees , asylum seekers , migrants and ethnic and religious minorities are all facing a worrying increase in violations of their universal fundamental rights .
rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , i am pleased that we are seriously trying to take care of the protection of consumer rights .
we are talking about the 700 mhz frequency band , which also has an extraordinary capacity for mobile telephony and its development .
this is in line with the current treaty provisions .
clearly defined payment deadlines will put a stop to these methods .
i will take this opportunity to announce that the commission also intends , in the context of the european elections , to run special activities in the framework of the debate europe plan d initiative .
that is why i believe that there is room for improvement here , so that we can be credible when we explain these issues to russia and the rest of the world .
it is important for us to devote so much space to countering exclusion and poverty among children , the elderly and the disabled , in other words those who are not in a position to avoid this situation .
we often do well when it comes to totting up points , something that the stability pact enables us to do , but when it comes to organising the best possible game , to optimising the potential offered by the single currency , we are often below par .
agreement between the ec and israel on certain aspects of air services (
therefore , the clear distinction between advertising and information called for by the rapporteur is important .
that will be self - defeating for us .
the us has announced and has already started the reworking of relations with russia .
( es ) madam president , mr barrot , it is no coincidence that a whole series of spanish meps have spoken .
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i regret the fact that this debate was put on the agenda at such short notice that the high representative for foreign affairs and security policy was not able to be here .
i fully endorse what mrs zimmer said : employability cannot be the sole objective of the esf .
nevertheless , for the peace and assurance of the citizens of neighbouring austria , the slovak republic agreed during eu accession talks to the early decommissioning of the v 1 and v 2 reactors at jaslovské bohunice , which were fitted out to the highest standards .
- before the vote :
i must say that i also thank mr atondo , and am bound to report that the afco committee on constitutional affairs - which i chair - has approved this document almost unanimously .
that would be bad enough , but the irish government has decided to blame europe for this decision , when of course it is entirely a matter for the irish government as to what policy it implements in relation to implementing the water directive .
there should be a separate approach to every single country .
this means in particular the right to paid maternity leave and to an earnings - based pension .
representatives of the minorities are entitled to seats in parliament , even if they have not obtained the necessary votes .
( the president cut off the speaker )
so , with this debate and with the vote , commission , parliament and council are filling a legal vacuum and enabling member states , from tomorrow , to better prosecute those who pollute our seas : another step taken by the european institutions to strengthen the rights and freedoms of the european people .
i should like to say that , as rapporteur , i fully support mrs de lange 's amendment which proposes limiting the transport of live animals to abattoirs for slaughter to nine hours .
i am talking about the wholesale and systematic gang rape that takes place in bangladesh .
having weighed up the issues , i abstained from voting .
( ro ) madam president , the european council took a significant step towards creating the european stability mechanism by adopting the decision to modify the treaty of the functioning of the european union .
we currently have a level of youth unemployment of 21 % , in other words , almost double the normal average .
the interventions have underlined that this concern remains as real and legitimate 50 years after the tibetan uprising of 10 march 1959 .
they are responsible for local service provision , economic development in the individual regions and security of supply .
unfortunately , the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament , the group of the greens / european free alliance , the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe and the confederal group of the european united left - nordic green left , for which i voted , and which expressed these concerns , could not be adopted , as it was just short of the number of votes required .
instead , we should continue addressing the violations of human rights and civil liberties as vigorously as ever .
that is why , mr president , we have considered the citizens ' initiative to be a priority .
i am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on protection structures for narrow - track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors .
the most recent example is the situation from july of last year , when trace amounts of genetically modified varieties were found in supplies of soya .
but there will be none of the growth which is needed without restored confidence in public finances .
here for the first time , and by working closely with all the parties involved , we are attempting to reach joint agreement on a long - term , stable framework for the development of one of europe 's key industries .
why is iran pressing ahead with uranium enrichment when it has no operational nuclear power stations or even plans to build them in the future ?
there is , though , one thing that i would like to say quite clearly : such progress is often to be achieved at expert level .
we have attained our goal in that member states must provide considerable information on pesticides and in a form that is mutually comparable .
we need to increase collection .
i believe that the report on the health check of the common agricultural policy is of special importance today , when the european parliament has to show to the citizens its commitment and responsible political attitude to the development of the agricultural sector in the community .
the interaction with the commission during the preparation of this report and the consensus reached on this report in the committee on foreign affairs have convinced me that europe is prepared to take on this challenge .
these are very positive proposals and i welcome them .
in writing . - ( sv ) the amendments tabled by the committee on the internal market and consumer protection are , unfortunately , of poor quality from a purely legislative perspective , and chapters ii , iv and v are superfluous .
the council has also decided on the establishment of the european alliance for families .
quite suddenly , the liberal group in the european parliament also held a seminar on this issue .
based on the assumption that the reasons for the rise in oil prices are of a structural nature and that such trend are likely to continue into the future , the union needs to find long term solutions .
now many citizens in many countries are suffering considerably as a result , and their energy supplies have been cut in the middle of a bitter winter .
security , well - being and equality are the result of consistent adherence to the rule of law , solidarity and non - discrimination in different areas of policy and when legislation is being drafted .
instead of what we might describe as a culture of subordination among clients , farmers and officials , we need a culture of cooperation .
the movement which we are witnessing is , in fact , a groundswell .
if , on the one hand , this choice of human resources policy offers greater flexibility , on the other , it will require increased training for european union staff .
ladies and gentlemen , the time is not yet ripe to call for a boycott ; the olympic games are still five months away . we must , however , state our opinion with absolute clarity , namely that we call upon the chinese authorities immediately to halt their power - crazed behaviour on the issue of tibet , which is jeopardising this great world sporting event .
so the next commission will have nine female members , one more than the current commission , and once again i want to thank all of you who have supported me in this difficult task of getting at least a reasonable - not an ideal , but a reasonable - number of women for the next commission .
bridging loans under this facility can , however , prevent bankruptcy and job losses , and that is also in our interest .
both parties would benefit from more in - depth relations , especially as there are numerous opportunities for cooperation in the fields of education , scientific research and renewable energies .
mr president , as a born anti - revolutionary i shall be speaking with rather less passion than mr cohn - bendit , but i understand now why 1968 was a success for him ; i could only follow events on television as a child .
one of the key solutions is better involving civil society that has a long tradition of organising social support .
( de ) mr president , i just wanted to ask mrs mccarthy whether the weapon she has with her is marked and registered and whether she has permission to bring it into the house .
if annual accounts are no longer compulsory and thus lost as a source of information , the only remaining possibility is to request the documents prepared for tax purposes .
we have an additional layer of protection by only allowing bone in meat to come from australia , canada , chile , new zealand and the united states .
the terms ' illegal production ' and ' consumer care ' have a very nice ring to them , but i would like to know why we do not show the same determination in protecting consumers against the consumption of imported eggs produced in conditions which do not meet the requirements introduced in the eu .
this is a tidal wave that we have to stop , and better passports alone will not solve this matter .
the time has now come to make this fund as flexible as possible and to mobilise it without delay .
i fully agree that the commission and the member states should adopt measures to combat abuses , particularly regarding activities of companies not really engaged in any genuine and effective business in the country where they are registered .
this agreement is a major step towards better air quality in europe .
i very much respect the opinions of people who are consistent in all of this : people who say , ' i do not think that is a particularly good idea ' , and follow it through by saying it here in parliament and when they go before the committee and stick with that position .
the members having had a look at this problem carefully will certainly be interested in this .
when i was there i also met mrs tadjibaeva , a political prisoner , who has now been released ; we hope that her health will improve and she can be given the proper care , but i was also able to see that a good benchmarking policy meant that progress could be achieved and that there was commitment from the authorities to meeting more fully the criteria defined by the european union .
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for completing a very demanding piece of work .
the citizens should also be actively involved in the coming elections to the european parliament .
since my time has run out , i will not be able to go into them in more detail , but please note that we expect the commission to act now as the spearhead for this revolution in current practices .
this surely cannot be a serious attempt to reform european works councils , since it makes no provision for more meetings or for sanction mechanisms in the event of infringements .
the guiding principle is that , to the extent that the situation returns to normal , keeping these measures in place for longer than required risks changing the behaviour of financial market participants in an undesirable manner , and we do not wish to breed dependency .
member of the commission . - mr president , i would like to thank mr méndez de vigo for an excellent report .
the commission has blocked the fisheries agreement with guinea because government actions there resulted in the death of 150 demonstrators .
i sympathise with that position .
that is why i supported amendment 24 .
also , if one looks at other key performance indicators , the employment optimism index has fallen by three points from + 4 to + 1 in the last nine months .
our focus should be on the important elements of the proposed treaty and the real obstacles in the internal market , not jeopardising emerging markets , inward investment and the future ratification of the treaty by working on an unwise , distrusted and thus unacceptable common tax - base proposal .
when we talk about information systems , however , we should not forget that these contain personal data , and that issues relating to the protection of such data and personal privacy are of paramount importance .
he told us that britain 's so - called ' red lines ' have been secured .
who has delivered this ?
regarding the urgency procedure , here we already had some clear examples in the past that there are issues as regards food safety or safety of toys , for instance , that sometimes call for a very urgent procedure and , therefore , we think that we have to find something even more urgent than the early approval proposition made by the rapporteur .
would you like me to tell you that if i am in favour of epas , of economic partnership agreements to create regional markets , then it is because i believe that to tackle the question of food security , economic partnership agreements are probably part of the solution , because until we have regional markets that are economically integrated , developing countries will not be able to benefit from globalisation ?
things were simpler before .
the report has been elaborated mainly on the basis of the following two documents : the communication from the commission to the european parliament , the council and the court of auditors entitled ' cohesion policy : strategic report 2010 on the implementation of the programmes 2007-2013 ' , and the commission staff working document accompanying the communication .
this is true not only for the highly developed economies here in europe , but also and in particular for the so - called developing countries .
it is unfortunate that the czech presidency began not as previously planned , but with the imposed resolution of the russian - ukrainian gas conflict , in the same way that the previous presidency had to begin by seeking an end to the russian - georgian war .
however , we need to wait for the indices , to be prepared by the commission , in order to finish planning the cross - border programme between hungary , romania , slovakia and ukraine , funded by enpa .
diplomacy without financial resources is merely a useless gesture .
i support the call to the commission to increase , within the framework of the forthcoming green paper on territorial cohesion , the funding needed to deal with regional problems .
( loud applause from the right )
for example the vca , which is the type approval authority in the uk , has recently stated that it will approve , after january 2011 , new types of vehicles fitted with existing - already approved to regulation ( ec ) no 706/2007 standards - macs containing ' f ' gases with a gwp greater than 150 .
madam president , [ opening words lost as microphone switched off ] ... a recast directive but quite a few of us here worked on the original cast , and it is a good opportunity to close some of the loopholes and put in place the directive we always thought merited our attention .
the parliament has kept to its earlier commitments regarding emission reductions by 2020 , and has now set out even more ambitious targets for 2050 in the light of new recommendations from the scientific community .
( fr ) madam president , commissioner , in the light of this text , allow me to express my satisfaction and to emphasise one requirement and one point on which we will need to be vigilant .
we have fulfilled our duty today .
it is vital that procedures such as this are introduced to help reduce the number of people at risk of poverty in the eu , in order to ensure that the eu 2020 goal of removing the risk for 20 million european citizens is met .
in my opinion , it is both balanced and ambitious .
despite this , i would simply like to confirm something that you will like .
a vision that , of course , takes more specifically into consideration the problems of poverty that we are still facing in our europe .
in adopting this resolution , the european parliament , the voice of european citizens and democracy , is sending a clear message to the chinese authorities : that eradicating and subjugating one culture to benefit another is an act that is not worthy of any truly great and modern country .
however , since i know that commissioner frattini has an interest in this matter , i will put the question to him : would it not be advisable to come up with a way of ensuring that these large international criminals who ruin the lives of thousands of families could also have their assets attached ?
let us now go further .
so there is much that can and should be done to promote biogas and , at the same time , make agriculture more sustainable .
( nl ) mr president , mr leterme , mrs győri , both you and your diplomatic service have proved that we can be successful , even in very difficult economic conditions , and that we can tackle those conditions in a way that makes europe stronger .
as an mep who has always paid particular attention to issues relating to crime prevention , security and police cooperation , i acknowledge the fundamental importance of europol in creating a secure european area and preventing crime throughout europe , along with the need for it to be reinforced at various levels , including those under discussion here .
saving energy and making rational use of it are further very important actions .
i think one of the problems we have here in the european union - and i think we do it out of the very best of intentions - is that if we need to do something , we immediately legislate .
it is a measure that will ensure greater transparency during the adoption of legislative acts , regulating methods of control by member states over the exercise of powers conferred on the commission .
it strengthens commercial measures against the illegal use of and illegal trade in substances that deplete the ozone layer in the european union and will help to prevent environmental dumping in developing countries .
the euro plus pact does , without a doubt , represent a step forward but much remains to be done .
the resolution emphasises that the economic partnership agreement must contribute to strengthening economic growth , regional integration , economic diversification and the alleviation of poverty .
this time , the conditions exist for having a reinforced system of governance in this strategy .
in fact , the priority in the region is to restart the peace talks which will involve , as has been the case so far , both the european union and the united states of america .
before the vote on amendment 35 :
the role of the eu is vitally important , as it has mechanisms and instruments at its disposal , such as the solidarity fund , the structural funds - the european regional development fund and the european social fund - and the cohesion fund , which need to be activated and applied in a quick , flexible and simplified manner .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
it remains to be seen whether a move to coordinate the good 200 bits in operation in the european union can finally resolve the problem whereby binding bit arbitration judgments based on international law entail commitments to investors by member states that give rise to eu treaty infringement proceedings .
the european parliament must send out a clear message that it places the defence of these values above short - term economic interests .
the complexity of european union financial regulations , moreover , often involves an enormous expenditure of time and money on red tape alone .
there are many areas of that country where even the authorities cannot exercise legitimate democratic power .
it would make the legal position clearer , allow the planning of necessary investments , and bring an end to the coexistence of two payment systems - national and european - which leads to needless expenditure .
today , our parliament is paying special attention to the current situation by adopting a resolution only on ashraf .
our reservations are based finally on the fact that , at a time when we wish to take europe down the road of a green economy , the text proposed to us deals neither with the energy performance of products nor with their partial harmfulness to users .
that report will provide an in - depth analysis of the situation of young people in europe and thereby help us to highlight their concerns .
it refers to the treaty of lisbon , which we have strenuously opposed , and also voices support for a permanent eu operational headquarters , backing for an eu ' white book ' on european defence , and unequivocal praise of the european defence agency .
torture is a daily occurrence in iranian prisons , but not only for uk nationals .
this freedom is essential .
for that reason , i would like to propose eleven approaches to a solution .
what is the problem ?
it is time for us to join forces to return everything to normal in this country that has been rocked by natural phenomena .
the report calls on member states to take measures aimed at the recognition of not just traditional forms of gainful employment but also of various other forms such as voluntary and domestic and family work , and to assess how they should be included in member states ' systems of national accounts , and to assess its impact on gdp .
since when has the european ertms standard been available ?
i should like to thank the commissioner and all colleagues who spoke in that debate .
in conclusion , we will be negotiating with the united states .
each institution must fulfil its responsibilities .
the passenger , as well as the bag , got on board without any problems and landed in ireland .
the hour at which europe must address the new human rights problems of european citizens has , unfortunately , arrived unannounced .
we have to formulate a joint strategy for member states and european union institutions that will ensure that the after - effects of the crisis will be dealt with , at the same time enabling the union and all its member states to be competitive in the global economic environment and to develop in an environmentally sustainable fashion so that all citizens of the union will promptly feel their standard of living rise even in the short term .
however , it is unclear whether we can counter the phenomenon of terrorism effectively in this way .
finally , i would like to stress that it should be a priority for the commission to present all legislative proposals needed to adapt the acquis to the provisions of articles 290 and 291 , including the acquis in policy areas which , pursuant to the lisbon treaty , are now subject to the codecision procedure .
in addition , i call upon the commission to give serious consideration to establishing a single information and reservation interface for all interconnected modes of transport .
these proposals provided for the creation of three new european supervisory authorities in the areas of insurance , securities and banking .
my services are doing their best to ensure that regulations or agreements on international trade take fully into account the contribution , but also the necessary constraints , of customs concepts and procedures .
european military engagement contributed to the prevention of a situation similar to the one in rwanda .
this is perhaps a long and slow process of contributing to the gradual realisation that , in russia too , things can be different , more normal , and people happier , since the country has that potential .
we are proceeding with that , but it needs a lot of work because the directive , as originally adopted , was not functional .
the audit opinion would be clean .
in order to prevent such bad habits , i have tabled an alternative resolution , which 40 members have signed to indicate their support .
however , this is tantamount to an accusation of deception , fraud , and unjust enrichment on my part .
now while i am not sure whether the term ' justification ' is adequate here - and personally i think that in french it would have been preferable to use the term ' praise ' or ' apologia ' for terrorism - and whether it would not have been better to change it , i will be interested to see how this house reacts tomorrow to this somewhat delicate point , which goes to the very heart of the debate , namely where to draw the line between security , fundamental rights and freedom of expression .
i voted in favour of this report , which was approved in this house on the day when we celebrate the centenary of the day dedicated to women .
in spite of the many shortcomings of the american democracy , they have achieved something that at this point we can only dream of : they have a black president .
( nl ) mr president , allow me to start with some words of criticism .
bulgaria suffered the most in terms of losses resulting from the recent gas war between russia and ukraine .
the striffler reports underlines some of these concerns and it is to be hoped that positive action results from today 's vote .
the report notes significant differences among them in terms of resources , technical expertise and stakeholder engagement in the standardisation process .
but under these proposals , all services are open , except those specifically excluded at the outset .
we are at an historic juncture when transatlantic cooperation has become vital with a view to jointly drawing up a new security strategy for the european union and the new strategic concept for nato .
i appreciate that the eu needs to allocate sufficient financial and human resources to its common foreign and security policy in order to achieve the concrete results which european citizens are expecting from us .
i can tell you , mme iotova , that the bulgarian market has 180 inspectors .
today the waste has reached the quirinale , where the dirty bolshevik napolitano has given the order to provide blandishments to prolong the death - agony of his drinking friends , without a care for democracy or for the people 's wish to vote for a new parliament .
it jeopardises people 's relationships , work and health and , in no time at all , they can accumulate thousands of euros in debt .
the political forces that created this political crisis by rejecting this austerity programme , tabled by the government and supported by the european commission , the council and the european central bank , can be very satisfied with this .
- madam president , the european parliament 's priority today has to be to get the largest majority possible for the commission proposal to extend and make permanent the option to lower vat rates on labour - intensive services .
particular focus should be directed towards the formulation of regulation which ensures greater spectrum efficiency , better frequency planning and safeguards against anti - competitive behaviour and the taking of anti - social measures with regards to the usage of the spectrum .
that , to my mind , is the core of both the rasmussen and the lehne reports : the need to establish european financial regulation .
thirdly - and probably most importantly - we now need , in particular , to tackle the crisis in confidence that we are seeing throughout the world and particularly here in europe .
i myself have tried , with the safer internet programme , to do something else in this respect .
in the europe 2020 strategy , the commission promised to concentrate on growth based on knowledge and innovation .
however , as things now stand , the chances must be against producing a directive at all during this parliamentary term .
taiwan could have been better pre - warned if the wmo provided it with timely information .
the aim of all that is to foster the sustainable , peaceful development of the peoples of the world .
violence is never acceptable and will not contribute to finding a lasting solution .
plans for the later years of the programme are less detailed at this stage .
i am pleased that the commissioner has listed nine out of the eighteen amendments .
it is being laid in the sea in order to prevent landowners from blocking the pipeline .
i refer in particular to the problems met when starting a business .
- ( fr ) mr president , achieving a lasting calm in gaza will be possible only if a multinational intervention force is deployed under un control .
author . - mr president , the so - called anti - homosexuality bill before the ugandan parliament provides for the punishment of homosexual acts by imprisonment for terms ranging from seven years to life , or even the death penalty .
following the election results in côte d'ivoire , president gbagbo - who had been democratically voted out - was not prepared to accept his removal from office .
at first glance i would say that parliament to some extent leads the way .
lastly , the commission is using the programme to finance many projects in sub - saharan africa addressing the prevention of illegal immigration , the promotion of legal migration , the link between migration and development and the promotion of refugee and asylum - seeker advocacy .
this powerful instrument that the treaty has placed at our disposal coincides with the worst economic situation that europe has seen since 1929 .
good progress has been made , and the texts have come along very well where the vast majority of points are concerned .
this unity in diversity will be the key to the growing importance of europe 's role in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , in conclusion , the european union is a huge historical achievement .
the cost of producing the milk is higher than the price for which it is sold .
it prohibits harassment , which is a form of discrimination , defined as unwanted conduct with the effect of ' violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating , hostile , degrading , humiliating or offensive environment ' .
it is not the ss who go into the camps , but the italian red cross , known throughout the world for its competence and sensitivity in helping the marginalised and persecuted all over the world .
the undermining of these settlements is currently raising questions for us about sincerity of intent .
the european commission and the european parliament should regain their strategic role and go for brave european solutions .
the aim is also to see to it that the fishing activities that are carried out by our fleets under a fisheries partnership agreement relate only to the surplus .
on the other hand , producers in those regions are known for their quality agricultural products and for their experience in the sustainable exploitation of forest and pastureland .
however , aside from the number of weeks , we are talking about the dismissal of a woman who has become a mother being considered to be an unfair dismissal , or paternity leave being granted for the benefit of a working mother 's health .
activities aimed at structural reform have been made the main instrument of development .
what we must do is defend and improve the rights and working conditions of road transport workers , by combating job insecurity , respecting rest periods - without any loss of pay - and ensuring compliance with the labour legislation or collective agreements existing in each member state .
eulex was also to take charge in three areas : customs , police and jurisdiction and crucially , there was to be no - and i mean no - ambiguous relationship between eulex on the one hand and unmik , the un organisation , on the other .
for three consecutive days in april , the international industry lost usd 400 million a day , threatening to blow efforts to restructure the financially weaker airlines in europe sky high .
it should be borne in mind , however , that they will result in higher production costs , thus causing european producers to become less competitive .
i firmly believe that , if parliament adopts this amendment , the council will incorporate this rule into the compromise .
this new dimension of european foreign policy is something that we should and , indeed , must follow up to make the world a freer , fairer and more social place in future .
we have to be prepared to give them something back in return .
the report that has been submitted to you forms part of the supervision package which , as you know , had already been adopted unanimously in the council .
15 .
indeed , only gmos that have been scientifically evaluated as safe for the environment and animal and human health are authorised to be placed on the market .
this is why a firmer stance is needed against all forms of trafficking .
the cost of accident prevention and safety is high , but let me stress unequivocally that good health is priceless .
we have to force china to accept its share of the responsibility for development policy , poverty reduction and sustainable growth .
i have seen this in this work .
it must play an essential part in developing the technology required for the attainment of that goal .
( fr ) mr president , amnesty international has set the tone of our debate in a statement issued today .
we recall that 54.4 % of voters stayed at home in the 2004 european parliament elections .
i propose that the commission should help the german authorities to enhance the traceability and control of the german procedures , and similar measures should be taken concerning the procedures in other member states .
my friends , today we can think of a larger neighbourhood , one that stretches from north of the baltic sea to south of the mediterranean , one that is shared by europe and the middle east .
when i hear other members of this house saying that people simply need to take out an additional private pension for their old age , i want to reply that many people can barely survive on what they earn , never mind paying for an additional private pension .
i will close with the words of my late countryman mr justice asprey : ' reform ?
it is a conflict between the countries which have heavy transit traffic , which , of course , want more flexibility to address problems with their infrastructure , and clearly want to share the burden for the use of infrastructure between taxpayers and all users - i stress all users : there cannot be any discrimination .

firstly , the strasbourg - kehl - appenweier and the munich - mühldorf - salzburg cross - border projects are also highly complex .
my colleague , mr cappato , and i have been calling for years for the introduction of a european standard and i would very much like to compliment the commissioner for the manner in which he has regulated this by flirting a little with the industry whilst also threatening it , saying to it , ' you come up with a solution or , if not , we will introduce binding legislation ' .
the poor cannot afford to pay for lobbyists in the european union .
human trafficking is the modern form of slavery and the second most lucrative activity for organised crime throughout the world .
they will do so indiscriminately , without any need for concern that interoperability may endanger safety .
the same criteria are applied when assessing the state aid , viability being the most prominent of them , and the german shipyards - let me take that example - were successfully restructured and turned into a viable business , while the commission considers that the restructuring plans presented by the polish authorities will not ensure long - term viability .
( fr ) in any case , i would like to say to the entire parliament that many of the criticisms that i have heard here today - even though most supported the commission 's general approach - have been addressed , if i have understood correctly , to specific governments or specific member states .
against the background of the safe use of products and technologies , it is intended to strengthen our european economy and simplify the associated administration .

the united states has lost significantly in terms of credibility in its fight for leadership in internet freedom .
above all , the people in camp ashraf are human beings whose human rights have to be respected , irrespective of the fate of the organisation itself or of its past .
i should like to take this opportunity , as you referred to the terrible economic situation and the possible failure in getting the european fisheries fund up to speed , to ask if a complete ban on fishing gear such as boat seines would come under the provision of compensation for fishermen who lose their job or if , in keeping with the regulation , the two - year derogation from the rules of the european fisheries fund could be extended in order to safeguard viable social conditions .
i hope the outcome will be a value - oriented europe of citizens of which we can be proud !
meps love voting for texts .
we have learnt from experience and common sense that the solution lies in the debtor country putting its house in order , with the creditors realising that the debt to be paid needs to be arranged to match the relevant country 's real ability to pay .
if mr kazemi is put to death , no one will really be able to shift the blame onto bureaucratic procedures , unless they resign themselves to the view that that is solely what europe is about : bureaucratic procedures , nation states which are so powerful that they cannot even manage to save a life .
as rapporteur for the legislation on the maximum residue level of veterinary medicines in food i would like to emphasise that the key to this critical relationship is the adequate availability of authorised veterinary medicines , particularly for what in europe we call minor use and minor species ( mums ) .
if we really do want , as an exceptional measure - such as the one , i apologise to mrs serracchiani , used in this case , namely that of discussing one country and not europe - to ascertain the truth about the health of democracy within our country , then we should ask the president of the republic , giorgio napolitano , respectfully as an institution , whether he feels that he is the president of a country in which pluralism of information is floundering , freedom is in a tailspin and the tide of democracy is going out .
ten member states have such agreements .
and these are usually members of the aristocracy or royalty .
the core of democracy is the ability to hold elections , obtain a new majority and then a new law .
developing countries suffer the effects of the crisis to a greater extent than others : they have less growth , fewer jobs , greater difficulty in obtaining external funding , larger debts and less official development aid .

explanations of vote
mr president , it is fortunate that mr hahn is the commissioner responsible .
so now we are in the situation that we lost the cap and we have a 15 % subsidy under the ets regime for new coal power stations , for example in germany , between 2013 and 2016 .
firstly parliament can bring both sides together to talk ; secondly we should stand behind the commission and the council and support their efforts ; and finally we should firmly support the egyptian track of negotiations , because that is the only track that can lead to a solution and to the ceasefire which we currently all hope for .
as for the commission , i am slightly disappointed with the reassessment it carried out after the convergence report was officially published .
hostile parents often refuse to respect the decisions of courts from other countries granting custody of the children to one of them and simply take justice into their own hands and carry off the children of former partners to their own countries , exploiting differences between the legal systems of individual member states to overcome valid court decisions .
at the same time , it creates a political and legal precedent by making the stability pact even more austere and lets the united states of america into the euro area through the back door .
however , well beyond this , i consider that it is a question of educating all our fellow citizens , who must not make healthcare workers or those workers that subsequently handle blunt objects take unnecessary risks .
recent events in the area to the east of the eu , which have been mentioned previously in the house , namely the gas crisis and the crisis in georgia , have demonstrated once again the need for a strategy capable of ensuring that the european union plays an active role in this geopolitical area .
so therefore , if we wish to achieve a happy life , there is no point in neglecting our inner values .
it must also be made clear to what extent innovations such as electric engines are actually covered .
i will limit myself to two comments which are somewhat more general and political .
these jobs often lack correct contracts and social benefits .
( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i had planned to speak once , but i will speak again after mr fava has spoken , of course .
the politics of the mediterranean and the international situation have helped to develop our institutional framework because the region has always been an arena for international challenges and problems .
we are not dealing with a normal type of service , we are dealing with a game that has serious implications in citizens ' lives .
i believe that our constituents have a right to know not only what we pay ourselves , but also the details of the allowances and benefits that we receive .
consequently , the european commission has adopted a pragmatic policy approach .

they do not have trained administrators .
the message was that aids is treatable but not curable .
personally i think that we need a floating threshold .
the birth certificate of a child guarantees the child his name and nationality as well as access to medical care , for example .
eu - wide justice and high legal standards are crucial for our citizens when they travel , work and set up businesses in other countries and when people have to try and explain themselves in a foreign language .
i welcome the adoption of this report , as it indicates that the eu is going to address the structural causes of problems resulting from migration flows through its foreign cooperation policy , without preconceptions of any kind .
that is why we abstained .
the next step we take to resolve the eu 's protein deficit should be to relax the regulations banning the feeding of animals with meat and bone meal .
however user - friendly the citizens ' initiative is , if it is overused it will become devalued .
the sba action plan and the european economic recovery plan propose ambitious measures in three key areas : first , loosening the supply of much - needed credit ; secondly , reducing the administrative burden ; and , thirdly , helping smes do business abroad .
from the customs and excise that you would collect from trade and perhaps from an extra 0.5 % vat contribution from the member states who would draw down this facility .
at the same time 1 % of the population owns more than 15 % of the available wealth in europe .
such arrogance , such tyranny : fitting , of course , because this constitution is all about transferring more and more national powers to brussels despots - those who are , indeed , too chicken for a referendum .
court of auditors special report no 8/2008 includes the finding that ' member states did not take their responsibility to implement effective control and sanction systems . as a consequence , the control system provides insufficient assurance on farmer compliance ' .
this will allow the european parliament to send a clear signal to the commission .
this report throws a little light on the social and environmental standards that we must be able to integrate into invitations to tender ; it also proposes recommendations to facilitate sme access to public procurement markets .
we must expect airlines to submit realistic plans so that airports have the opportunity to offer unused slots to other airlines .
as i have already said in my introductory remarks - and i agree with the chair 's remarks - what i mean by reaction in the short term is to fully implement the ecofin road map as soon as possible - and we are on track , mrs berès .
as the honourable member may imagine , the council is aware of the complexity of the situation and in particular of the urgent need to overcome the deadlock that we are currently encountering .
we are meeting the wishes of the many citizens who have asked us in countless letters and e-mails to take action in this area .
as draftsman of the committee 's opinion , i have personally been wholeheartedly committed to this matter .
more than 5 450 cases under the terrorist finance tracking programme have been passed to date to european governments , with over 100 new generated leads provided to european countries from january to september this year .
i leave you to find this out for yourselves , although it does seem that they were not far away .
they pointed out , extraordinarily , that in countries like tunisia , emigration is viewed as a crime .
it is irrelevant to the debate , just as it is irrelevant to the debate when mr langen says that chancellor merkel understood the european treaty .
henceforth this will be a single transformation .
lastly , i believe that solutions urgently need to be found to bring an end to the war in libya , and also to prepare a package of measures for rebuilding the country after the conflict has ended .
let me refer to the issue from the very beginning .
spain 's experience is like the bull in the corrida : proud and strong to start with , but bleeding to death in the sand by the end .
let me first make a personal comment .
combating violence ( daphne iii programme ) ( vote )
it must work across the borders of member states , so that victims will not have to start the entire judicial process required to obtain protection measures afresh if they move to another member state .
when the russian province of transcaucasia was divided up along ethnic lines in the 1920s the enclave of nagorno - karabakh , populated by armenians , was given to azerbaijan by way of a compromise , with a guarantee of regional armenian autonomy .
protocol 30 does not suspend the mandatory nature of the charter in respect of the uk , poland or the czech republic .
more functions , greater competitiveness , more sustainable growth , more jobs , more research and further integration cannot be achieved with less money , without a financial review , without an evaluation of existing disbursement of funds and without our own resources .
it is in areas like this that i believe it is good to see cooperation across european states .
are these possibilities being used by the member states ?
what are the sticking points ?
the questioner will be aware that in december 2007 i wrote to cesr and to esme for further advice as to what i should do in relation to certain areas .
in the meantime , the council 's work on the review of the transparency regulation will continue to be based on the proposal that the commission tabled before parliament in may 2008 .
we have high expectations of the presidency in that regard .
but for the citizens to become engaged in the debate , they must also be able to influence the future .
the commission and the member states should develop an effective communication policy on the single market act , based on a policy audit of its tangibility to citizens .
though the amendments voted through committee were not what he wanted - in fact he wanted no amendments - he nevertheless defended the committee position in the negotiations which led to this first - reading agreement .
neither is it the case that the presidency wishes to unnecessarily restrict insight or debate in any respect .
a balance between flexibility and security on the labour market supports the adaptability of the economy and thus contributes to sustainable , secure and fair pensions .
as top italian football coach giovanni trapattoni would probably put it , ' belts off , bottles empty , shoes off ! '
in writing . - ( pt ) we voted in favour of this report , which deals with the european commission proposal on the eu 's involvement in the research and development programme that various eu member states have decided to set up in the field of the new information technologies ( ict ) to help people as they get older and to enable them to act effectively .
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i have voted in favour of the report by mrs iacob - ridzi on the european job mobility action plan ( 2007-2010 ) .
we are asking the council to fulfil commitments made a long time ago by several successive presidencies .
when deciding what levers or measures to introduce , it is essential to consider the probability of achieving the desired result .
judge bruguière , the respected and recognised counter - terrorism expert , proved that the organiser of the flotilla , ihh , had maintained contact with al-qaeda .
as you know , this proved to be very effective during the 2008 uefa championship .
so , i wish you good luck , mr zapatero .
fifthly , i would like to turn to the biggest problem , namely heading 4 , grandly entitled ' eu as a global partner ' .
indeed , limiting to 250 kilometres the threshold for compensation in the event of a major problem means effectively excluding three countries of the european union .
the eu has established tough carbon emissions targets and it is now incumbent upon member states to follow through with real action , and not just words , to ensure burden sharing does not just end up as load shedding .
today we are coming to the end of yet another round of energy disputes between russia and europe , but we still have no systemic guarantee or political framework to avoid similar problems in future .
indeed , in order to ensure that this derogation , which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth , is of genuine benefit to local populations and does not harm the european fishery product processing and canning industries , it was vital to provide for an assessment of its impact as soon as possible and to allow for its suspension , where necessary .
so , i believe that the best way is for the budget to finance any agency , but if there is the possibility of supplementary funds being raised , it should be evaluated .
some said - and they had reasons for saying it - that dialogue was pointless and that the response to military agression should be a military one .
these are priorities , and they should remain as such , including in this difficult period .
the report highlights the achievements of the cohesion policy , which is essential to the successful implementation of the eu 2020 strategy as an instrument for eliminating the disparities between regions .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , when the european union is , at times , seen as over - keen on regulation and quite rightly criticised for this , this can be traced back , quite simply , to reports such as the one we are now discussing .
i do not have time to analyse and comment on the individual suggestions and facets of such a wide - ranging debate , rather , since i must sum up in the few seconds that remain of my speaking time , i will use two adjectives to encapsulate and bring together your thoughts and suggestions .
i do not think that they will .
firstly , we believe that the commission also needs to take account of the fact that there is so little knowledge about the european union in belarus and that a satellite tv station will not change that .
i think it was wonderful working together .
this directive has been a long time coming .
that is what our aim must be ; that is why i am calling for a debate on the social market economy in europe .
i voted in favour of the pack report on the bologna process and student mobility as i believe that high - quality , effective and innovative european higher education that is accessible to every european citizen is vital for the european union to continue to be competitive and successful in the face of the demands of globalisation .
we are also contemplating other fields where , with concrete measures , we may be able to strengthen the real integration of the countries of the western balkans and re - enforce their connections with the european union .
we have sustainability criteria concerning greenhouse gases .
furthermore , we need to abolish as a matter of urgency the expensive visas which prevent belarusian citizens from travelling to the european union , reduce the fee and negotiate a relaxation of the visa regime .
we really need to insist on an independent international inquiry into what happened , in order to understand all the background and to understand whether provocateurs actually instigated this violence - which has now been declared criminal - and not those who were actually only calling for democracy in belarus .
this own - initiative report we are submitting says two things .
focusing the work of the european parliament on my humble self borders on the pathetic .
the first , of course , is jobs .
i want to say here that this maritime package is going to usher in a decisive change in europe , one that will foster quality and transparency in the maritime sector .
i still do not understand them , but i live in hope that one day i will be able to see how these inverted tariffs apply to mummies and dried fish .
specifically , the relevant legal bases are article 65 ( a ) and the second indent of article 67(5 ) of the ec treaty .
today , together with the relatives of the victims , the citizens of italy and the whole country , it is the european parliament - showing its extraordinary unity with a joint motion for a resolution - that is forcefully asking another country , which is a friend of europe and a friend of italy , for the immediate extradition of cesare battisti , who is a criminal and a terrorist and who has been convicted with definitive judgments , so as to finally bring to an end this difficult and painful episode that has been dragging on for too long .
as mentioned in the report , the school system has a fundamental role to play in developing children 's critical faculties with regard to images and the media in general , in order to prevent the disastrous effects of the recurrence of gender stereotypes in marketing and advertising .
my fellow members have already mentioned how important the fight against corruption is in the accession of a western balkans country , but there are two other key areas .
one member state has said ' no ' , we are listening and indeed we have to listen .
slovakia 's drift towards a deformation of democracy and the legal state is also evidenced by the fact that the president of the supreme court and the president of the judicial council have twice been prevented from speaking in a plenary of the national council during debates on laws concerning the judiciary , including a law on the judicial council .
actions of this type are included in certain national indicative programmes but , more importantly , there are also thematic programmes that complement geographically - based cooperation .
the same applies to alcohol awareness .
however , the majority of scientists may be right ; the majority of politicians may be right .
there is no justification for showing such respect .
i am in favour of a european patent system , but , on reflection , and for reasons of language , i abstained from voting on the present report .
by offering state guarantees they are laughing in the faces of taxpayers and the much vaunted small and medium - sized enterprises .
it was adopted in this chamber by 437 votes to 162 , with 33 abstentions , and has emerged as a specific measure of the european year for combating poverty and social exclusion .
their behaviour has been shameless .
the european parliament is therefore endeavouring to rise to this challenge , and attempting to create a suitable mechanism for the purpose and promote contacts of this nature between the european union 's institutions and its citizens .
it is because of all that that i believe that we simply have to be aware that we still need many years of major oil consumption but that we must nevertheless be fully ambitious as we walk the path away from oil : 20 % renewable energy sources in 10 years ' time .
indeed , i believe that the union 's foreign policy is worthy of attention .
and we have highlighted the role that local authorities have to play within this - and indeed the need for more of a framework around services of general interest - so that we can ensure that people are getting the services that they need .
after cucumbers , tomatoes , lettuce and bean sprouts , what will be the next victim of this health hysteria ?
subject : the state of play in the wto talks
the israeli government talks of more than 1 000 migrants trying to enter their country without papers each month and has started to increase security and monitoring along the border .
one of the things that we ask from the committee on the internal market and consumer protection is for this parliament to take an initiative in getting other national parliamentarians together in this house to talk in the framework of cars 21 about how they , as national and local politicians , are going to contribute to these overall goals of achieving a competitive car industry with the highest possible technology and preserving and developing jobs and employment , while achieving the goals that we all want to meet in terms of science , safety and environmental improvements .
the proposal also holds a great risk that soon it will not be the patient who has the right to seek treatment abroad , but rather insurers or member states who will be able to compel patients to go to the cheapest provider .
neither the uprisings in east berlin in 1953 and in poland and hungary in 1956 , nor the prague spring of 1968 , succeeded in seriously shaking the foundations of communist rule .
( de ) mr president , we have no objection to this topic being placed on the agenda .
it is a problem not just of the future but of the present .
certain member states have already introduced alert mechanisms that enable all public authorities and civil society to be mobilised in a very short space of time in order to search for and find the victim .
i feel it important to emphasise how much our contribution was fundamental in ensuring that the two partnerships to be launched after the pilot initiative on healthy ageing will both address ' smart cities ' , so that a number of futuristic experiments can be held in various european cities in order to reach the 20/20/20 objectives and for the purpose of realising the non - energy raw materials strategy , since we need to provide a concrete response to the great and difficult problems that affect society in this field .
we have significantly strengthened the obligations to provide information to our citizens , the consumers .
we must continue to assist member states to work towards common goals and shared approaches .
on the other hand , europe has been inundated with cheap goods from the far east , the manufacture of which has , in many cases , involved the exploitation of workers .
this is particularly important at the moment when there are internal challenges from and fears among our citizens about illegal immigration , which may threaten security and social advantages in europe .
the objective is to ensure that the use of pesticides is compatible with environmental conservation and with health protection and we must of course take account of the impact of the package on pest resistance .
madam president , i congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work and support her position on getting a fairer deal for consumers .
this report , though , contains many recommendations that run counter to the most elementary principles of the rule of law .
we do not want to punish the people of iran .
it is for that reason that we need to press ahead and for that reason that i share the stance of so many members who have today stressed the importance of intelligent instruments and intelligent cars , although we have to ensure beforehand that man is intelligent because the first responsibility lies with citizens at the wheel who have to be aware that there are other citizens whose lives depend on their actions .
why do we finally have to get our house in order ?
we then soon saw that to some extent , it was possible for the provisions to be applied in different ways - not just in austria , but also in some other member states , including my own country .
i therefore thank the irish people , since the will they have shown gives us hope for a stronger , more prosperous europe that is more unified and enlarged , while giving all european institutions the duty and obligation to act in such a way as not to betray this will .
the report on the green paper on the reform of the common fisheries policy , which we adopted today , revises the economic , social and environmental aspects of this policy , with the aim of redefining the approach to resolving the remaining problems within the sector .
i agree with all those members who have asked the banks to do more . i do not agree with the person who told the banks to do less or to be more prudent at this difficult time .
on behalf of the uen group . - ( pl ) mr president , implementation of the lisbon agenda as regards the increase in the number of high - quality jobs requires certain tools .
this is the only way in which it will be possible to create a fairer and more equitable and sustainable tax system , combat evasion , and , as a result , promote a better international fiscal environment .
strengthening the position of the union is closely connected with strengthening cooperation in the area of the current third pillar .
the commission has in fact initiated infringement procedures in the past year against 22 member states that have not implemented the european regulations properly , including italy , mr agnoletto .
having said this , while i respect the delicate nature of some of the issues addressed by our proposals , i believe the commission 's text has been diluted a bit too much .
mr topolánek , i would like to see another presidency by a new member state succeed .
we know that many products made in china are dangerous , but it does not just concern toys , it also concerns textiles and now vehicles .
in writing . - i welcome the proposals to cut bureaucracy in the decision - making process for the europe for citizens programme .
political strengthening is not being followed by the appropriate financial strengthening .
this has been discussed for a long time and the growers ' impatience has pretty much been fuelled by the question of when it will finally be over .
tax policy is the oxygen that small and medium - sized european businesses need for a resurgence which must not stop at the initial incentive , but which will see them through consolidation and growth .
for example in my own region of stará ľubovňa in the north east of slovakia you will find slovak , german , ruthene , goral and roma cultures .
you have , indeed , already spoken on this matter , but mainly on how the fund ought to secure its funding and over how long a period .
it is not enough to look each other straight in the eye and say ' we promise to obey all the rules ' .
( sv ) madam president , as the basis for cooperation within the eu the member states have signed several treaties laying down the basic rules governing what the eu is and what the eu must do .
so the real questions , and the real debate about the issues which you opened today , will come when we discuss the strategy for the energy technology plan - how to approach this , how to act in the future , and how to find the right answers .
secondly , having established the facts , we need an education programme for young people , parents and educators , and , thirdly , legislation which will apply to all countries .
the european union has exclusive competence with respect to external aviation which was traditionally governed by bilateral air services agreements between member states and third countries .
i suspect that mr sarkozy would describe himself , following this experience of the financial crisis , as a keynesian .
since we are talking about specific priorities and areas , i shall conclude by specifically mentioning one such area - nanotechnologies - in which i believe more investment is needed , given the many sectors in which they can potentially be used : medicine , agri - food production , electronics , new materials and new energies .
( el ) mr president , the g 20 summit in november did not , in my opinion , have substantial results .
the council has still not pronounced the slightest condemnation of the world 's current largest human rights crisis , darfur .
given the generally positive content of the resolution , i will vote for it , but not without registering my profound disagreement with this interpretation of what the education system should be .
it does not occur to it - and one wonders how it could - to admit the failings of current migration policies or the lack of application of european directives , in this case directive 2004/38 / ec .
this situation needs to change , whether for environmental or public health reasons , due to the high levels of pollution associated with it , or for energy reasons related to the dwindling oil reserves and growing difficulty of access to this commodity .
for this reason , i have identified this as one of the key priorities for inclusion in the correia de campos report on the single market act for europeans , for which i am shadow rapporteur .
you cannot impose additional monetary penalties on a country that is already heavily in debt .
the creation of a single working document represents significant progress in the control and regulation of migration flows from member states and will enable legal immigration to be monitored more easily .
i welcome the president - in - office 's response and i am very pleased that the council took the decision to arrange for the transmission of these proceedings in advance of any provisions that may be found in the reform treaty .
ageing and the consequent reduction of the active population undermine the sustainability of social security systems and economic growth itself .
we need further opening of trade .
finally , i believe it is vital to have a clearer definition of the data protection that will cover european citizens .
i request the commission and the council to ...
why , then , are we presenting overlapping legislation , entailing yet more burdens , particularly for member states that already have a well - functioning soil policy ?
it is irresponsible to expect european taxpayers to pay for these losses .
indeed , our asian partners also have a role to play in putting pressure on the regime in rangoon .
women cope better with , for example , micro - enterprises , but their participation in the management of large companies is quite small .
in writing . - ( de ) i have voted against the bendtsen report , because the figures have once again been changed and the targets are restrictive .
we welcome its commitment to a shared belief that market principles , open trade and investment regimes and effectively regulated financial markets foster the dynamism , innovation and entrepreneurship that is essential for economic growth , employment and the fight against poverty .
we would rather only admissible petitions came our way and we need to work very hard with citizens so that they know what we can and cannot deal with .
( ga ) mr president , when we speak of agriculture we speak of food .
the situation in these next few weeks will therefore be very tense in tunisia .
what action ?
in the uk , peat land is regarded as precious habitat to be protected .
crews should have the right to be treated fairly with due consideration for their safety .
secondly , a great merit of our work is that cooperation will improve , both among communications officials and between them and frontex .
these people and their nations have a legitimate requirement to exploit the resources and the opportunities found in the area .
the commission may , however , assess the constitution - as it may any other legal act of a member state - from the perspective of its compliance with union law .
i can only welcome the fact that president yanukovych and the new parliament have confirmed their aspirations to join europe , because a genuinely independent and democratic ukraine , free of corruption and a fear of power structures and oligarchs , and a ukraine which is firmly based on the rule of law is , and will be , an irreplaceable factor of stability for the whole continent .
the commission 's communication is welcome , despite the delayed action , and the commission now intends to act quickly , with certain aspects to be included in a new technical measure regulation in 2008 .
we need to ensure that budget deficits are reduced , in confidence and in good order , at the same time as we are reforming in order to open ourselves up for more economic growth - opening up european borders and opening up for more competition .
it is high time that their wealth of experience , creativity and resilience was available to our economy .
annex i of this report is the best proof of this , as it lists all the situations in which there have been human rights violations that we in europe have denounced or have not shirked from condemning ; from afghanistan to somalia , from russia to iran .
support is also just as important for private youth initiatives , which can lead to job creation and , by extension , social integration .
today energy is almost synonymous with foreign policy and tends to relegate even climate change to a secondary position .
here we should also bear in mind the competences of the member states .
i just want to ask the question as to why you decided to ask five questions from one commissioner and only one question from another .
let us learn from the lesson of what happened in the referenda in france , the netherlands and ireland .
all in all , i would like to thank the court of auditors very much for this report .
carbon trading aims to commercialise the earth 's capacity to recycle carbon and , thus , to regulate the climate .
i have the impression that in the debate on pnr , those who support pnr data transfer are , paradoxically , in the opposing camp , because they do not like the way the council treats parliament .
it is very important that equality can be implemented in parliament 's various roles , be they committees or delegations .
now , as then , we are honoured and grateful to be by your side in the struggles yet to come .
i am thinking here of the important role that asean and asean + 3 can play in further integrating myanmar into the region .
the meps took a stand , in strasbourg , so as to strengthen producers ' organisations , to stop speculation on the international markets and to control the influence of businesses in the processing and distribution sectors .
it is important that the high cost of electric vehicles - caused mostly by the cost of batteries - decreases , which requires research and innovation .
needless to say , these increase competitiveness and promote the security of energy supply , and also serve sustainability at lower costs .
in writing . - ( pt ) as the report states , the 1999 tampere european council endorsed the principle of mutual recognition as ' the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters within the union ' .

statement by the president

i doubt that these provisions , and more broadly those in the energy and climate package , will encourage the european economy to make the necessary changes and put the european union on the road towards a society that is abstemious in terms of carbon .

the european union 's competence is constantly being questioned , but europe should and indeed must be the motive force for development .
i find it very unfortunate that my colleague , mr lagendijk , is attacked when he says openly and honestly where mistakes have been made and when he also asks for cooperation by all political parties in the reform process .

mr president , ladies and gentlemen , today we are discussing further cases involving the release of funding from the european globalisation adjustment fund .
it particularly appeals to me personally that we should focus support on those who use environmentally - friendly means of transport such as trains and buses , for they too are suffering from the high oil prices and , compared with the airlines , sometimes have to cope with all kinds of different taxes , which in my country also means having to pay an ecotax .

however , i do not wish to overlook the importance of promoting such concepts .
i hope that this report will open the eyes of the member states - including those of hungarian politicians - and provide a boost to the current legislative debate on combating smoking .

the court of justice of the european union plays an essential role in this area , and this is why the committee on legal affairs has proposed a series of amendments intended to restore means provided in the initial draft budget , which will barely allow the court to meet just its most fundamental needs .

i think , however , and this is something that the group of the greens / european free alliance has always called for , that we should have better regulation on the issue of conflicts of interest , given that this parliament , as a co - legislator , will in the future need to be and increasingly today needs to be transparent and correct : not only transparent , that is to say , but also correct , with regard to its members ' conflicts of interest .

i have visited women 's shelters .
it is not turkey that i am opposing by voting against this progress report .

hungarians then fought shoulder to shoulder with poles , serbs , croatians , swabians , germans , austrians , armenians and romanians for their freedom and for world freedom against the two largest armies of europe at the time .

i want to raise one issue concerning article 17 in the proposed convention , which is about the role of agencies .
we must stand by what was promised in the 2007 budget , and indeed i think the commission is doing so .
the risk of possible abuse - i refer here to ' medical tourism ' - must not constitute a barrier in this case , but naturally , we must do everything within our power to reduce it to a minimum .

i believe the european social fund needs specific and simple rules .
i deeply regret that there is nobody present from the council , because it is the member states who are failing to do their job in this area .

when it comes to the programmes meeting their targets , i must remind you of the fifth cohesion report and the budget review , in which it was made clear that the performance of the programmes must be given more attention .
this was , indeed , exemplary cooperation , and i think we both made a contribution to very important advances in the new treaty , namely the issues of citizenship .
therefore , mr schmitt 's report , which aims to encourage the member states and all of us to rethink the role of sport in education , is very important .
tunisia also remains in ferment , and the longer that lasts the greater the danger that islamists will seize the political initiative .

transatlantic economic council ( vote )
in writing . - ( fr ) since the introduction of nanoparticles in cosmetic products , as well as the fact that the cosmetics sector features among the biggest victims of industrial counterfeiting , it is important to have clear means of control , particularly for identifying counterfeit cosmetics , which do not therefore meet legal requirements .
i believe that cities have every opportunity to lead the way towards a sustainable energy future .
we will commit funds to save knowledge throughout ipr policies .
in december 2006 the european parliament and the council adopted an important decision on the seventh framework programme of the european community for research , technological development and demonstration activities ( 2007-2013 ) .

i accepted - unlike some in this chamber - that these were difficult and sensitive issues .
during negotiations the cariforum states have already ensured that all of the obligations arising from the epas would be fully compatible with the regional obligations adopted by the caribbean states within the framework of their relevant regional integration programmes .

these countries will eventually be full members of the eu anyway , with full legal access to the eu .
mr president , i abstained on this report for two reasons , even though i fully agree with the title ' multilingualism : an asset for europe and a shared commitment ' .
the second thing , and this is even more important for me , is , of course , to ensure transparency for passengers - who pays how much for what - and that is unequivocally a duty for the airports as well as the airlines .
i would probably not be standing here today if we did not have effective antibiotics .
the hospitals are treating those injured in the daily violence that has characterised the hamas violent takeover of gaza and the defeat of secular fatah .
mr deva referred to the debris that has not yet been cleared so that the damage can be restored .
at this time of crisis , the people cannot resign themselves to a europe which has no answer , to a europe which is powerless to tackle the problems that they are facing .
indeed , the plans require even more public money to be pumped in in future , including money for the day - to - day operating aid .
the question of transparency between regulators - particularly on access to information on these practices - should also be raised in the g 20 and in other fora and bilaterally .
i hope that the document we have been considering will help to eliminate these irregularities throughout the european union .
i should like to mention that it is appropriate to remember that before the persecution of christians we had the persecution , for example , of the jews , and we had and still have persecution of the yazidis , the mandians and the muslims themselves , whether shiite or sunni , in iraq .
the commitment i am making is to continue to work with members of this house and with its committee on transport and tourism to ensure that the democratic institution representing european citizens can play an increasingly influential role .
i believe that , following copenhagen , we will have to acknowledge the need to adopt laws with extraterritorial aspects so that we are not confronted with a situation in which , on the one hand , we are financing the adaptation to climate change and the mitigation of that phenomenon and , on the other , economic operators are having an opposite effect in developing countries .
mrs merkel and mr sarkozy are likely to be able to force their proposals through , despite opposition from other countries in the euro area .

we were very proud of the results , because the great success was that after 24 years the military was handing over power to the people .
unfortunately the french presidency is unwilling to come to these meetings .
many people have pushed the commission to alleviate the very tight dairy situation .
in this regard , i have agreed with the conclusions that have been reached by our rapporteur and have thus voted in favour of the report .
in that case , they must have some knowledge of his whereabouts !
i believe that we really are at the start of something new .
in the volcanic storm which hit europe , the union was slow to foresee , slow to react to and slow to prevent the spread of the problems for european citizens .
as the situation is such that the 2 % threshold cannot be reached , i would like to ask whether the commission or the court of auditors has thought about whether the 2 % figure should be reviewed , so that year after year , we do not have to say that there is no way we will achieve the threshold this year and we will not do so next year either .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , the council common position is , of course , not ideal but i am well aware that it has taken many years of negotiations by member states to actually get this far .
does assimilation mean that immigrants should absorb and be absorbed into european civilisation , or does it mean that they should join the descendants of old european nations to create some sort of new european man ?
education plays a vital role here .
maritime workers belong to a category which carries out its activities in extremely difficult , often even dangerous conditions .
in september we disbursed allowances to 35 000 poor families in the west bank and gaza .
its renewal therefore confirms this success and we hope that it will continue to do so in the future .
is there a guarantee of this being successful ?
i think it is important to discuss that at the european council at the end of this week .
it is also not a problem of terrorism , but has much more to do with regional development and with balancing regional development across the towns and the countryside .
mr president , we are with the people of yemen , syria and bahrain in their aspirations to freedom and democracy , and in the bloody repression of the demonstrations and popular protests .
this is clearly the most important priority , but it is again the duty of border guards in the member states to seize illegal cigarettes .
what a change in comparison to the era when europe was scattered with border posts where checks - nit - picking ones at times - were the norm , not to mention the impossibility for citizens in the east to cross the iron curtain without risking their lives !

the debate is closed .
i have supported the aim of eu membership for the western balkan countries for the last decade , including when i was the vice - chair of the balkans delegation .
commissioner , are there also to be increases in appropriations for the next financial perspective ; is there a system of funding in place that will ensure that these schools can continue to function ?
we in the eu are also prepared to provide prompt financing for immediate measures in the period up to 2012 , as a way of increasing trust between north and south in the climate negotiations .
mr barroso , just imagine you were to stand for election in europe , just you and no other candidate .
it is estimated that eur 100 billion of this total investment need will be delivered on time by the market alone , whereas the other eur 100 billion will require public action on permitting and leveraging the necessary private capital .
i believe that it could generate increased trade within the internal market if we could be certain that the clothes sizes specified are the same irrespective of the country in which the clothes are bought .
this gives a ratio of 300 to 1 .
the commission proposal that we are debating merits our approval , all the more so as we must now , as in the past , find yet another way of easily disposing of our surpluses .
vice - president of the commission . - ( fr ) mr president , mr evans , first i wish to thank you on behalf of neelie kroes and the entire commission .
the european union continues to support international efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the conflicts in abkhazia and south ossetia .

as the poet said : hey lumberjack , stop a moment .
agenda : see minutes
the issue of the election outcome in iran is of central importance .
this is because only then can these people actually be made responsible , only then can it be guaranteed that the existing ground rules , too , will ultimately be stuck to .
i appeal to you , president of the commission , to make a comprehensive , new recovery effort .
it leaves me nothing more than to say that it is an excellent report .
furthermore , i welcome the commission 's decision regarding a ' stress test ' on oil drillings in eu waters .

i voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution .
the media might benefit from such business , probably by disseminating such promotion to minors .
that would be one of the ultimate tests for all of us .

in this regard , do not forget that both animals and people are mammals .

( it ) madam president , baroness ashton , ladies and gentlemen , the new strategic concept developed by nato contains important , positive changes to meet the challenges of the 21st century in a manner consistent with the values of the atlantic pact .
the role of external ratings as hard triggers is particularly significant when downgrading from investment grade to sub investment grade .
i strongly emphasised the point that anchoring inflation expectations is absolutely decisive , because it permits us to continue to have , in the medium - and long - term market rates , the incorporation of these inflation expectations over the medium and long run .
today it is also obvious that the transitional federal government in somalia does not have the resources or the means to establish peace and security in the country and therefore is much less capable of guaranteeing safety in its waters or in areas close to them , therefore international support is needed to do this , in line with what was laid down by the united nations in june , as the previous speakers said .
( ro ) let me begin by congratulating the rapporteur for tackling this issue of agricultural product quality .
it is this societal model that we in the political centre right want to continue to build .
this is almost without precedent .
first of all , probably because , with our 14 % co 2 emissions , we are not among the largest emitters .
a number of sociologists have been arguing , most recently , that this is not the best indicator as it does not consider aspects such as sustainability or social integration .
as a result , cooperation is not easy but we must take advantage of the interest which central asian countries have in the european union .
where there is a failure of market mechanisms , the regulation of final retail prices should be the instrument of last resort , as in the case of the roaming regulation .
- before the vote on paragraph 161

the european commission must act as a driver in the reconstruction process so that haiti finally emerges from this chaos .
i think - and this is just my personal point of view - greece was the cradle of european civilisation .
oral explanations of vote
this is , to a large extent , attributable to the differences in prosperity and to the level of salaries , differences that can lead to more labour migration from poorer to richer member states .
so i would like to thank you for the work that has been done on this dossier .
it is immensely important that we always take account of the gender issue in the negotiation of international trade agreements .
the underlying problem is that these two ports have no body to coordinate and monitor maritime traffic .
your question rightly highlights the central role of the european union 's instruments and policies and the importance of strengthening cooperation between all the key actors - member states , institutions at european level , international organisations and civil society .
thus , the commission intends to draft a charter of the rights of victims of terrorism .
consumers would benefit from more choice and lower prices .
it is a tangible example of the good thing that the eu could bring to its peoples .
i ask again , commissioner ; while everyone knows that most of these procurements were cofinanced works , only your services - and unfortunately your reply confirms as much - pretend that they do not know this , taking refuge in my view in arbitrary terms of community provisions .
if we return to this chamber ten more times to achieve that , then we should do that and keep doing it .
this is why we have not defined a one - size - fits - all plan , but a coordinated plan , based on the instruments already at our disposal in europe , the stability and growth pact and the lisbon strategy for growth and jobs , but by defining the common aims to be pursued in a coordinated fashion for economic recovery .
finally , we need to acknowledge that water scarcity and droughts have direct effects on social , economic and territorial cohesion , as the impact is more pronounced in certain regions , leading to land abandonment , forest fires and soil degradation , and hindering significantly the development of those regions .
can you witness , with a clear conscience , the staggering increase in unemployment figures which have now reached millions in the european union , and the shameless rewards again being paid out by the financial sector to those who have not only plunged us into the worst crisis imaginable , but also threatened us with poverty ?
most of these funds came from the chinese diaspora living in different parts of the world .
the region of the south caucasus , in particular , is characterised by a series of conflicts , the final solution of which is judged even by experts to be extremely difficult in some cases .
one measure i suggest should be considered is the establishment of a pan - european - or even better , international - public list of offenders convicted of sexual offences against children .
national information campaigns for foreign employees are a way to improve workers ' awareness of the rules of employment in each country .
i imagine that that might very well be the case , but independent testing is crucial here , too .
i am not 100 % sure that we will ever achieve them , especially on the renewables side , but nevertheless it is a good aim .
it is estimated that for every euro a large enterprise spends for one worker on account of regulatory duties , a small enterprise might have to spend up to eur 10 .
i proposed numerous amendments to the draft report , one area of which was the resolution of certain pending issues related to the free movement of employees .
coming back to turkey , the reform process is to continue and the european union should continue to encourage the process and progress .
the commission has consistently been calling for the interests of social services and vulnerable groups to be taken into account .
will the models , the norwegian model to which you referred , be an inspiration in terms of a guideline ?
secondly , only timely actions can be effective .
i would be very grateful if you could turn your attention to these issues .
madam president , at the request of the council and responding to the expectations of parliament , the commission has prepared and revealed today a document on the eastern partnership which will be presented to the summit , as stated by minister jouyet , president - in - office .
( applause )
on the other hand , it encourages sustainable development through the adoption of eu standards .
europol 's current legal framework , an international convention , moreover impedes any process of updating or modifying powers , with delays of years .
they keep asking for more and more , while parliament and the commission should just be marking time or even cutting their spending .
if we are encouraging our smes to compete within the single market , we must at least be able to guarantee their protection against these appalling scams .
information about quality and standards of care in other member states is another important factor for those of us who may need to travel abroad for treatment .
and all of this is cofinanced in the name of universality .
in copenhagen , we looked back and we stood alone in our ambitions .
i would like to ask the commissioner whether , as part of the investigation carried out by the commission , any differences have been noted between states where pharmacies are a restricted , monitored trade and the others , with regard to the counterfeiting of medicines and inferior quality .
this can , however , not apply to spare parts which have to be identical in design to the original parts if they are to serve a purpose .
more recently , we have focused on reducing car emissions in order to combat air pollution and climate change .
in europe and the european union we have to become better at conformity , but it makes no sense to develop specific labelling as a reward for the fact that we have been complying with the existing laws for a long time .
our actions foster the growth of radical , anti - western islamic beliefs .
- before the vote :
europe needs secure , clean energy just as much as it needs a research and development policy and a policy for promoting industrial innovation .
in this report the european parliament has set out its position on reforming and financing the common agricultural policy after 2013 .
the two proposed directives are the first in a series announced by the commission in 2005 in its action plan on legal migration .
forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see minutes
we are still interested and the invitation still stands .
since 2000 , none of the measures to combat unemployment , poverty and exclusion have achieved anything .
as long as we do not set priorities , we shall never allocate money wisely .
we have spoken to ms bozkurt about this code of conduct .
in all these areas , europe and the member states must commit themselves , so that the erasmus programme , which is one of the eu 's greatest successes , becomes a success for everyone .
written explanations of vote
ordinary people are literally running after the money as the prizes are getting higher .
1 .
it is nothing short of regrettable when a special report by the ombudsman is required in order to make public something as simple as access to documents to which eu citizens have a right .
hungary and the new member states therefore consider the formulation of these policies , the legal harmonisation of the internal market , and the elimination of the bottleneck in infrastructure and energy security , extremely important .
the eu member states have different social systems .
with regard to the discussion on european economic governance and the european monetary fund , too , we cannot simply act as if it is possible to continue with this strategy in this way .
obviously , data protection legislation has to be respected here , but there must be a limit : we cannot hide behind data protection in cases of terrorism .
i hope that commissioner michel will provide an answer to the questions ' where do we go from here ? ' and ' how do we move forward ? '
that is normal ; we should not be frightened , ladies and gentlemen , to speak at european level of politics with a capital p , and we have to be honest with ourselves .
at the same time , i would like to apologise once again to the citizens of tunisia , because the european union and its politicians were obviously not prepared for this sudden change of direction .
( bg ) dear mr. chairman , dear mr. rupel , dear mr. rehn , perhaps now is the time to once more express our regret that no agreement was reached on the status of kosovo between serbia and kosovo but there was no way for the negotiations to continue forever since both sides remained at their mutually exclusive positions .
it helped parliament and the council to design sound provisions which would protect the interests of unit - holders .
strict implementation of the lisbon strategy will therefore be decisive for buttressing europe 's competitive position in the global market through job creation , poverty reduction and social inclusion .
we have raised these matters in the various bilateral dialogues between japan and the eu over the past few years but little progress has been achieved so far .
do you think it is better , together with the dictator , to now force the refugees to return ?
they have tended to arrive in early january , when the orthodox christmas begins .
the report also criticises the increase of meat consumption , and asks for ways of tackling that .
however , the approach needs to be more holistic .
therefore , we call on the council to work more actively in the field of conflict resolution .
thermal resistance .
all the european institutions that depend on the european union budget have to be thoroughly audited by the court of auditors and by all entities with that function .
( pl ) improving the effectiveness of the mechanisms by which ucits function should , in my opinion , be a priority of parliament 's work .
could the commission indicate to what extent it will take account of these rulings which once again demonstrate the reluctance on the part of the airlines , the overly vague wording of regulation no. 261/2004 concerning the ' extraordinary circumstances ' justifying a cancellation and the passivity of the commission in the face of numerous violations of this regulation to the detriment of passengers ?
it falls to the high representative , now equipped with the power of initiative , under article 30 of the treaty , to propose and lead a true european strategy to assist in the closing of guantánamo as quickly as possible , ensuring the necessary support for the individual recovery and social reintegration of released persons , including their right to family reunification .
the european parliament is of the opinion that combating corruption , in particular , in the judiciary and the police , should be a top priority for the eu in the development of its relations with the eastern partners .
it is especially important that the laotian authorities show their democratic mindset by drafting and implementing legislative reforms as soon as possible .
an additional factor was the endless series of interventions in the course of the debate in the committee on transport and tourism .
( es ) madam president , i would also like to thank the rapporteur and the council for the work they have done in order to reach an agreement .
this proposal clarifies the issues involved and refers its adoption to plenary , bearing in mind the rules of procedure in force .
we therefore hope that , in the context of the amendments and debate , all the groups will help to reinforce this message instead of falling into the trap of using a dramatic situation such as that in somalia as an excuse for political diatribe within certain countries that have nothing to do with this debate and with the work of parliament .
therefore , it would appear that account has not been taken of the almost complete failure of the lisbon 2010 strategy .
yes , to carry on as i am !
on the contrary : we need to continue to work towards ensuring that the spirit of protecting public health that we have sought and achieved is maintained when it is transposed .
i am , however , confused with regard to certain aspects , perhaps due to excessive reliance on the commission 's assessments .
let me conclude by sharing with you a personal conviction .
i say ' dialogue ' because dialogue is always the first important step before moving on to negotiations .
another reason for introducing a tax on financial transactions is the fact that financial services are not subject to vat in most member states .
mitigating the consequences of the shrinkage of working population through immigration is only one possible solution . it will also lead to increased ethnic , cultural and religious diversity .
( applause )
in writing . - ( nl ) half - baked measures will be no help at all with the problem of lobbyists .
( de ) mr president , i have voted in favour of the capoulas santos report and of amendment 186 , which recommends a franchise of eur 10 000 for the modulation .
this eu budget continues to amount to about 1 % of gross national income .
member of the commission . - ( el ) mr president , honourable members of the european parliament , the final report by the temporary committee on climate change for which mr florenz acted as rapporteur has ambitious targets and covers a broad spectrum of issues , thereby confirming the considerable importance that the european parliament attaches to the question of climate change .
it was therefore decided that , before reducing the limits once again , it was first of all necessary to develop a new test cycle and bring the driving conditions for the noise test closer in line with real - life driving operations .
for those who speak of energy , we must clearly state that the eu wishes to strengthen cooperation with russia through the instruments we have - the meetings of the energy dialogue and the permanent partnership council on energy .
we need to be able to see within the whole chain from primary producer to supermarket chains where the added value is disappearing .
in particular , it is necessary to ensure the continuity of credit through action on liquidity and capital requirements and new initiatives in three strategic areas to boost the competitiveness of companies in a phase that is still difficult but certainly more development - oriented : internationalisation , innovation and growth in size .
we meps from attack want acknowledgement and an apology before any kind of discussion at all is initiated about turkey 's membership of the european union .
thus both the commission and the council must draft an action plan as soon as possible on establishing a visa free regime .
my third and final question is : do we need global or european rules ?
since the communist forces of the people 's republic of china ( prc ) invaded 61 years ago , tibetans have faced a systematic suppression of their unique way of life .
the total package of eur 1.8 billion represents an increase of 31 % or 22 % over the last five - year period .
in many european countries , there are parties that have succeeded in positioning themselves at the heart of political life with populist and demagogic discourses .
i would like to wish everyone a merry christmas and a happy new year .
regarding the proposals now on the table , i believe that parliament has an enormous responsibility in the coming months .
barbaric islamic forces are waging an all - out war against western civilisation .
what are we asking for in this report ?
but since the third quarter of 2007 , global shocks both to energy and food prices have put upward the pressure on inflation not only within the european union but throughout the whole world .
we should remember that we are living together with the outside world , and we should try to develop standards , mutual recognition and convergence with transatlantic players - because that is the way to currently open competition - and also very good rules on the protection of retail clients and the way these things go forward .
our esdp mission in bosnia and herzegovina continues to provide support and assistance to the icty and relevant authorities .
it has never been done before in the entirety of our common human history , but it must be done .
first of all , i welcome the discussions on the ratification of the treaty of lisbon .
a few months ago , we all voted on this major resolution on the 2020 programme , in which we decided to include items such as the greening of the economy , support for renewable energies , green technologies and so on , and everything that creates work and jobs .
i hope that you , commission president , will now finally take this seriously , because you said only a few weeks ago that we did not need a statement of this kind .
paying closer attention to the territorial and urban dimensions of eu policies , especially through integrated development plans and better cooperation between urban and periurban areas , will draw all the benefits out of this integrated approach .
dcm has a unique profile of adverse effects on human health , and is included in the list of 33 priority substances established under the terms of the water directive .
the major benefits deriving from the funds and initiatives implemented across the union bear witness to that .
the united action taken by all the parliamentary groups in the european legislative only serves to demonstrate that the budget needs to be reviewed on a much more flexible basis .
warns that the agreement may not comply with international data protection laws ;
improvements in terms of infrastructure and of building adequate facilities for unloading fish along mauritania 's central and southern coasts must be promoted , to enable the eu fleet to operate more efficiently , thereby facilitating the flow of investment and increasing this agreement 's impact on the local economy .
we are committed to ensuring that european legislation , and member states ' implementation measures , fully respect the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation .
following careful examination , the eu committee responsible recognised that these countries have fulfilled all the criteria for membership of the schengen area : they offer sufficient assurances as regards the protection of national borders on land , at sea and in the air and they have mastered the schengen information system for data exchange and reliably ensure data protection .
the answer , apparently , is to offer a vast catalogue of cultural , economic , technical developments and social engineering provision .
unacceptable deficits have been run up .
but it is also very clear that we need to press ahead with structural reforms and that we have to work even harder .
development is only possible in the presence of rules that prevent market distortion , respect institutional roles and make procedures swift .
we already acted promptly in december , and we should like to say to mr mccreevy , as mrs berès did a moment ago , that the lift ...
thank you for that comment .
although eu agricultural policy aims to provide safe , high - quality food products and contributes to the protection of the environment and to renewable energies , it must be adequately financed so as to encourage farmers to use modern , environmentally sound techniques .
i also supported amendments 33 and 223 , opposing complete liberalisation of planting rights from 1 january 2014 : the interests of wine - growers dictate that we should wait until the end of the grubbing - up scheme , to see how effective it has been , before we contemplate liberalisation .
progress has been made , but there is still a long way to go , and we must be ambitious when devising policies to ensure that one half of the population of europe enjoys the same rights and opportunities as the other half .
the most important aspect is to have consideration and respect for serbia .
broad consensus was , however , reached on how the scope of the directive should be widened , especially in the wording of annexes i and iii .
it is the nerve centre of the danish social model that is being threatened by the uncertainties and judicial activism of the services directive .
nonetheless , i would point out that this report is just one little piece of the puzzle in people 's everyday dealings with the eu .
we should not talk about sanctions or special taxes until we have completed the thorough reform of our financial sector , which , unfortunately , commands little trust today .
second , regarding the considerations that should be used in the community interest test , which allows us to determine that trade defence action is indeed in the wider economic interest of the european union - something which , as i say , is becoming increasingly complex and difficult to analyse , where situations are not quite as straightforward and not quite as black and white as they perhaps might appear on the surface , or indeed as was the case in the classic operation of trade defence machinery in the past .
i abstained during the vote on this text .
the next item is the report by mrs giannakou on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the application of regulation ( ec ) no 2004/2003 on the regulations governing political parties at european level and the rules regarding their funding ( a 7-0062-2011 ) .
but this vote is typical of the eu : pretending to be transparent and putting in place more bureaucracy at taxpayers ' expense .
that is why i would ask you firstly : have you already signed ?
the report provides a very comprehensive overview of what further actions are needed in this field .
i cannot describe them all here , but if i can briefly outline two , i should like to commend the projects for european defence and the union for the mediterranean , which will be unveiled next sunday in paris .
the participation of women in the decision - making process is essential to achieving a substantial change in their status in society and will have concrete significance for future improvements .
the eu must act in this regard by taking direct and decisive measures .
the internal market in postal services has been a long time coming .
first of all , we need to ensure that funding is made easier and there need to be more subsidies and incentives for venture capital .
this also increases the role of member states - and , as a member of the committee on regional development , it is this that i should like to discuss once more .
when it comes to food imports , the commission need to address the genuine concerns of eu farmers and producers that they will be banned from using certain substances but third countries continue to use them .
however , we believe that , in the current situation , in which we do not have all the facts to hand , we should not adopt a resolution , because to do so would be to anticipate the facts .
buildings account for as much as a third of greenhouse gas emissions , so our objective naturally includes active financial assistance from member states as well .
that must not take place .
i would therefore like to congratulate mrs flautre on her report .
thirdly , there is the question of political dialogue .
it is not necessary , therefore , to allow new exemptions apart from the small micro - enterprises , and it is not sensible at all to expand the number of exceptional cases or to make the rules more vague , as the rapporteur seems to want to do on certain points .
this includes , in particular , the case where the privatisation process of a company is ongoing .
this is absolutely clear .
they are not covered by this agreement .
my group remains opposed to the system .
that is why i find it worrying - adding to what has already been said by previous speakers - that some european leaders are now talking about more lax and flexible rules regarding the stability pact , and opting for a change to the treaty .
mr brok 's report recognises this great potential .
this is the only path open to us to restore hope to young people , to motivate them to take over family farms , to convince them that agriculture is , quite simply , a sector with a future .

i look forward to copenhagen , when the political class is sitting around the table awkwardly failing to mention the giant elephant in the room , which is that the globe has not actually warmed for the past 10 years .

that is why we need our own european set of standards for smes : we can build on the ifrs if that is appropriate but if it is not , then we will develop our own standards .
one way of tackling this would be to free ourselves from dependency on russian raw materials .
the debate on the report has been cancelled owing to the debate on the situation in georgia , which is an urgent and important matter .
their quality of life is also deteriorating .
it is now time for europe to speak with one voice on energy , because we face serious threats to security of supply , transit and investment .
then we will be left totally behind , being dependent on imports of ethanol and biodiesel ; because if we do not have these in place we will not be able to meet the targets of 20 % greenhouse gas emission by 2020 .
it is estimated that a group of between 350 000 and 900 000 people are affected .
however , in certain areas of shipping we must not set our environmental objectives as high as the sulphur emission control areas in the baltic and the north sea , otherwise the cost of transport will rise dramatically .
my view is that we need as much freedom as possible here , including in cabotage .
to mention just one of these , are we going to further arm the rebels - the collective term for a diverse bunch of people , some of whom by european standards have not yet mentally outgrown the middle ages - and if so , what guarantee do we have that such weapons would not be used to plunge the country into greater chaos , as happened in iran after the shah was expelled ?
the commission suggested , some time ago - two years ago i think - that emergency food aid be provided for some europeans , because there are now people in europe , too , who do not have enough to eat .
the short period planned for adjustment to the new requirements was one of the problems mentioned .

if we really want to export our poultry and pig industry outside the eu and feed our citizens on brazilian chicken and pork and even chicken from thailand , all of which has been fed on gm , then the present policies of zero tolerance on non - gm feed and the appallingly slow licensing of gm feed within the eu are exactly the way to go about it .
the original text of the commission proposal was also improved on the basis of the amendments which i tabled in the committee on agriculture and rural development .
in addition , we think that export subsidies for sugar must be completely removed in the long term .
however , security measures should not be misinterpreted as tokenism that causes nothing but inconvenience for passengers without actually increasing their safety .
question no 8 has been withdrawn .
there is one specific issue concerning the proposal to include bluefin tuna in appendix ii and i think it is important to note that there are very specific provisions in cites which would apply in the case of an appendix ii .

welcome
( applause )

the year 2009 was one in which help was essential in order to maintain the integrity and competitiveness of the single market .
finally , i wish to congratulate our rapporteur , who has largely managed to unite the members on a compromise text amid a debate which often aroused great passions , sending out a clear message so that the eu remains the world 's leading wine producer , guarantees a future for over one and a half million wine companies , and retains its ranking as leading exporter .
we would be putting our own forces in extreme danger and making them less effective if we said that for reasons of principle we europeans could not allow such a thing .
( parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment )
the first question was : can the commission explain why a decision was not taken in 1998 to ban the marketing of pharmaceuticals containing benfluorex ?
like many other countries in the european union , spain relinquished some of its sovereignty when it introduced the euro .
i think this is an important issue .
i fear that we could adopt many more resolutions on this matter without any solutions coming of it .
it will enable the country to benefit from the important advantages offered by economic and monetary union , as set out in the report adopted by the commission last may on 10 years of emu .
they need to be addressed as soon as possible so that the people of europe and the whole world can access europe 's cultural heritage .
we must do everything to make europe safe and restore confidence in this source of energy .
the pretext for banning the party was links it is alleged to have with the kurdish pkk .
consequently , either the issue over the name , which is being used as a cover for propaganda and efforts to put the current political situation first , will be resolved or negotiations will not start and no greek government will agree to this .
it is something that we can join hands with citizens over , but they must direct their message to the commission .
what is actually happening ?
the more divisions there are , the more difficult it will be when the three institutions hold discussions .
- before the vote :
since 2005 , the commission has been enforcing emas in five of the departments in brussels and in eight of its buildings .
written statements ( rule 142 )
however , the world still owes a debt to women .
at the same time , i oppose the imposition of excessive sanctions on european institution officials guilty of unauthorised disclosure of information about specific offices and potentially corrupt practices .
would that have been a proportionate response ?
yet greece , as the report itself emphasises , had seen a spectacular improvement in the effectiveness of forest protection between 2001 and 2004 .
how social is it to overturn the way national parliaments have tried to protect workers ?
i hope that the chairpersons will now be able to start their work .
documents received : see minutes
i would therefore ask you to help the commission , to help my colleague , to continue her and our simplification work and give a positive opinion on this proposal .
the lessons that we must draw post - fukushima include recommending the introduction of stress tests , laying down new common safety standards in the eu , and protecting ourselves from every possible scenario .
why are we spending so much money on launching this project , when we should be redirecting the euratom funding to enable us to move away from nuclear power and introduce renewable energy sources much more quickly ?
i particularly welcome what you said about cyprus and i wish you every success in implementing your ambitious climate targets .
our meetings can henceforth take place in strasbourg on thursdays only .
therefore it will be essential to recognise the importance of intellectual property that is inadequately protected .
as indicated in the motion for a resolution , it is important to provide incentives for research against bee diseases and to support european producers in the competition they must face against third countries , following the opening - up of the eu market to imported honey .
so the problem is serious , and the phenomenon of poverty has worsened further following recent enlargements of the eu .
essentially , these are the reasons why two member states opted for protocols protecting against the unexpected consequences of the effects of the charter .
we must not allow either of these situations to arise .
not only is the path taken by the us itself discredited by history but also , as i said earlier , social security levels and the general provision of social needs to ordinary people are strikingly different in the us and at a far lower level .
it is an american disease that has been caused by cheap , loose money .
however , the excessively slow absorption of funds from the new programming period which we have observed in many member states may threaten their effective utilisation .
as far as the reduction of pollutant emissions is concerned , the manufacturers are operating at the very limit of what is technically achievable .
( el ) mr president , the decision by the new president of the united states to close the prison at guantánamo was one of his first important and positive moves and i warmly welcome it .
this organisation must be provided with the staff and equipment it needs in good time .
i would like to warmly thank the rapporteurs and all those who were involved who helped us reach the position we have today .
this is not only a question of the motor industry , but is also about the electronics and textiles industries .
last but not least , in order to have a strong economy , promoting employment should be set as a basic objective .
the margins of the current multiannual financial framework are very narrow , even suffocating i would say , and they leave no room for manoeuvre in coming years ; for example , on the basis of the margins under titles 1a and 4 , unforeseen requirements cannot be met .
i would like to emphasise , as we have done many times before , that , in order to make these negotiations successful from our side , we have to speak with one voice .
equality between women and men is a fundamental right and common value of the european union .
i am a liberal member from catalonia , and my region - which is the source of 28 % of spain 's exports - also has a very high ratio of exports to gross domestic product : almost 30 % .
many arguments put forward by fellow members - be it mr kasoulides , mr brok , mr zaleski or others - are thoroughly worthy arguments .
i therefore hope that the 2020 strategy , which is based on a smart , sustainable and inclusive economy , will result in ambitious financial commitments to youth education and training , because in these times of systemic crisis , the medium - term survival of the eu is dependent on young people who are educated and mobilised by the european project .
mr president , firstly let me congratulate the commissioner on taking up her duties .
the report on the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council was aimed at amending the provisions currently in force and strengthening competition through a computerised reservations system .
it is clear what the consequences will be : farmers and undertakings will abandon production , thus creating more unemployment and adversely affecting the development of rural areas .
my fellow member has just pointed out that the member states also have very different situations in terms of their economies and geography - completely different .
mr president , commissioner , your answers have failed to convince me .
sanctions should not be wrongly targeted .
therefore , there is not even a case .
we hope that the commission will take these comments of ours on board .
the rules must therefore seek to make the relationship between companies more transparent by harmonising tariffs , the methods for calculating these tariffs and the operation of gas transmission systems .
just think how the heads of financial market institutions and investors , who indeed have difficulties in deciding , must feel .
have confidence in the parliamentary administration !
first , enlargement has highlighted the union 's so - called ' capacity for change ' .
after experiencing the solutions to date for assisting greece and the one - off protective bulwark erected last time , i wonder what would happen if the financial wizards from the markets picked up their calculators and began working out the actual worth of the solution and discovered that not even this was reliable enough to make them willing to risk investing their money in the area ?
it did all of this before choosing a new government , because the new era after the end of the cold war was to be a time of reconciliation , peace and community .
by mr désir , on behalf of the committee on international trade , on corporate social responsibility in international trade agreements .
while supermarkets currently work with economic margins of some 20 % and the distribution trade with margins of nearly 10 % , many primary producers - the farmers - without whom none of the food would be there - are working with negative returns at the moment .
we must act before it is too late to reverse the trend in rising global food prices .
in answer to the honourable member 's question : yes , we shall try in this area to follow some of what has been done in the united states in an intelligent and efficient manner .
the council is asking us to renounce these principles in order to move swiftly .
the application of funds is not helped either by the fact that latvia counts as one region .
we spent when there was no crisis , we spent during the crisis , we are spending now on our way out of the crisis .
moreover , the resolution proposes that the court fulfil this task stipulated by the treaty .
on behalf of the alde group . - ( fr ) mr president , for over twenty years we have known that the population of southern sudan does not want sharia law imposed by khartoum .
this primary objective must be maintained .
our response to the recession must be based on solidarity and sound economics .
but then the ways of working of the eurosceptics - not least in my own country - have always been a bit of a mystery .
congratulations !
we are to have two constitutional amendments in ireland on the issue of the family and the case i just mentioned , and i think we need to see where the eu fits into children 's rights so that we vote in ireland in the right way .
all the measures for rural development implemented by member states and the regions are not always aimed at simplification but instead add layer upon layer of red tape .
in the same vein , i agree with the need expressed in mr lambsdorff 's proposal for the member states to exert pressure during discussions to reform the united nations security council in order to obtain a permanent seat for the european union .
thank you , commissioner .
secondly , all forms of ownership should be treated equally , and choice of one or another should be based on the effectiveness of management of each form .
or perhaps in the end , when you look at this whole process , you wonder whether there is the leadership on both sides to complete this or whether it was just an idea of the 20th century , which , in the 21st century , makes no sense at all .
that is the real question .
we cannot understand why anyone fleeing from war or from desperate circumstances should be treated like a criminal , and that applies all the more so in the case of children , all of whom are entitled to protection and education in accordance with the convention on the rights of the child .
keep up and do the good work , but leave it to the member state .
tunisia needs our support , encouragement and dialogue , not a constant stream of senseless invective .
on a different note , you rightly spoke of education and the bologna process .
i voted against the report because unemployment , which is constantly increasing in the european union , cannot be combated with a microfinance programme .
the concept of a ' market economy ' is understood very differently by various people and this is a behavioural factor .
madam president , i wish to refer to the previous speaker 's concluding words .
the second subject that i wish to raise concerns immigration policy .
hamas did nothing like this in connection with the rocket attacks on israel .
allow me to congratulate those five member states that have already ratified the lisbon treaty .
the current crisis appears to be a financial collapse , but energy and food are also involved .
they too , by supplementing the monetary policies operated by the central bank , have to introduce sound policies capable of supporting price stability .
it is not acceptable to , yet again , subordinate the eu budget strategy - this time for 2012 - to the objectives of the so - called europe 2020 strategy , heir to the failed ' lisbon strategy ' whose stated objectives of poverty reduction and job creation were no more than propaganda .
yesterday , the italian parliament launched its first day in favour of legalising the corruption of members of parliament .
this has been a tough fight .
( de ) mr president , i am loathe to speak on this matter , but i have a request to all members taking part , whether it be mr ferber , or mr maňka , who belongs to my group .
mr president , just to add an irish voice to this debate : i , too , share the disillusionment with the extent of nationalism across this floor .
the diverging european views on the problem of kosovo constitute an admission of the cfsp 's failure .
it is therefore important to know that the commission can show what progress has been achieved by the member states in preparing for the ban on the rearing of laying hens in conventional batteries from 1 january 2012 , what measures it will take against member states whose producers do not comply , and what measures it will take to prevent potential unfair competition from third countries in the eu egg market from 1 january 2012 .
however , i look forward to constructive cooperation on these matters and i would like to thank the commission for the initiative .
for this reason , it is important to continue to combat the gender stereotypes that persist in our societies , despite various community programmes to promote gender equality .
in poor working or operating conditions , this has led to or contributed to fatal accidents in several member states .
it cannot be done without information !
nevertheless , i would like to make an observation regarding paragraph 35 of the report .
( de ) mr president , as ever , the funding bodies of the eu are having some problems .
i have only two or three minutes if i understand rightly .
we have seen the potential for the political abuse of the dual - use list , particularly in the countries of central and eastern europe .
the active role of the european regions in promoting this strategy must also be highlighted .
we are very indebted to his hard work .
would such a move not be totally inconsistent with those sections of the commission communication that we are discussing here today , including the following :
i think that the directorate general for health and consumer protection has come further in its green paper than the members of the directorate general for competition .
mr mandelson 's resignation from the post of trade commissioner is one reason for this .
what needs to happen now ?
i think he is right about that .
of course , it makes sense to put larger contracts out to tender and , of course , there must be rules in place to ensure that corruption and nepotism do not become rife .
in any case , i have been to these countries and i have been shocked by the fact that these people feel abandoned by the european union in their daily struggle .
it is clear that the status quo is not working .
what we need is a forward - looking strategy : better measuring instruments in the airspace to predict atmospheric changes and the development of aircraft engines that use fuel more efficiently and are less sensitive .
19 .
it should be said that , in their time , some members of this parliament were advocates of paedophilia in the name of universal freedom and of the right of all , no matter how young , to sexuality .
i ask myself who we are actually paying attention to here .
we are currently facing our most severe crisis , and you are exhibiting irresponsible behaviour .
it is also clear that we need to find common european answers to common challenges in the areas of climate change , energy , security and migration .
development of an eu criminal justice area (
we have to keep in mind that the most important thing we can give to smes is a real internal market .
in the absence of such a european strategy , each country will try to solve its problems regarding the roma population sometimes by using policies and means that are incompatible with the fundamental human rights , the free movement of people in the european area .
an analysis of the 2006 annual activity report of the budget dg has in effect identified what still needs to be done before achieving transparency in the eu 's accounts .
the commission is continuing its work in support of the initiatives of civil society , not least through the european initiative for democracy and human rights .
for this reason , we propose the inclusion of the possibility of increasing the eu co - financing rates provided for in the area of the collection , management and use of scientific data , both basic and supplementary , on the status of fish stocks .
given this , it is vital that the authority in charge of the ' internet of things ' respects the safety , data protection and the privacy of whoever uses it , as only such an approach can bring benefits to eu citizens .
having seen earlier drafts of the commission proposals which included resource efficiency , it is a mystery to me why such proposals were not followed through .
in writing . - ( de ) in nigeria there have been repeated outbreaks of violence between christians and muslims and each of these two groups represent around half of the population .
not at all , not at all , mr barroso .
if my information is correct , it is as follows .
in this connection , the commission could also add another key point , and that is to concentrate on fresh organic produce .
this problem is the subject of another eu regulation - brussels iia .
as things stand , the ambitious annapolis targets are scarcely achievable .
i cannot believe that .
therefore , the kenyan government and president should act together and honour their own obligations to respect freedom of the press , speech and assembly .
in 2009 , the european social fund has almost eur 11 billion available in resources for payments .
the response since 11 september 2001 has consisted of manifold actionism : each time there is an attack , the respective governments have endeavoured to reassure the population by launching short - term measures , be it the british vehemence in pushing through data retention in the immediate aftermath of the tragic attacks in london , or germany 's endeavours to push through online searches .
in this way we have fulfilled the commitment that we made , in front of you , at the beginning of our term of office .
should we succeed in meeting an ambitious reduction goal , while not increasing energy security risks , we must adopt a series of short - , medium - and long - term measures that will decrease our energy dependency .
the roots of that bad phenomenon lie in nuremberg , where nazis were simply acquitted of initiating a conspiracy with stalin in the second world war .
thank you , president zatlers , it was a joy to welcome you here today .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the massacre on 23 november of last year in the province of maguindanao in the philippines was a black day for human rights and a barbaric act of terrorism .
should this not have been dealt with by the european union rule of law mission ( eulex ) instead of serbia ?
i see the implementation of the rotterdam convention on prior informed consent ( pic ) as a positive step in this policy area .
they have a black - coloured passport and for that reason , they are called ' blacks ' or ' aubergines ' .
this implies a corresponding responsibility to monitor how negotiations are conducted more closely .
however , we must not create artificial barriers for this country , as has , unfortunately , repeatedly been the case over the last few years .
the recent execution of ms delara darabi , hanged on 1 may for a crime she allegedly committed when she was a minor , is another confirmation of this dismal situation .
two , the fact that power is shifting , both within political systems - roughly from governments to markets , media and ngos - and between political systems - roughly from the old ' west ' to both the east and the south .
implementation of the strategy will be crucial , however . president barroso announced a task force for culture back in november 2005 in budapest , which could be an important signal to the outside world , but has not so far been implemented .
they feel marginalised , and in actual fact they are often left to struggle on their own .
be sure .
in addition to subjects as important as energy and innovation , i call on this council to debate and draw up a solution to the financial crisis that the european union is experiencing .
we are on the verge of reforming the common fisheries policy and therefore , we are under a particular obligation to be cautious and not to act prematurely with regard to this matter either .
with the envisaged improvements , i am confident that we will come closer to this objective .
the joint parliamentary assembly or jpa has become a key instrument of political dialogue as well as conflict prevention and resolution .
i spoke to people who had run for their lives , quite literally with only the clothes on their backs .
( the oral amendment was adopted )
control of exports has a large impact on eu trade policy .
( ga ) madam president , financial assistance for energy efficiency and renewable energy with the objective of economic recovery represents sensible and worthwhile investment .
we also agree with the rapporteur when he urges us , the eurogroup , the ecofin council in general , and our bank , to draw the appropriate financial conclusions from the crises we have been facing , particularly as regards monitoring of the markets and the transparency we shall need to add to our current mechanisms .
so what is the issue as far as they are concerned ?
at other , possibly small airports , an airline can decide whether or not to use the airport on the basis of how low the airport charges are , which is a totally different situation .
as the least - developed countries are the ones who will suffer mostly from climate change , therefore it is logical that certain parts of the development budget are pinpointed to different kinds of climate actions .
we must also convince others , so that we are not alone .
these problems must be solved as quickly as possible .
it is about punching through the rhetoric and removing some of the scurrilous excuses on both sides of the atlantic for those things that we need to do in order to be able to lift our economies and reward the people in those economies with growth , especially at the present time with the financial crisis around us .
i believe that the agreement on the table , following parliament 's first reading in july 2007 and the adoption of the council 's common position in november , allows us to achieve the main objectives .
the work carried out to conclude this agreement must therefore be applauded as the new legal framework ensures wide - ranging agreement on the creation of an integrated transatlantic aviation market that will be to the benefit of both consumers and companies .
( pl ) the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is one of the foundations of the european theory of values , which defends the rights of the individual and human rights .
many of the member states are in favour of it , as are the confederation of european industries and the entire european trade union movement .
( ro ) rail transport must be a priority in the eu 's transport policy up to 2020 , supporting such objectives as opening up competition , improving the national networks ' interoperability and safety and developing the rail transport infrastructure .
however , what no one in austria and in the rest of europe understands , under these circumstances , is that the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats has prevented one of the largest causes of co 2 emissions , namely heavy goods transit traffic , from having to pay even a single euro cent for the costs it has given rise to .
i hope that all democratic forces which pledge to respect pluralism , freedom of conscience and arrangements for the democratic handover of power will be able to take part in the election of a new parliamentary assembly .
the issue at stake is the security of civil aviation .
i think it is very good that , on certain points , commissioner reding has distanced herself from her proposal .
the answer to this is more institution , and the way that we will have more institution is through the treaty of lisbon . we must ensure that the treaty comes into force soon .
i would like to explain to the honourable member that this subject is so important that i should have at least seven to eight minutes speaking time .
the european union is a union which says ' yes ' rather than ' no ' .
i think that the european union needs a strong and effective security and defence policy to prevent conflicts , protect its citizens ' security and reaffirm its basic values , by making its contribution to supporting international law , the promotion of respect for human rights and democratic values throughout the whole world .
( pl ) viewed from the perspective of the 10 years of existence of economic and monetary union , we need to ask ourselves whether we truly associate the euro sign with prosperity and stabilisation .
small and medium - sized enterprises ( smes ) account for around 99 % of all eu businesses and make a key contribution to economic growth : as well as a source of jobs and wealth , they are particularly suitable vehicles for innovation .
this will enable us not only to interconnect the whole continent , but also facilitate the free movement of goods and services from the audiovisual sector , thereby considerably expanding this market .
i believe that we now have an urgent situation regarding social matters , particularly in view of rising unemployment .
i believe that the situation can be improved .
the aim of the regulation was to enable the cooperating partners to use legislation which would have same effects in both countries , because until then the method of simultaneous application of two legal systems had not been effective .
paternity leave needs to be regulated in connection with the system for parental leave , and not in connection with leave in the sense of recovering from pregnancy or childbirth .
unmoved as it is by the plight of its own people , it is unlikely to be influenced by what is said in the european parliament , but in the name of humanity we must speak out .
at that time we benefited greatly from the same solidarity fund that we are talking about .
in this respect , it should be pointed out that there have even been regional governments , such as my government in aragon , which was pioneering a year ago when it proposed a guarantee for the figueruelas plant .
( de ) madam president , today we have discussed the european globalisation adjustment fund and now we are talking about micro - credits .
they make a huge contribution to the promotion of cultural dialogue , and the task , here too , is to establish new global balances in this sector between the united states and between other continents , which are major producers , and europe , which has its rightful place .
there is still a lot to do in the country as regards respect for democracy , human rights and the rule of law .
this is because it can take up to five years to come to a final decision .
i will perhaps begin with the statement which has been made here that a passport is a document issued by member states in accordance with national regulations .
men were separated from their families and brought to prison camps where many of them died or were executed .
hopefully we will go forward and have better protection of human rights in the european union than we have now .
many of the changes which were provided for in this treaty were good , even necessary , but couched in such obscure , incomprehensible language that hardly anyone could understand .
the additional eur 1 billion will make sure that developing countries are not left behind .
commissioner , informing the public of health risks is a difficult and delicate task and has to be perfectly documented and verified .
in my country , italy , we have a system which more or less forces people to retire at the age of 58 or 59 , when at the same time only 20 % of the unemployed have any social protection .
these include amendments on minor infringements , the definition of the link between companies and transport managers , the right of appeal of those subject to decisions on operating as a transport manager , mutual recognition of certificates , prior rights , the exchange of information between the competent authorities , as well as drugs and human trafficking as grounds for exclusion from the profession .
we stand up to china over tibet ; we stand up to china over human rights ; it is time we stood up to china over taiwan .
that would also be a good trip to make .
moves in this direction include the european private company statute , the initiatives to create companies in 48 hours , to reduce administrative costs by 25 % by 2012 , the creation of a one - stop scheme for vat and reduced vat rates for labour - intensive and locally supplied services , and a common consolidated corporate tax base .
madam commissioner , you are from sweden .
such events should never reoccur .
i 'd also like to take this opportunity to say that i hope our caution also shows our solidarity and fraternity with our greek and portuguese colleagues who are having a notably difficult time at the moment .
the issue of the sustainability of social security systems has become an unavoidable subject on europe 's political agenda .
i apologise to the honourable member because i was immediately told off for pronouncing his surname incorrectly , which is botòpoulos and not botopoùlos , i apologise again .
even now , we still feel the consequences of chernobyl , and therefore today , we must reassess our approach to nuclear safety in the eu and the rest of the world .
toys are , in fact , the products with the highest number of irregularities , and china is the country of origin with the most infringements .
the problem is not tariffs but the numerous restrictive regulations and obstructions faced by eu companies in gaining access to the japanese market .
our refusal to do this , even at the height of the bombing in january , indicated that we prefer the status quo of business as usual , with our contribution of humanitarian aid possibly being a salve to our conscience .
between 21 september and the early morning of 24 september , 595 sub - saharan nationals arrived on spanish beaches .
contrary even to union provisions , it is planned to make the entire staff of that factory redundant , to knock down all the buildings and to put modern facilities beyond use .
the discharge procedure should be simplified and streamlined for the decentralised agencies , which are growing in number ( from 8 in 2000 , to 20 in 2006 ) and represent a total budget of around eur 1 billion .
i would ask the competent authorities to be more proactive in the fight against corruption , organised crime and the trafficking of people , arms and drugs .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i fear , unfortunately that the message just delivered cannot surely be a message of hope intended to restore confidence .
penalizing the internal aviation industry will cause the occurrence of the " carbon leakage " phenomenon , namely the orientation towards markets with less strict rules than those imposed by the eu , thus starting a commercial war .
it is well known that for centuries these institutions have experienced difficulties in properly protecting archive material received from different sources .
we especially regret the failure to prioritise a reference to the revision of the posting of workers directive .
addiction , medical problems , social misery , abuse , all these things are well known .
the last speaker , mr rack , said that a new culture has to be developed .
do not forget that both of these flights ended up totally enveloped by dust from volcanoes which had erupted only shortly beforehand and which were relatively nearby .
parliament 's assent to any future agreement will depend on a radical change in the underlying objectives of the agreement towards the protection and sustainable management of tropical forests , with trade in tropical timber taking place only to the extent that it is consistent with that objective .
firstly , improvement of legal migration channels ;
- thank you , i am sure that was the reason for the proposed amendment .
it will be up to the investigation to determine the extent to which those characteristics were responsible for the tragedy .
this brings no additional military capability and merely duplicates or adds complexity to the well - tried arrangements under nato .
they are , indeed , issuing permits to both arabs and israelis in both parts of the town , but what the commission is saying now , and also said last week , is : you have to discriminate against israelis in east jerusalem because the city is one whole entity , anyway , and that cannot be changed , the town is governed by a single local authority .
this is by no means a new idea , yet to date we have not done enough in this regard .
- joint motion for a resolution
in this second phase , our aim is therefore twofold : firstly , to once again defend an equal right to education to ensure just and democratic societies and , secondly , to increase the participation of women in order to prevent talent being wasted in science and culture .
at the moment , the union is not fulfilling its role properly as a global actor .
europe 's cities are its centres of economic activity , innovation and employment , but they must face up to a number of challenges .
for this reason , i have mainly focused in my amendment proposals on the need to upgrade the information campaign in support of this project .
the intention of this legislation , which i applaud , is to protect our citizens ' health and environment and agriculture .
to back up the proposals we already have on the table , such as illegal migration , undeclared work and the blue card for highly - skilled workers , we will come forward with new proposals next year to build a truly comprehensive approach at european level regarding migration .
( et ) ladies and gentlemen , the harassment of the director of the st petersburg office of the british council , mr kinnock , and his colleagues going as far as questioning by the russian authorities requires our full attention .
the commission has made ambitious proposals , for instance in relation to stress tests ; it is the european commission and the european central bank who have proposed credible and transparent tests for the european bank .
they were allowed to stay together until the night of 2-3 august 1944 , when the surviving captives of the 30 000 inhabitants of their camp were murdered as their barracks were burned . '
i should therefore like to ask the bureau and parliament 's administration to look into how we can salvage the situation at this point before parliament goes into recess after 7 may , so that we can discuss and restore this situation during the next part - session .
parliament has tackled this issue at several sittings , particularly through our speeches .
it is time for the eu to boost competitiveness in the mobility industry by cutting development costs for manufacturers and gradually reducing the co 2 levels generated by road transport .
we are paying very close attention to the pre - positioning of relief stocks . most of them were completely depleted after the earthquake .
i am glad to support this report and hope that it will be the start of more measures in this direction .
as regards the second question about the 70 % rate for cofinancing , the initial percentage rate was 60 % and i felt that , in the current economic climate , it was necessary to increase it .
it will give some benefits to consumers and small businesses .
reports of planned cuts of up to 30 % by the irish government to some services amply illustrates their lack of real commitment to prevention , protection and prosecution .
that is one of the risk elements .
we monitor the adaptation to technological change . we monitor the measures in order to ensure fair competition .
however , i would like to point out in this context that it is the member states that are the main decision - makers as regards language policy , including regional and minority languages whose framework is laid down in the council of europe 's european charter for regional or minority languages .
it is indeed outrageous to hear a british tory , i take it , a member of this parliament , malign and slander belgian railway workers in the course of his contribution when it is quite clear that the policies of neoliberalisation and deregulation have done enormous damage to our railway system as a public facility .
the budget has to be in line with the fine words of our treaty and of our policies like eu 2020 , the great innovation union , digital access to all , the next generation network , and so forth .
this also means , though , that we need to indicate the areas in which we want to cut costs .
it is therefore necessary and imperative to adopt a common , cross - border european system of prevention and response to oil spills .
on the contrary : at a time of financial economic downturn , both european governments and european institutions need to hold firmly to the principles of the single market .
as a result of the fact that the decision that we took was not based on solid enough grounds , we required ireland to provide us with additional information so that we would be able to base our decision on a more solid basis .
sweden and the czech republic are to ratify the treaty by the end of this year , and i still have not given up hope that ratification is still possible in ireland before the european elections .
lagging regions that are battling with complex problems are unable to raise the counterpart funds necessary in order to obtain the community assistance to which they are legally entitled . in the case of roma people , meanwhile , the disadvantages they face as a result of a low educational level and generations of unemployment are multiplied several times over .
these environmental accounts can help us in this regard .
however , most of them believe that europe is hindering their ability to produce more food by forcing a reduction in stocking rates through nitrate and phosphate regulations , red tape , a lack of research and development within the industry , and hence an attitude that food security is not an issue .
in writing . - ( de ) the commission 's proposals primarily aim to tighten up the regulations of the stability and growth pact .
it will also be the year of a new start for the community and the member states in that field .
we know that the cheapest way of promoting development is to improve women 's rights , including their sexual rights , education , opportunities for employment and so on .
i should like to congratulate the chair of the committee on employment and social affairs , mrs berès , on this initiative which enables us to debate a very important subject .
combating female genital mutilation in the eu ( short presentation )
they are concerned with the creation of a milk fund that will support reforming activities in this sector , such as the promotion of milk consumption , including consumption in schools , or support for milk production in mountainous areas .
i therefore believe that the commission 's proposal is a typical case of a certain hyperactivity that is totally unnecessary and will only serve to generate confusion as to the nature of the european union 's real competences .
the implementation of ecvet needs to be based on a common commitment to observing the principles for guaranteeing good quality vocational education and training .
nevertheless , mrs reding , we need to clarify the fundamental principles for protecting the rights of national minorities in europe .
( hu ) i believe that the second roma summit in córdoba provides an excellent opportunity to take stock of what has been achieved in the past few years concerning the integration of the largest and most vulnerable ethnic minority in europe , the roma .
we are usually so quick to react to all sorts of events all over the world , with one resolution after another , and yet this fundamental crisis seems to have left us speechless .
i can , of course , inform you myself , but i think it will be more effective if we have this light at every desk .
this means that much can and must be done by the european union , and i therefore call once again upon parliament to go forward in the direction already embarked upon through the vote in the committee on transport and tourism .
ultimately , we should also create the infrastructure to enable our employees to enjoy job security .
in this context , the movement for a million signatures that began organising around two years ago in iran is one of the most important manifestations of iranian civil society 's wish to demonstrate its opposition to the regime in power .
i have taken note of this issue .
we welcome the commission 's strategy , therefore .
the new procedures will begin to apply to all existing legislation from day one .
it is part of an overall compromise and , taking all the circumstances into account , i do not think it would have been proper for the commission to allow the question of transitional deadlines for a few products to cause the compromise to fail .
the tax will also respond to the millennium development goals and contribute to large european projects in infrastructure , research , ecological restructuring and in our system of production .
the health and safety of meps , employees and visitors to parliament should be an absolute priority .
one speaker mentioned that it is crucial that we ourselves should be able to distinguish between important and non - important matters ; the role of the legislature is really to concentrate on vital matters and for this reason it needs to delegate certain powers to the executive , in other words to the commission , but we must retain the possibility and the right to scrutinise implementing measures drawn up by it .
to conclude , it is our duty for future generations to continue to lead by example and reach a legally binding agreement by the end of this year , ensuring a better and sustainable future for all .
i have waited almost 20 years for the right to speak for six minutes in the chamber , but to do so before an audience such as this was a real pleasure .
the support cannot be free of charge .
now i come to my final point on the proposal to amend the regulation establishing a european railway agency .
i am sorry to see that failed .
the barcelona objectives also help towards achieving the lisbon objectives of having 60 % of women in the labour market by making the reconciliation of public and professional life possible for women workers .
i am abstaining from the vote because there do not seem to be any new , tangible proposals for the new regulation .
the real problem of this debate is a problem we have here .
some operate in as many as 15 member states .
extending the agreement for scientific and technological cooperation with the united states is a confirmation of the need for cooperation and mutually beneficial exchanges between the eu and us in the cutting - edge sectors of research and innovation .
anyone who has heard your speech knows that president arias and costa rica stand for freedom and democracy .
however , that area still experiences unequal treatment between nationals of a member state and those from third countries .
we can agree today , however , by way of exception .
i also agree that the social economy should however engage with continually evolving market developments , in order to come up with effective strategies to meet its objectives .
uganda is a country in which the majority of people survive on a dollar a day : surely the country 's legislators can find better ways to serve the interests of ugandan society than to make gays subject to criminal prosecution .
due to their structural importance , some policies condition all the others .
a total of eur 21.1 billion has been earmarked for urban development in 2007-2013 , to be targeted at the rehabilitation of industrial sites and contaminated land areas , urban and rural regeneration , clean urban transport , and housing .
this divergence affects regions in my country , in particular northern portugal , and also other regions in other member states .
we cannot impose additional constraints on our farms , which are facing increasing global competition , and at the same time reduce their support .
( fr ) mr president , multilingual teaching , polyglot teachers addressing each child in his or her mother tongue , foreign teachers recruited especially for them , respect for and even promotion of cultures of origin by schools , minimum knowledge of the language of the host country , without this even being considered as really obligatory : this type of recipe does not lead to the integration of migrants . it would lead meanwhile , and paradoxically , to the ghettoisation of our societies , to the blurring of identities , and to the acculturation of all , whether migrants or the original inhabitants of the host country .
in the spirit which should preside over this similar agreement , all measures which remove obstacles to contact between european citizens and those of this other portuguese - speaking country are obviously to be welcomed .
whilst it is very important to manage financial crises , more needs to be done for the smes right now , because they are the real economy .
it is not right for domestic workers to be coerced into informal work , regardless of their rights , because of an immigration regulation that is too strict and ill - adapted .
( de ) madam president , i would also like to say a few words about ireland .
to do so would be to risk making things worse for employees .
one of them is to build a coherent , integrated and professional eu approach to the external dimension of social policy .
it is a new initiative , which is still in its infancy , and we cannot say desertec is part of our security of supply strategy .
it is therefore absolutely essential to move to 30 % , and i shall conclude by echoing the words of barack obama when he said that we could abandon the jobs of the future to our competitors or we could seize the opportunity of the century , as they have already begun to do .
this approach , by which i mean your approach , mr barroso , and your commission 's approach , has created a confidence gap between the leadership of the european union and european citizens , which was clearly reflected in the last elections , with the massive numbers of european citizens who abstained .
what action are we going to take ?
president van rompuy , you spoke about budgetary discipline .
during this parliamentary term , parliament has adopted 389 legal acts in the codecision procedure .
it is in my own country in the 18th and 19th centuries .
a simple way to achieve this goal is thermal rehabilitation of buildings .
the world today is determined by economic fundamentalism .
freedom of expression is formally obstructed under article 301 of the turkish penal code .
just for your information .
this is why i think it is a huge mistake .
recent events confirm the need to improve the european union 's response to crises .
the same would seem to be true for ship transport of co 2 as compared with ship transport of liquefied natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas .
israel must , at the very least , respect the principles of international law .
profits spiral ever higher while wage levels stagnate .
many of them are living on the breadline and they deserve to benefit from their genius and this certainly can be done by protecting the ipr online and offline environments .
the experts are trying to persuade us that the right preventive measures mean the oil companies have relatively few accidents - yes , this is true .
sooner rather than later we will have to address resource efficiency .
europe has therefore done well to tackle this problem head - on .
thus we need united action and a pro - active approach , not the invisible hand .
eu - us air transport agreement (
i hope that in the near future , we will also be successful in achieving an understanding on indicating the origin of goods .
it was not easy .
mr president , i think we ought to do away with this notion of european money .
this is a magnificent result after just four years .
this report by mrs jordan cizelj does put the emphasis in the right place .
just as we do not want a financial market that does not function properly and that is closed and completely unregulated , we do not want an electricity market that operates like the financial market did before the crisis either .
their fate has been a matter of concern for the european parliament since the 1990s .
the commission should carry out , as soon as possible , an impact study on the taxation of financial transactions at eu and global level in order to examine the effect and economic benefits they produce by reducing the volume of speculative financial transactions that are currently causing serious market disturbances .
the implementation of this policy should be supported by reforms in education , vocational education and training and retraining programmes , in order to adapt them to labour market needs , and it should receive the backing of small and medium sized enterprises .
thank you very much , mr cohn - bendit .
but national governments still seem to think that it is enough to set up task forces and working groups and talk about maybe seeking closer cooperation , and then again maybe not .
this will in fact remain under the competence of the member states and the partner higher education institutions .
why should we expect a driver , whose job it is to drive safely , to take a special course that will allow him or her to provide assistance to persons with reduced mobility or disabilities ?
( de ) madam president , around ten years ago , the then 14 other eu member states imposed their so - called ' sanctions ' on my country , austria .
that is an intelligent system because intelligence , in my view , is collecting and using information .
it is a move in the right direction .
i would like to ask you whether you can confirm that neither you nor the commission departments were at any time already aware of the actual figures before the greek government submitted the most recent figures concerning its budgetary deficit .
there are all sorts of examples i could give here .
if a train is delayed , 25 % of the fare is repaid in compensation after an hour .
( sk ) ladies and gentlemen , meeting the president of the pan - african parliament , mrs gertrude mongella , in the european parliament made a very powerful impression on me .
in the committee on regional development , we had a fairly hopeless discussion on this .
i am surprised listening to this debate .
in writing . - i consider the role of parliament to be only effective if it can sustain the effect of legislation .
austrian aerodromes also come under this new rule .
both the un and the commission undertook to apply specific guidelines and to monitor their application closely .
i think , ladies and gentlemen , that we cannot sell ourselves short on requirements for full respect for human rights and international law in drawing up blacklists , in putting people 's names on these lists or taking them off .
we need many more interconnectors and interconnections .
countries then transformed that private debt into public debt , and this is the problem greece is having to contend with now : an unbearable level of public debt .
europe can play an important role .
this is not the way to conduct politics and take serbia forward .
however , i think that , at least today , nobody can say exactly what promises or preoccupations there will be in this particular area .
allow me to quote some interesting figures .
for these visas , people in those countries have to pay roughly as much as they earn per month .
we have worked well together as rapporteurs and i believe that we have found an excellent compromise that we can fully support .
in writing . - ( it ) i am voting firmly in favour of this motion for a resolution on stepping up the european union 's disaster response capacity .
thus , every effort , from whatever direction , to remove visas is good , positive and to be supported , not criticised .
this is , of course , impossible .
although i voted in favour of the proposals put forward by the rapporteur , paolo costa , i am not any less aware of the limits of this compromise .
financing the same is essential and the european social fund can finance immediate actions to be taken by member states with regard to both flexicurity and skills .
my question is as follows .
consumers must know their rights when a service is provided too late or in an incorrect manner .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will be answered in writing ( see annex ) .
all of this clearly shows that the lisbon treaty is completely unnecessary for the adoption of the sort of fundamental decisions that are clearly good for member state citizens .
i believe that it is important for member states to devise specific strategies and initiate concrete actions for developing tourism in coastal regions , taking into account the special nature of the surrounding environment and with a view to protecting it .
this concerns extending the powers of the european railway agency to allow it to compile the various national procedures and existing technical rules for authorisation of locomotives , and to draw up and subsequently extend the list of requirements to be verified once only , either because these are internationally recognised rules or because they may be considered as equivalent between the member states .
we have proposed a package of macro - financial assistance worth eur 200 million , for which we are seeking the approval of parliament .
he hones in on a number of important issues , the importance of shipping for our economy , to begin with .
it seems , certainly as far as we are concerned , that today in vietnam , the supreme patriarch of the unified buddhist church of vietnam , thich huyen quang , who for 26 years has been under house arrest in his monastery , and thich quang do , his deputy , the candidate nominated by many of us , will not even be able to celebrate the rites freely .
the global financial crisis has exposed the inconsistent behaviour of european union governments and the european central bank , which are able to find funds to save banks from collapse , thereby breaching the provisions of the stability pact , when for many years they would not permit the slightest departure from the pact 's rules in order to meet important social needs .
expert supervision is in fact necessary , particularly because the galileo programme is a first for the european union .
these problems have clearly not been made any better by the economic crisis , which is making it difficult for many countries to find cofinancing .
this morning , we saw something different , although we would have liked parliament to have been more involved .
the second part of your response was a sales pitch for entry - exit .
you are aware that the irish people 's expectations of change , like those of european people in general , are much deeper than those you have described .
i believe europe also has a job to do there .
it should be noted , however , that voluntary use of such a label is not prohibited and any such moves which are of benefit to consumers should be encouraged .
that would be to create a management and control system guaranteeing genuine liquidity across the european union 's entire economic system .
that is the very high threshold that it faced .
it is essential , in planning future social policies , to focus on the idea of the welfare society , in which all of us , as citizens , have more responsibility and show more solidarity .
we shall then have additional problems at least in that sector .
how could one possibly applaud the reversal of the burden of proof , for example , even though it is a key principle of the rule of law that people should be proven guilty instead of innocent ?
they maintain that those scientists that issue warnings concerning the impact of human beings on climate change do so in order to attract funds for research and spread alarm amongst the population .
first , the role of national parliaments in shaping development aid in the new member states needs to be strengthened .
i therefore support this report and would congratulate mrs matias on the work she has carried out and on all the compromises that she has negotiated .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this directive is a disgrace and an insult to europe 's legal culture .
there is no need to provide any structural support to other sectors in the economy .
and to that end it will use all means , all possible mechanisms at its disposal .
you remarked that the alignment of the subsidies will not take place until 2016 , which , during this crisis , puts the two newly admitted countries in an extremely unfair position .
the key issue is that the research activities are market - oriented and aimed at short to medium - term commercial results .
the treaty of lisbon is just about to enter into force .
a new , but extremely negative situation will be created .
countries such as spain are making significant efforts in this respect , prosecuting traffickers , raising public awareness and promoting reintegration plans for the women who are the victims .
allow me to finish by underlining once again how much i appreciate sarajevo 's place in european history and its cultural significance .
since may 2009 , when denmark granted free access to its labour market , the transitional provisions applied by member states have stayed the same , and whereas a majority of member states do grant free access to workers from those member states that joined after 1 may 2004 , 10 member states are still applying restrictions .
these ' explanations ' are fundamental for interpretation of the content of the cfr but almost never accompany it .
the closure of small post offices in estonia has generated anger among people , but it is clear that with the implementation of new technologies such as the internet the demand for a traditional postal service has fallen .
i can assure you , mrs frassoni , that the commission takes your points very seriously .
the first , which is the effect of the review of the common agricultural policy , increases production quotas gradually , and aims to lift them in 2015 .
another adverse factor is the rate of economic growth in the european union , which is slower compared to that of our international competitors .
lastly , mrs i n't veld and mrs stihler brought up the issue of more sophisticated programmes and more sophisticated instruments .
author . - madam president , what more can we say about burma that has not already been said , including calling again for the release of political prisoners like aung san suu kyi who has become a global icon in the struggle for freedom ?
we should deepen our reflection on the way the cohesion funds are currently implemented and coordinated on the one hand and , on the other hand , on the way they could be articulated for the next programming period after 2013 in order to keep a real coherent strategic development at regional level .
this week , at the committee on the internal market and consumer protection , we had an initial exchange of views regarding the report concerning names of textile products and related labelling , for which i am the rapporteur .
in writing . - consumer protection is of paramount importance to all member states .
this fund is utilised precisely where society needs it most , namely to help the affected people themselves .
the first is reverse qualified majority voting , which has already been referred to many times in this chamber .
i will support this report , but i think we must be realistic in what can be achieved with wind or wave energy , especially when matched up with the ever - increasing energy demands of the eu .
thirdly , the strategic objectives for renewable energy , namely the generation of 20 % of total energy from renewable sources and achieving a 20 % energy efficiency improvement by 2020 , are deserving of attention and support .
it is a shame that parliament still has not voiced any opinion on this crime , which was committed against me .
in many cases , then , what they say they want to do in the daytime is undone overnight .
we understand that and we have got to convey that message back to our member states so that they can exercise their subsidiarity to make sure that what we have been talking about here is actually put into practice .
the committee on foreign affairs does not consider it desirable to limit the new legal basis for the instrument to a few areas of cooperation .
the proposal that the energy production industry will have to purchase all its co 2 emission allowances by auction as from 2013 will cause a massive increase in energy prices that will be particularly painfully felt by the domestic economies .
in the same spirit , amendment 67 amounts to introducing competition between the national public health systems , as each person would be free , providing they pay , of course , to join the system of their choice in the eu .
i therefore agree with the opinion that all materials used in cosmetic products which have a carcinogenic effect should be banned .
in so doing , we must also take into consideration small - scale problems in wealthy member states .
this also means that the vat - based own resources should be abolished and , most importantly , that there must be no eu tax , regardless of its form , while the eu is not a truly representative democracy .
we badly need to introduce efficiency .
it demands full traceability of medicinal products and , at the same time , establishes an early warning system in all the member states , so that medicinal products which are suspected of being dangerous can be withdrawn .
i support the introduction of paternity leave , compensating such leave by analogy with maternity leave .
obscure procedures and the democratic deficit in the european union are causing mistrust among the citizens and exacerbating the crisis of confidence in the european institutions , as recently expressed in the extremely poor turnout at the european elections .
they have more to do with the ambitions of professional politicians and the people connected with them than with the interests of ordinary member state citizens .
whilst it is acceptable to question individual judgments , it is equally unacceptable to call into question the independence or legitimacy of the institution .
i do not support the tigers ' campaign of violence , and i consider it actually essential that the sri lankan army be permitted to continue their military campaign against the tamil tigers .
i do not contest this figure .
in these difficult economic times , it is very important that workers are able to earn overtime if they want to and that employers also have flexibility .
these are several of the reasons why i endorse this report .
then i would also like to note that we are now demanding that a number of countries ratify 27 ilo and un conventions and implement these in full .
in its mid - term report the commission said it was its opinion , just as commissioner dimas remarked , that the means cited in the mid - term review of the sixth community environment action programme would be enough to achieve this , but a study which has been undertaken on the commission 's current policy indicates otherwise .
there is an urgent need to increase the rate of development , and also to increase implementation of prevention , information , education and awareness campaigns , and to invest in research and development of new prevention and testing strategies , which must be kept up - to - date with changes in the nature of the pandemic .
volunteering is good for you , your community , your region 's economic development and your national economy .
we are told that it is the member states that must decide .
at this time of a real recession in the european union this is a stimulation package that - if we can get the money out to the right areas and if we can get it out in time - will make a real difference because we need to stimulate business .
we have always strived for a political solution involving all somali parties , and commissioner louis michel carried out a last - ditch peace mission to rescue the peace process prior to the ethiopian intervention in december 2006 and has been instrumental in linking eu support to the african union peace mission to somalia and to the launch of a genuine national reconciliation congress .
last week we had details of the commission 's important recovery plan , which i believe contains some very positive items , but i fear that this initiative alone may not deal with the immediate problems .
i consider it a good compromise that whether or not revenues from an airport 's commercial activities may be taken into account is left to the discretion of the member state in question .
i call upon the fisheries ministers to issue this decision very quickly , so that the fishermen in the outermost regions can acquire modern vessels that provide optimum safety conditions .
( nl ) mr president , amendment 86 in the martin report stipulates that the representative of the non - attached members at the conference of presidents be decided not by the non - attached members themselves but by the president of parliament .
as far as the basque country is concerned , work for peace , give support to the productive economy , push forward the basque high speed train , and integrate our fiscal system , our police and our language into the european institutions .
in this report , we do not only set out the policies we want to achieve .
as far as i am concerned , the most important thing is that this directive will contribute to ensuring that it is primarily treatment methods that cross the border .
we have our system of fiscal rules , the stability and growth pact , which must be properly implemented .
we had the year of folk culture , the month of the book , the month of the czechoslovak - soviet friendship , the cosmos week , the miners ' day .
for dialogue to be effective , to be transformative in bringing about core change in persons , it cannot be done on the basis of ' subject ' and ' object ' .
the report by hans - peter martin on behalf of the committee on budgetary control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the european railway agency for the financial year 2006 ( c 6-0387/2007 - ,
the european parliament amended the commission 's proposal pointing out the importance of respect for human rights , development policies , energy diversification , request for strategic documents , greater transparency of the eib policies and activities .
one of the most important achievements is the fact that we have succeeded in imposing on the council , even against its will , the fact that we have taken as our basic definition of pesticides the one that parliament , in the political agreement with the council , previously included in the directive on sustainable use .
pursuing this path is suicidal and will lead to the fragmentation of europe .
mr president , thank you very much for offering me this opportunity to offer my explanation of vote on the suspension of the doha round .
'4 .
a separate issue is the question of allowing genetically - modified agricultural production in the european market .
certainly , the implementation of european rules and penalty systems in relation to animal welfare must be improved to ensure that there is a satisfactory minimum standard of animal welfare in the european union .
it is important to me that the results of this sme test be subject to an independent evaluation by an independent body , and this idea has been incorporated into the text .
so , rather than using biofuels as a scapegoat , we must move to end agricultural protectionism and export restrictions ; we must move to enhance agricultural development in the poorest countries and to ensure the success of the doha development round to encourage free , fair and sustainable farm trade at global level .
not all the companies active in this area are multinationals ; there are many small companies too .
the eu could really do a lot about this : exchange of information , support and solidarity .
this is precisely the principle on which the parliamentary elections must take place .
secondly , i think that young people in particular are disadvantaged , and youth in my country , in ireland , are the most disadvantaged group ever because now they are landed with the big debt resulting from the banking crisis and , despite being highly educated , they have one choice only , to choose their ticket abroad if they want to work ; there are no jobs for them at home .
let me finish on the reality of the situation .
the presidency believes that the reason why it would be necessary for us to focus on other provisions of the directive , that is , chapters one and three , is that this is where we can create true european added value .
baroness ashton said that some progress has been made , and of course it has , but there are severe problems still .
fortunately , the paragraph explicitly mentioning the need to replace the pay - as - you - go system with capital - funded systems was rejected by a large majority in this house .
that is not actually an impossible task .
if it becomes selection , then it is no longer a positive policy .
it is extremely important that we understand that , for example , the mobile phones we hold in our hands in our daily lives , actually contain precious materials , from gold to platinum to rhodium , which are extremely important for the future .
the work they have done in this area has brought peace to many families .
politics and the army are being infiltrated by neo - nazis and racists .
that is why i do not have the details you are asking about .
in addition , an independent national commission of human rights is being set up .
the geographic environment of the countries situated in the more northerly parts of europe is vastly different from that of the southern ones .
an eu civil protection mechanism , a team of six experts , is also now in chile .
the framework directive will appear somewhere between autumn 2010 and spring 2011 .
now it could become underrated .
why submit a resolution that has already been submitted on many other occasions just when we are fortunately starting to get somewhere with the chinese government ?
in a globalised economy , the efficient and innovative use of energy , materials and resources is a key issue .
the union cannot continue to faithfully repeat past promises , such as that made to the western balkan states at the thessaloniki european council of 2003 that they would join the european union .
as you know , we must rebuild public finances on sustainable foundations .
would it not be better to improve the services provided in biarritz by introducing non - polluting forms of transport ?
from the current level of about 380 parts per million in the atmosphere , further co 2 increases will have a trivial effect .
i hope that , by adopting amendments , we can still make some improvements to this draft and actually do what is necessary , namely to formulate the sort of ambitious waste - management policy we need in the european union .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , yesterday evening , the lega nord delegation was the only political party which voted , in committee , against this resolution .
not a single member voted against it ; nor did anyone oppose it any of the committees that were asked for their opinion .
a european strategy to integrate the roma more effectively is a very important issue .
i am sorry , it is not possible .
i would like to know whether you think that it is not leading the european union to have negotiations going on at this moment with this house on the financial supervision package .
the reason for this is that nuclear incidents do not respect geographical borders .
it is high time that we thought about this problem and , in the future , adopted a different format .
i remain painfully aware of the situation of dhondup wangchen , the tibetan film maker , who suffers from hepatitis b and is in need of urgent medical attention in prison .
i would like to thank this parliament very sincerely for the extremely hard work and commitment it has shown in maintaining a high level of ambition on this issue .
to date , the kosovo issue has not been resolved because the international community has been unable to come to an agreement .
of course you have been supported by mr barroso on that .
the full implications of the current situation on our portfolio and on the development of our business cannot yet be clearly seen .
reiterates its call for an immediate end to all acts of violence ; '
acts of sea piracy represent a serious threat not only for human beings , but also for maritime safety .
however , we should also highlight the needs of the more vulnerable sections of the population , such as children , the elderly and the disabled .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , this has been a difficult report .
therefore , i think it is necessary to extend the period for choosing ground handling service providers .
mrs ask and i are looking forward to increased cooperation with the european parliament .
mr president , you said last weekend that you were not ready to put your european flag back in your pocket , and indeed we have seen that you have raised it under the arc de triomphe next to the french flag .
what are the energy sources ?
it is a vibrant country that has many intellectual , cultural and other depths , and we should like to see it commit itself to working with us in several areas , including energy , human rights , the middle east and nuclear energy .
as you all know , our cooperation with tajikistan is currently still governed by the trade and cooperation agreement concluded with the ussr in 1989 and endorsed by tajikistan in 1994 .
thank you for this good approach , which has enabled us to conclude this text and thus to bring a new quality to visa policy that will be very much appreciated .
european religious dialogue , the cultural tradition of religion and the tradition of religious instruction are also a resource that can be used in european policy .
the cost of regulation falls on the consumer and , in this case , the old - age pensioner .
however , the resale of atomic waste must be stopped .
madam president , mr tajani , mrs weiler , ladies and gentlemen , i am very pleased and proud to have contributed to the adoption of this directive on behalf of the committee on legal affairs .
stocks of tuna in the mediterranean sea are also gravely threatened .
unless we improve the morale of our fellow citizens , we will not restore consumer confidence , without which economic recovery will not be possible the information provided to our fellow citizens has to be balanced and honest and not encourage defeatism by hiding the progress , the successes and practical consequences of the recovery plans , whilst taking into account the timescales necessary for them to produce their effects .
is it really reasonable for the eu to use european taxpayers ' money in advertising campaigns to convince the same citizens that they should buy the goods that they have already subsidised ?
the validity of the trade preferences should not be terminated because this could have negative consequences on the overall economic performances of the western balkans , with consequent negative repercussions on their domestic reform and transition processes .
there is a differentiation according to the member states and greater account will be taken of inputs .
the report also notes a number of issues affecting the process of croatia 's integration into the european union .
more than a billion people are currently suffering from starvation .
this represents a considerable improvement over the narrower wording originally proposed by the rapporteur .
we must set out strict conditions to accompany the peace and development process in the middle east .
what we have achieved to date has therefore been primarily directed at settling these conflicts of interest , for we in the committee are of the opinion that such a regulation is needed and that every effort should be made to agree on one .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on economic and monetary affairs . - ( el ) mr president , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , i should like to convey our opinion to you .
in this respect , it would be desirable for national legislation transposing the directive to make provision for special training programmes for drivers of articulated buses .
it is a communication about our legislative activities in the near future - a communication concerning mutual relations between the european commission and the european parliament in the legislative process .
in spite of this huge effort , afghanistan is still the number one producer of narcotic drugs .
we probably all agree that it is essential to run an information campaign promoting the solvit network as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism .
i also welcome the support for and recognition of initiatives such as city - vitality - sustainability ( civitas ) and intelligent energy europe , which form the basis for this kind of programme .
i also support the ombudsman in his following primary objectives : to ensure that the european union 's citizens will enjoy the benefits and resources of the treaty of lisbon and to achieve better cooperation with national and regional ombudsmen , thereby ensuring greater transparency of activity at european level .
( nl ) first of all , i regret the fact that right now we are unable to paint a rosy picture of the political situation in bosnia and herzegovina .
each member state has constantly persisted in improving equal access to those who need it the most .
what is more , this somewhat contradicts your statement this morning in relation to sugar .
dates for next sittings : see minutes
that is the logical consequence of the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon .
i read with great interest and a strong sense of involvement the report tabled by mr brok and approved on monday in the committee on constitutional affairs .
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday 9 june 2011 .
eur 800 million have been made available for research into hydrogen technology , and not only for vehicles , in a joint technology initiative .
( de ) mr president , mrs malmström , we definitely do not need walls to resolve the asylum problem .
in writing . - i voted in favour , today , of motion for resolution on taxation of financial transactions , and am delighted that , for the first time , parliament has demanded an assessment of the feasibility and impact of introducing a financial transaction tax at eu level .
it is worth standing back and asking , ' what is the european investment bank for ? '
once this trade starts , it will expand very rapidly by virtue of its competitive advantage .
in this context , i think that the eu - mercosur association agreement is of paramount importance .
( sv ) madam president , now that the treaty of lisbon has been adopted and the eu 's charter of fundamental rights has become legally binding , we have a new opportunity to reinforce the social dimension of european cooperation .
i could quote a number of other examples .
i support all the efforts that have been made in this regard , which are restoring public confidence in the markets .
the verts / ale group also requests a procedure to vote out the commission - a vote of no confidence in the commission .
in copenhagen , china , india , the united states and other major powers each spoke with one voice , while europe spoke with many different voices .
of course , protection for human rights and our real solidarity with third countries are a top priority objective .
in amongst the ships that were being repaired and dismantled - and the noise , i have to tell you , was intolerable - there were whole families living , sleeping , cooking meals in shanty towns .
the few municipalities with facilities to accommodate the roma , for example , rezé and indre , located in the nantes conurbation , are stretched to the limit and lack the support of the public authorities .
the russian authorities are constructing stands , intended to be used for only 14 days during the olympics , on the location of the oldest part of the village .
the correct solution is : yes to stress tests , yes to supervision and no to demonising nuclear energy .
this is important for all partners , especially for business people .
i must , first of all , stress that this budgetary procedure is taking place at a time when we are emerging from an economic crisis , and , even if the european budget can and must help in emerging from this crisis , we must not lose sight of the considerable budgetary restraints that affect our national budgets .
these advances justify my vote in favour of the final text .
where does the integration of social and social sustainability objectives with macro - economic policy stop ?
i have always argued that the regional level is the most appropriate for stimulating research and innovation because it favours universities , public research bodies , large companies , small and medium - sized enterprises , and regional and local public authorities working closely together , specifically as clusters .
it takes a long time and i would not venture to give time frames , but let us remember that enlargement is a good european union policy , although it is a long - term one .
repeated amendments to tax legislation or changes to the conditions for accessing the various types of funds make it difficult for them to do business .
it is precisely in large companies that the worst kinds of animal abuse take place .
just for clarification to paolo de castro , intervention for cheese was actually abolished in 1994 .
the debate is closed .
i had prepared a lot of other things to say , but i must point out that we have certainly not achieved all we can here .
i should also say that , in the eu 2020 strategy , ' taxation ' or ' taxes ' is mentioned many times , which is in strong contrast with previous strategic documents .
( sk ) mr milinkevich , mr kozulin , i am delighted that you are here for today 's debate on your country , belarus .
furthermore , commissioner , you cannot be unaware that paternity leave already exists in the national legislation of many member states .
( fr ) mr president , the negotiations have highlighted the failure of the eu 's strategy , which was aimed at making others follow in its wake by being the most virtuous .
the people of southern sudan who lived and worked in the north , sometimes even owning property , have fled to the south in tens , even hundreds , of thousands .
we know all the excuses .
a solely military response cannot be enough , it is true .
draft general budget 2010 ( section iii ) (
all these issues must be tackled rigorously , systematically and positively , without raising doubts about the way that competition policy works .
this means that we are not in the business of giving a free ride to those who do not respect certain key principles .
( sl ) actually , it is strange that issues concerning the system 's operability should crop up time and again whenever we tackle these kinds of major and weighty technical questions .
in writing . - i back this report from the committee on agriculture and rural development on organic production and labelling on organic products .
at the same time , i would like to emphasise that i also believe a general redrafting of the gsp and gsp + schemes is needed .
in writing . - ( pt ) i voted in favour of this report highlighting the role of volunteering in contributing to economic and social cohesion in the eu .
an overall initiative is required .
it is on the great trading route of the silk road and has some of the best preserved islamic architecture sites , some of which are buried beneath the desert .
access to effective treatment for the disease is limited in many countries , and there is no coordination of treatment for aids and that for tuberculosis .
we need to take responsibility for them , just as we do all other indigenous peoples .
i am pleased the report passed without that paragraph .
in the new rule 36 , we must ' fully respect ' those rights as laid down in the charter of fundamental rights .
in writing . - given the tough austerity measures currently being taken across all member states , i believe that it is inappropriate to provide funding for a european house of history at this time , which is why i voted against this report .
what we need , therefore , is for all the european political groups that are in power to work together .
mr president , i would like to remind you that my group has decided not to take part in the vote for the reasons i mentioned earlier .
a common european strategy is obviously needed , but the european union will not get anywhere if it is acting alone .
objectives in those fields cannot be enforced at european level ; and rightly so .
the diversification must allow an indigenous development that would create stability and well - being in these regions .
it is a sad sight to see the member states lining up separately in order to be able to offer their citizens the prospect of a trip to the united states without a visa , in exchange for security measures that the americans could not negotiate with the union as such .
( bg ) madam president , i congratulate mrs oomen - ruijten for the fine job she has done .
i believe this is what the taxpayers of europe would expect of us .
in this directive , however , liability is limited to the first subcontractor level , which is something that we do not consider acceptable .
in writing . - ( sv ) africa is a continent in need of aid , stronger trade links and increased participation in the globalisation which is creating greater welfare for all .
however , the greatest disagreements concern the figures , of course .
and it is very cynical to portray the european financing of european election campaigns and all manner of european political foundations as a strengthening of european democracy .
in recent years , with the approaching olympic games in beijing , we have learned of other ' developments ' such as the fact that people 's accommodation is being demolished without compensation being awarded , in order to make way for the construction of olympic structures , and the existence of a list of 42 categories of people not to be allowed to attend the olympic games , including the dalai lama , his followers and human rights defenders .
are there any comments ?
yes , we also need to maximise the skills in our own member states , and that is why we support the amendment recalling , for example , the anti - discrimination legislation , which we also hope will be ambitious in its next stage .
but let us be also clear .
through the internet , all journalists can express themselves freely and get in touch with the public .
as we know , the decisions of the european central bank ( ecb ) are partly to blame for the crisis that we are experiencing .
but we also know that russia is a key partner in tackling regional conflicts and global challenges - also mentioned here - and that much remains to be done to develop the full potential of our relationship .
mr president , in times of economic stringency , faced with cuts in public spending right across european countries , all the eu 's institutions should be looking at how to cut costs and waste .
i am addressing the commission in order to ask it what it intends to do to end this injustice .
now , two years later , people are only grateful .
we would save a lot of time .
written statements ( rule 149 )
i voted for mr cashman 's report concerning the extent to which the millennium development goals set out in the year 2000 have been realised .
as such , while they do not replace the decision of whether or not to adopt a given solution , they can be decisive in shaping the choice of a given political solution .
waste management must be based on prevention , reuse , recycling , recovery and , lastly , disposal , and this hierarchy must be a guiding principle .
without transparency , we shall have a circle , but far from a virtuous one .
assistance is provided in the event of death , serious accident , serious injury , arrest , detention , assistance to be provided to victims of violent crime , and relief and repatriation of distressed citizens of the union .
i am in favour of the recommendation on the comprehensive revision of the convention on future multilateral cooperation in the northwest atlantic fisheries , inasmuch as it incorporates modern concepts on fisheries management .
one of the main arguments for reducing vat is that it will provide more favourable distribution of income after consumption , by reducing the cost of the shopping basket of low - income households and increasing that of high - income households .
universal access to high - speed access is largely dependent on this sharing of frequencies .
mr president , commissioner , the questions raised by the committee chair in this debate reflect global circumstances .
there is no response from the commission here .
i am grateful to mr juncker for pointing out that indirect taxation should not be increased but reduced whenever possible .
in writing . - i voted against the podimata report on innovative financing because it wants to introduce a financial transfer tax which , while it is claimed that it is needed to protect the economy from risky trading and to provide a fund to use in the event of another crisis , and will only be placed on wholesale and professional industry , it will inevitably be passed on to the consumer and citizen taxpayer who is already struggling in this crisis .
it will hinder the big flow of normal investments and trade that we are in need of .
after all , we have seen the present regime attempting to silence the legitimate political protest of students and journalists through arbitrary arrests and detentions .
the debate is closed .
turning to the questions you have asked concerning implementation : depending on the country , the choice will be made on the basis of criteria of effectiveness .
there will be lessons that we , too , must learn from this , however , namely that in emergencies the veneer of civilisation soon peels and that 24 hours can be too long .
this is very much in the hands of the member states .
a sensible thing that the coalition government can do is to stop throwing good money after bad .
this can only be achieved if adequate time is available for the stakeholders to respond , so i think that a maximum of nine months is not an exaggerated period .
so we cannot be careful enough with toys , but i am glad that we have sent this message now .
some questions remain unanswered , not all fears have been dispelled .
( fr ) mr president , my colleague , mrs de keyser , has had the opportunity to recall the tragedy that occurred in liège on 27 january .
we thus need to focus on human resources development and capacity building , with a special focus on young people , women , and minorities ; and on the development of more rational policies in small and remote villages , taking into account the existing local natural and human resources as well as people 's needs .
firstly , we are facing a crisis that was predicted .
producers have a right to expect parliament to put forward the radical measures they need .
we cannot develop a proper european immigration policy if we do not put an end to the imbalance that exists in the current treaties : the fight against illegal immigration has to be made part of a proper community system and the present all - round paralysis affecting our policy on legal immigration can no longer be tolerated .
contrary to what this report claims , africa and the european union do not currently share the same way of thinking about more democracy , good governance and human rights .
it is regrettable that this proposal , dating back to 2003 , and which aims to provide refugees with long - term resident status after five years of continuous legal residence , has not been implemented in the intervening period .
as europeans , we need to guard against protectionist practices , which are increasingly rearing their heads , mainly due to the poor situation with the world economy , but also under the banner of protecting food safety .
for this reason , the committee on international trade also points out some matters that were left out .
in writing . - ( ro ) i support the europe 2020 strategy promoting economic growth which is smart ( based on knowledge and innovation ) , environmentally friendly and conducive to social inclusion .
this kind of enduring intervention distorts the market ; an extremely dangerous game which , in a worst case scenario , could bring the entire global economy to its knees .
it could be said that the functioning of the european ombudsman provides the best indicator of computer use in the european union .
there is absolutely no disputing the fact that this will be our next target .
( pt ) in my speech today , in my own name and on behalf of the group i represent in this parliament , i would like to express deep sadness at the passing of fausto correia .
the distortion is even more serious if it is also based on the assumption that the state should help banks which are not able to pay their customers .
your contributions improve the text ; for example , the new deadline set for designing a national approach , an explicit reference to the involvement of local and regional authorities .
the first question i wish to ask myself in this respect is what cop conferences are in the first place ?
i repeat , including during this period .
it also reminds us of the need to support the real economy more than ever ; in particular , through an ambitious european industrial policy .
the debate is closed .
in writing . - ( pt ) kosovo has still not received unanimous recognition by the member states .
france is back in europe , you said on the evening of your election , and we do not doubt it for a minute : i would even say that we have not had a moment to doubt it , about which we are delighted .
i called , in fact i met , issaias and spoke to him about this issue .
i am therefore going to try to answer the various questions that have been put to me and try hard to group together the speeches , since several of them related to the same subjects .
the peoples of europe must intensify their struggle to finally reject the reactionary euro - constitution .
given the present gas crisis in europe , it must be underlined that belarus has proved a particularly stable partner as regards the transit of gas supplies to the european union .
a successful car industry is important to the union .
( the sitting was opened at 9.00 a.m. )
agreements on eliminating double taxation which are concluded bilaterally between member states in accordance with the aforementioned autonomous powers and consistent with the oecd sample agreement do not appear to be sufficient for eliminating all legal double taxation in the eu .
i believe that over 1.8 million smes benefited from loan guarantees in 2009 .
so let me trace some of the chequered history .
the negative impact of advertisements for foodstuffs with a high fat , sugar or salt content is very serious .
within this context , reducing the impact of transport on global warming will play a decisive role .
madam president , always with a smile on your face , commissioner , from the start of this term of the ep , if not before , we have had a very intensive and lively debate on the urgency of reforming the eastern and southern dimensions of the european neighbourhood policy .
in writing . - ( es ) i voted against this report : it is a very delicate topic as it affects more and more people , and the fact that it is being treated as a logistical rather than a human problem is intolerable .
with confidence in the financial markets at a low and the banking sector in disarray , is the council working to tackle the crisis and restore confidence by implementing a coherent and combined approach , or is it felt that member states are better prepared to manage the financial turmoil unilaterally ?
the process of building a stable political system must continue .
bahrain is at risk of becoming the site of a confrontation between iran and saudi arabia .
it is perfectly clear that , in this european union , the prize for national betrayal is a high one indeed .
in other words , the final accounts for 2008 present a true and fair view , although due attention should be paid to addressing weaknesses in the systems of a number of directorates - general of the commission .
who decided that , madam president ?
in addition , as already stated , the european commission has adopted a six - year strategic development plan for chile for 2007-2013 , which makes provision for the take - up of community resources by this latin american country for regional and sectoral programmes being undertaken by the country 's recently - elected government .
in my view , the application of the package will enable us primarily to ensure the following .
european citizens want a union that works .
it continues to foster close links with terrorist organisations even to this day .
mr president , the board in this meeting room shows that today 's topic is called innovative financing .
( de ) madam president , the hedge fund regulation is not a consequence of the crisis .
i also do not see only the threat of climate change but also very much the opportunity to drive forward business and the economy through developing ultra - modern technology .
in writing . - ( pt ) it is true that the long - term consequences of gmo technology are still unknown .
on behalf of the alde group . - ( de ) madam president , mrs yade , mr vice - president of the commission , today , we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the sakharov prize , and last week saw the 60th anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights - and these two events have never been so relevant .
i voted against the council 's annual report to parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy ( cfsp ) in 2008 , because i think that the objective of the cfsp should be to define the eu 's external policy , not defend its territory .
it also shows that the eu is on the right track in improving its relationships with this continent , which has a larger population than the eu - 27 .
where is europe ?
political personalities like the french and spanish european commissioners will founder here .
( it ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to thank the rapporteur , mrs muscardini , and all the shadow rapporteurs with whom i have worked on this issue , which is extremely important for us .
i think it is important that we focus on improving trade agreements to create wealth in these countries , including india , and help them out of poverty .
it is not necessary to buy cds from switzerland ; there is another way to go about this .
those of you who understand the european union and know the early warning system also know how the early warning system works .
on the subject of neighbours , if turkey joined europe , we would have iran , iraq and syria as our neighbours .
there is still the need to simplify at member state level .
she did not want to , but she needed to in order to keep the family together .
south africa is a country that is developing rapidly in all areas and with which the european union wishes to foster a special relationship .
would the commission not accept the spirit of that decision , which was made here just last month by the elected members of this parliament ?
this historic breakthrough , if it is confirmed in this house tomorrow , signals a victory for europe as a partner , in other words for european institutions that have worked hand in hand with the member states in a spirit of cooperation and with a strong common will to succeed .
i would like to express the hope that this time the european commission will approach the task of preparing a common energy policy more seriously .
the european council has decided that it can only appoint new commissioners when there is legal clarity on the treaty , and we have not yet completed this process .
therefore , it is particularly important that we do not base our framework programme on the lowest , weakest standards .
in this strong europe , we will probably have to dispense with the expression ' improving coordination ' , as it means that everything is dependent on the subjects that have to be coordinated and inevitably leads to paralysis and a lack of clarity .
there is evidence that several of these flights were carrying prisoners from the incirlik base in turkey to guantanamo , including the ' bosnian six ' .
mr president , i welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate today and want to address a very specific issue that has already been raised by some of the colleagues that i have listened to .
in this regard , i would like , once again , to call on the other two institutions , the commission and the council , to give this matter top priority in the next financial perspective .
this information is not easy to control on the internet , but sooner or later we have to deal with that problem , which will not disappear if we simply do not do anything because it is too complicated .
the recent incident related to the declaration of independence by kosovo showed a lack of unity among the member states in terms of opinion and , on the same grounds , it is likely that the same diversity of opinion will be shown when the matter under discussion is the situation of our extra - community neighbours .
so we restored the present summer time regime , turning the clock twice a year .
we ought to take the following measures to end the crisis in this sector : extend the measures envisaged for storing butter , milk powder and cheeses , speed up the creation of a dairy product fund to meet the needs of small producers and young farmers , and reach an understanding with the supermarkets in terms of setting a fair price for both agricultural producers and retailers .
for most victims , crime has various psychological and moral repercussions that continue long after the crime has been committed .
this sharing of information empowers and strengthens national parliaments .
in fact , it needs to be able to react as quickly as possible , because the precise philosophy of the solidarity fund is to cover emergencies or part of the emergencies caused by disasters .
i am actively looking at whether we can provide additional funding in all of these areas .
if we are in agreement , and if we have a clear and constructive dialogue , it will be good for russia , it will be good for the eu and it will be good for many pertinent issues in the european and the global arena .
i would remind those of you who have not had the opportunity to speak that , if you wish , you can submit a written statement not exceeding 200 words which will be annexed to the verbatim report of proceedings , should you wish to keep a record of what you wanted to say if you had been able to do so .
it should thus be said strongly , and said here , and said by this parliament : fascist intolerance has nothing to do with the war on terrorism !
this has never happened in history .
it goes without saying that this report must not provide an opportunity for data abuse .
you will soon receive a number of proposals from parliament on how the directive might be improved .
that , of course , is a matter for the iranians .
likewise , we could say that , fortunately , the rumours surrounding the un climate process have been shown to be greatly exaggerated .
these are all concerns that have been relayed by many meps , who do not wish to place ' blind ' confidence in the negotiations conducted by the european commission .
i firmly support this simplified regime since third country nationals holding a visa issued by another member state who would benefit from this system , have already been subject to a strict screening process in that member state and were not considered a threat to public order or a risk in terms of illegal immigration .
the council and commission have noted that japan 's capacity to remove regulatory barriers to trade is a precondition for launching negotiations on the eu - japan free trade agreement ( fta ) , thus fostering closer economic integration between the two strategic trading partners .
the time has come for europe to set institutional questions aside and dedicate itself to what really matters to the 500 million europeans : the social market economy , energy , the climate and security .
the 2003 and 2004 reforms were important stages in the reformation of the common agricultural policy ( cap ) .
president of the commission . - my clear answer is no : what we have done is not sufficient .
it is time to walk the walk .
my third point concerns the cooperation with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
in relation to non - eu countries in which a growing need for energy can be observed , the european union ought to ensure that technology relating to renewable energy sources is supplied to them on preferential terms .
the report also targets the adoption of a white paper on territorial cohesion , which would be a real step forward for the eu towards a new multi - level governance that ingrates perfectly with european , national and regional competences .
currently , it is being used mainly to target people who are victims of political persecution .
the council and commission must continue their efforts on devising recovery strategies in cooperation with the european parliament and member states by implementing the european economic recovery plan .
the oral question to the commission by gabriele albertini and arnaud danjean , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , on the non - proliferation treaty - b 7-0010/2010 ) .

the commission did not lend much support to this proposal , and included a watered - down version of it in its text .
that is why i supported mr andersson 's report , which proposes maintaining guidelines for employment policies in 2009 .
in conclusion , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr karl - heinz florenz , on the openness he has shown in our work .
first of all , i would like to remind everyone that our decision expressly states , and reiterates , that we have put our support for upgrading on hold , and i very much hope that we will not merely carry on as if nothing has happened just because the presidency says so .
as a strictly precautionary measure , all farms were blocked ; their commercial activities suspended ; there were laying hen , fattening poultry , goose , pig , dairy cattle , bovine and rabbit farms .
the new challenge is to face the global world in which there are ever more people consuming and producing , where borders are disappearing and no european country is really a world player .
since , in a huge number of cases , we need to react immediately when the complicated european legislative mechanism does not work , when the council and parliament cannot meet , and in this case there is no other alternative than to authorise the commission in such matters in the interests of rapid , effective action .
let us tell it like it is .
it is very good that existing strengths are being built on by means of ' active and healthy ageing ' - actually , healthy living rather than healthy ageing - and it would seem that , in fact , healthy ageing begins at conception .
we also adopted amendments 198 to 202 on the inclusion of aviation - as mentioned by mr groote - and marine transport .
not only the commission , but member states , too , must take measures to simplify the red tape involved with the common agricultural policy .
it is this philosophy that consists in using chemicals for everything , in causing a cocktail effect and in taking a short - term view of agriculture that is today being called into question .
the european union is lost today between bilateral agreements , conformity , and a diversity which should be our asset , not a hindrance .
according to information from the world health organisation , falsified medicines account for around 50 % of products offered on the internet .
this is a fundamental issue in particular , but not solely , for environmental policy .
the purpose of this report is to establish parliament 's preliminary position with regard to a new financing instrument for eu development cooperation ( dci ) , based on the previous regulation .

mr marinescu , i have praised the excellent work of the portuguese presidency , which has allowed new member states to join the system .
- thank you , mrs harms .
the planned inventory , which will include maps , will be a necessary source of information for everyone .
the european commission deeply appreciates the rationale of this proposal in the motion for a resolution .
i shall be back here again tomorrow to discuss the document that we presented to the last european council , and to the community at large , on bringing added value to europe and on the means for shaping globalisation to best effect .
not only aid but trade was the answer , as a short - term measure to assist .
concerning climategate , the commissioner said : ' the european commission 's position is that it does not affect the obvious and justified conclusions contained in the ipcc report . '
written statements ( rule 149 )
this will particularly benefit portuguese migrants in other community countries who will in the future enjoy a wide range of rights and obligations , including equal treatment with regard to nationals of the host state .
an oral question - b 6-0378/2007 ) concerning the rise in foodstuff prices and consumer protection by sergio berlato , janusz wojciechowski , gintaras didžiokas and liam aylward , on behalf of the uen group to the commission .
this is what we called ' fortunate campania ' - oh dear !
it is on this dual basis and under the pressure of dramatic external events - i am not going to talk about the attacks that have troubled us so much and which have caused so many deaths and tragedies - that a number of policies have made spectacular progress : the fight against terrorism and serious crime , the fight against illegal immigration , the fight against racism and xenophobia , and the fight against drugs and drug addiction .
i believe that all in this parliament would agree that the best protected consumer is only the informed consumer .
i call on the commission to take special measures to prevent this horrible crime , and also to punish the perpetrators .
in the first place , i would like to congratulate my fellow member , mr siwiec , on the excellent work that he has done and on the collaboration , or , better , the synthesis of ideas that we have achieved , on the general principle of the revision of the european neighbourhood policy ( enp ) .
this situation is in need of change .
the public is therefore asking us to manage the resources allocated to us properly , and make savings whenever possible .
new energy policies , particularly within the context of the general crisis , must not lose sight of economic efficiency and must not , in any way , jeopardise the economic sustainability of european nations , without this meaning poorer environmental performance .
35 .
but this need is not merely a matter of financial investment .
this is also a very good instrument that we have in addition to mere dialogue .
it is good that parliament is trying to speak as one , although these words are at times inept and sometimes reveal great incompetence .
you have our support .
mr schwab raised the question of a uniform approach to damages , which is a very valid question for all of us .
it is good to be optimistic , but we cannot be optimistic about iraq as things stand at the moment .
countries are quarrelling and negotiating about how the seabed might be divided up .
if we move towards a purely eu defence mechanism , then it will be mostly britain and france who share that burden , while others hide behind it .
it may have been possible - i do not know - if we had been able to discuss these three years into his term of office , because many interesting suggestions were made .
until now , in practice , we have not witnessed the application of this clause except in the case of france , which offered to take 80 asylum seekers from malta .
we therefore hope that good results will come out of the conference .
i voted for the resolution on labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency .
i refer in particular to croatia and the numerous italian expatriates who continue to be clearly discriminated against in that country , despite croatia 's official application for admission to the eu .
( da ) mr president , i should like to dispute a most fundamental premise , namely the premise that dividing ourselves into fewer groups gives us more political coherence .
inward migration from third countries cannot solve the difficulties demographic change poses for the eu , but it can help .
this states that the igc decision of 19th october 2007 incorporating children 's rights as one of the objectives of the eu in the treaty of lisbon provides a new legal basis for children 's rights .
( pl ) madam president , in recent years , thousands of burmese have left their country for fear of repression by the ruling military regime and because of the spreading hunger , seeking refuge in thailand or in neighbouring countries of south - east asia .
that is what we do not want , and we therefore support this report .
extradition - procedures for which are defined in a bilateral agreement - should have been granted .
what is this force going to do ?
why should our garden tables be made of wood from the rainforest and why are exotic parquet floors better than floors made of eu wood ?
if we are going to speak of the holodomor , as they propose , we should also talk about the extermination of the indians in the new world by the colonists .
so it is quite wrong - a deceit in fact - for the eu to try and justify its involvement in military matters by claiming the comprehensive approach somehow rather for itself - some sort of eu - unique selling point .
this is the number one political issue .
however , the work has been going on in systems , it has not been going on within the culture that operates within the european commission .
in writing . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to confirm my vote for the resolution on the maritime labour convention , 2006 ( procedures relating to social dialogue ) .
we must have a system that earns the right to be called a european supervisor , and this system should align itself with that of the european central banks .
finally , the question on all our minds is who should foot the bill ?
to come out of the economic crisis and to create new jobs , we need more than ever a strong , independent and innovative commission .
( hu ) we can only stop climate change if we also stop deforestation .
is this cause to turn our backs on minsk again ?
however , the text adopted today also contains rules that would heavily burden companies without increasing consumer protection .
in the franco - german proposal , i see the real danger of ending up in a situation where the stronger countries will have greater leeway , and where greece will be unable to go beyond certain limits .

on the basis of the data collected when assessing the application of the regulation , the commission must draw up a set of indicators to determine to what extent each member state will collaborate with the commission and with the other member states , by providing them with the available information and the help required to correct fraud .
the majority in parliament has said nothing about these facts .
in my modest experience , however , use of this exceptional instrument rarely meets the criteria laid down in the interinstitutional agreement .
among other things , it should also be pointed out that it was obviously high unemployment that triggered the ' automatic stabilisers ' , which resulted in unemployment aid and subsidies .
the problems caused by financial activity in recent years were due to rule books being either torn up or ignored by those whose job it was to enforce them .
the content is limited and pessimistic . there are not enough concrete objectives and more of them are needed .
mr mitchell quite rightly highlighted the millennium development goals .
practically everything you have said , the commission has already proposed .
it is immoral and dangerous for us to encourage the brain drain from developing countries without taking into account the risk of the boomerang effect and without showing any concern for the discrimination taking place , whereby the majority of immigrants are offered jobs below their level of qualifications , especially women , making them all victims of the negative stereotypes and practices in the country of origin and of those in eu member states .
implementation of the fuel quality directive ( debate )
facts are facts and these agreements have been negotiated primarily by the directorate - general for trade and within this parliament the committee on development seems to me to have been somewhat sidelined .
these reactors are powered by a fraction of the critical mass of fissile material , which means that the occurrence of a spontaneous nuclear chain reaction is impossible .
that is crucial if we want our smes to flourish within a healthy competitive environment .
has the commission thought , at the very least , to draw up an impact assessment to judge the social and economic consequences of cutting funds ?
however , such massive decisions would require courage and strength from our politicians .
thus , this is also a difficult task .
before i finish , i would like to wish all members , our fantastic committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs , the president and commissioner barrot a merry christmas and a happy new year .

i understood correctly that this house is very committed to this very important matter and sees it as one of the most important challenges , if not the most important , for our generation .
poverty can only be reduced on a permanent basis by means of economic growth that is fair , sustainable and properly supervised , growth that is the result of commercial activity stimulated by market access .
the basis for doing so is guaranteed by the new treaty on the functioning of the european union , the treaty of lisbon , a recently elected parliament and the new commission now being formed .
one of them is the question of the illegal takeover of companies by ukrainian partners .
for the sake of fiscal integrity and for public accountability , they must now show more resolve and so , for those reasons , and until we see real progress being made by council in this matter , i and my colleagues in the british conservative delegation will vote against discharge of the 2007 general budget .
a year later , the committee on agriculture and rural development , which i have the honour to chair , is here to ask the commission to implement all relevant initiatives to resolve this long - standing problem , which can also have consequences for human health .
a lot has happened since the last european council , not least the recent events in ireland .
the dumping and the subsidisation were investigated on the basis of complaints by the company concerned and , according to the basic regulations , complainants can withdraw their complaints .
mrs haug said quite rightly that many of us were optimistic when awaiting the results of this communication , and we genuinely expected that they would bring a revision of the current financial framework to the table .

how can we negotiate an agreement with the palestinians , egypt and israel to change this situation ?
your holiness , patriarch bartholomew , it is a great honour to welcome you to this formal sitting of the european parliament during the european year of intercultural dialogue 2008 .
i voted for this resolution as it identifies the next stages which will enable the european union to continue along this path , strengthens the positive interaction between trade and climate protection and the tools ensuring consistency between trade and climate , and encourages fair international trade prices , thereby avoiding carbon leakage .
secondly we must retain historical awareness as part of european education .
those are the words of the unfpa , not mine .
there is a lot of work to be done and i will be very grateful for your support in developing this policy area .
we are on the edge of a financial collapse endangering the achievement of the goals undertaken by the eu , both for the 27 member states and for the other countries on our planet .
my third remark is that i am looking forward to a discussion with honourable members on the neighbourhood package , where we could also discuss the question of whether the concept ' as close as possible to the european union ' needs to have some institutional definition .
in particular , the present treaty does not provide for a mechanism similar to the infringement procedures for community legislation , in order to monitor the implementation of the instruments in member states ' legislation .
this is an effective and workable solution and we will vote in favour .
that is the policy of the dollar to which the ecb is not mounting an effective response .
there is no instruction manual on how to create the perfect monetary union , and nor can any absolute value be put on the knowledge acquired until now , since the socio - economic peculiarities of the euro area are liable to make any comparisons meaningless .
for example , amendment 141 .
we are faced with an agreement that serves the objectives of liberalisation within the air services sector , with the justification , as in other cases , that the 2002 ruling of the eu court of justice deems existing bilateral agreements contravene union law .
single market act ( debate )
if we look at the debate in the council , it is quite obvious that those countries which expressed most reservations about the solution found are among those with the worst economic performance .
this report follows on from the pension counter - reform put forward by nicolas sarkozy and his government , which the french protest movement has been fighting against and condemning for several weeks now .
here , we are merely talking about a form of temporary residence permit , after which you do not know whether or not you will be sent back to the place from which you have been trafficked .
i would just like to highlight three points here that i feel are priorities .
this is considered to be a bureaucratic requirement by the administrations of certain member states , but it should be viewed differently .
you , of all people , know that member states , social partners and trade unions stick to their labour law acquis .
we need not only to develop strong partnerships , but also to coordinate with other donors and have projects that should put words into action as far as the protection of the environment is concerned .
it should be recalled that the objective of the fund is to repair infrastructure and act as a refinancing tool , and not to compensate private damages .
i appeal to the sense of responsibility of the italian government to ensure it adopts all measures available to it , and call on the european commission to implement the measures provided for in the eu directive on temporary protection for immigrants .
i would like to congratulate mrs. gurmai for her report and i am convinced that , due to her as well , the roadmap to be drafted by the commission in the autumn of 2008 , for speeding up the introduction of incentives for intelligent cars , will be more ambitious .
the european institute of innovation and technology will make an important contribution to the transfer of technology from science to industry and to enterprises .
the question of common defence policy , something which touches upon the very essence of sovereign powers , has historically always been a matter of distrust for european countries and even today it deserves particular care , and quite justifiably so .
everyone knows the true picture !
on this occasion , the rising price of agricultural raw materials was highlighted , particularly its impact on consumers in the developing countries - my fellow members have spoken about this at length - but also on the populations of poor countries , which import cereals .
the directive will impose on member states a requirement to conduct regular inspections of equipment used professionally for pesticide application , and also a requirement to establish a system for regular maintenance and periodical inspection of equipment .
it is right and proper that today , 13 years after barcelona , we should be devoting so much time to the vital mediterranean dimension of our european policy .
the member states have eur 75 billion at their disposal for the period 2007-2013 .
many have not yet really sensed that they belong to a minority , but i hope they will feel this more and more , including the states .
transfers of money between donor and recipient are unacceptable .
there are major imbalances there , too .
in parliament we have been watching the situation and have on many occasions debated the consequences of a prolonged crisis caused by the breakdown in the operation of institutions , the inability to elect a president of the republic , the economic impasse resulting from occupation of the commercial and administrative centre , and fear of terrorist attacks .
today , there are already hybrid cars on the market , and the hybrid model works for both electric and hydrogen vehicles : hydrogen with methane , and the others with traditional diesel or petrol components .
can you also envisage using this money for similar projects ?
i therefore argue that the eu must make every effort towards greater investment in the areas of research , treatment and education , so as to improve this situation .
in writing . - i abstained in the votes on the rangel reports and .
we often have problems implementing european internal market legislation .
we need a vision of a market economy .
we therefore need to think again , particularly in relation to milk quotas , in countries such as italy which have for 20 years already been suffering this tragedy of a deficiency of production , despite having significant potential .
in fact , i believe that a differentiated approach would have risked exacerbating the ethnic and political divisions characteristic of the region .
this will be achieved through training of individual persons dealing with asylum applications and through exchange of information and best practices .
he headed a good and fair negotiation and i think that the result can be seen for itself .
radioactive contamination is transboundary in nature .
while i am delighted that this text emphasises the cap 's crucial role in achieving the objective of food security , i regret that the rapporteur is in favour of aligning agricultural policy more with the market and that she accuses environmental protection initiatives of being responsible for a reduction in agricultural production within europe .
madam president , few of us will dispute the importance of having long - term sustainability of commercial fish stocks .
this is how european integration proceeds : in fits and starts and in small steps .
mrs ashton has not come , today .
i want european cooperation at intergovernmental level .
i have always maintained that we need confident and satisfied consumers in the eu in order for the internal market to operate properly .
i would also still like to respond to mr davies , concerning his very concrete question .
europe has a highly developed quality control system that mainly relates to the state of animal health .
this was a very special event .
this would , i believe , make for a ' win - win ' situation in terms of employment , innovation , competitiveness and the environment .
we concern ourselves with violations of human rights in various places around the world , and yet such regrettable developments are taking place right here in the european union .
mr president , it is welcome news that the association of southeast asian nations has established a regional human rights commission .
vice - president of the commission . - mr president , i would like to thank all the honourable members for their positive and kind words concerning the commission 's work programme .
the next item is voting time .

soon , the cross - border mergers directive , which will enter into force in december , will give all limited liability companies , including smes , the option to transfer their registered office .
europe and japan are facing common challenges in terms of economic growth and sustainable development , so the conclusion of this agreement is worth celebrating , as it allows for the enhancement of their cooperation in the area of science and technology , with considerable advantages for both parties .
6 .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr liberadzki , for his constructive input in the preparation of the report .
more effective and streamlined regulatory and legal frameworks will deliver eu - wide improvements in social and economic outcomes , generate more jobs and improve our quality of life .
this is all good news , ladies and gentlemen .
these companies , which benefit the european economy , have , until now , not been subject to any supervision or specific regulations at european level .
each member state will be able to organise its own national system as it sees fit , for example by choosing whether to have one or more competent authorities .
however , i would say to you , mr schulz , when i get up in this place , i always research very thoroughly what i say .
we would like to support her during the discussions within the commission and with everyone else involved .
we have examples set out in the treaty when the eastern german länder benefited from such aid .
with a total of 25 million km2 we have the largest sea area in the world .
this problem has grown to such an extent that it can be called a new form of slavery .
not one of them has been omitted .
in the current world situation , where the price of oil and other energy sources - gas , for example - is rising steeply but is subject to unpredictable swings that make it difficult to plan sensibly and estimate investment costs and when the energy demands of european countries are also rising , a report on the subject of biogas would appear to be an unusually timely document .
in order to encourage bicycle riding , especially in urban areas , member states should include special routes for cyclists into any variant of building the road transport infrastructure , which would avoid as much as possible crossing with the main drive routes .
furthermore , it is essential for the european commission , as a member of the interim haiti recovery commission and , in view of its financial contribution , to intervene with a view to speeding up the implementation of the latter 's mandate and to making provision for its operation .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see minutes
this sector is working with increasingly scarce resources , receives increasingly low prices , and is faced with significant competition from third countries , which definitely distort the market .
we need to re - educate and train our workforce to be able to take up these jobs .
however , i should like to say one thing : when the crisis assumes proportions such as we have seen , a meeting of the ministers of finance alone is no match for the seriousness of the crisis .
the eqf will relate the countries ' different national qualification systems to each other , acting as a translation device .
i regard it as vital for legislation to prohibit direct and indirect discrimination , multiple discrimination and discrimination by association based on gender , race or ethnic origin , religion or belief , disability , age or sexual orientation or gender in a range of areas such as social protection , education and access to and supply of goods and services , such as housing , transport , telecommunications and health .
you just heard what the previous speaker said ; we often see that when you go too far too fast , you achieve the opposite of what you were actually trying to achieve .
we must bear in mind that the legal situation is , of course , complicated by the fact that we are dealing , in part , with international waters and , in part , with waters belonging to the member states .
this takes up a great deal of space and energy , harms air quality and causes an unnecessary amount of noise .
i fully support the suggestions included in the proposal for a resolution which we are going to vote on , on thursday .
europe today has just 2.7 % of the muslim population .
the rapporteur also points out that as the ultimate goal is human health protection , a more consistent approach is required for the risk analysis and control of residues of pharmacologically active substances , which may appear in food produced in or imported into the european union .
for this reason , i support the introduction of the two annexes to the directive .
i would like to repeat what i said in my introduction : i remain committed to the principle of maintaining a balance and complementarity between the two pillars of the common agricultural policy .
secondary services such as wireless microphone systems must not be endangered , for such systems are responsible for major transmissions of events such as the olympic games .
on the weber report , i would like to say that i think illegal immigration should be considered as ipso facto presenting the possibility that people will abscond .
as far as taxation of the financial sector is concerned , we have again started from a basic and commonly accepted premise : that , even though it was basically responsible for the crisis , even though it generated and , despite the crisis , continues to generate excessive profits , the financial sector is under - taxed , because it is exempt from value added tax almost across the board .
these two groups are the most vulnerable and the most susceptible to violence or sexual abuse and it would therefore be very positive if a decisive step were taken on this matter at the upcoming ilo conference .
our aim in establishing the european aviation safety agency , or rather in extending its remit , is to forge ahead with a small but important regulatory package .
under no circumstances can he be -
as part of our preparatory work , the commission is exploring the idea of candidate countries joining the initiative after 2019 .
we are deeply concerned about the daily living conditions of the gazan people : since the january conflict , donors have not been able to do reconstruction work and serious issues persist like the lack of clean drinking water .
even before the last developments , the commission , together with frontex , started to identify what can be done in the short and medium term .
progress is being made .
the first requirement is that all these agreements include clauses compelling european investors to behave responsibly abroad in economic , social and environmental matters .
the risk of a wide gap is quite real .
as our rapporteur points out , we must not lose sight of the goals of the process or of the notion of students being at the heart of all questions concerning their education .
i think that we must reconstruct the link , nowadays increasingly weak and fragile , between agricultural produce and food for everyday consumption ; that is to say , we must encourage consumers to be knowledgeable about the principles of a healthy diet and the seasonality of produce .
i think there is one good thing here : that we are all interested in research and know that it is europe 's and the member states ' only hope .
in romania , more than 6 000 redundancies will be made in the rail transport sector during this period .
this change is necessary in order to protect weaker eurozone economies .
( applause )
it is also important that , where member states have poorly functioning control mechanisms , this be made known so that farmers and the organisations representing their interests are able to call those authorities to account if they suffer damage as a result .
the report presents scientific findings with a 60-70 % probability as proven facts .
the member states should significantly increase the emphasis on gender equality in social dialogue .
africa represents an important source of raw materials for china .
it is not always easy .
furthermore , by highlighting the need for specific measures in the area of human resources in science and technology and the reinforcement of measures in the area of the information society , the portuguese presidency also hopes to bolster the favourable conditions for an increased research , development and innovation effort across the european union .
i am persuaded that how we view abortion is our own internal matter .
mr reinfeldt , mr barroso , on climate change , too , europe is showing a sense of responsibility .
history has shown that every financial crisis is followed by a technological shift .
emergency aid in the short term must be backed up with longer - term aid to help the future generations recover from this most horrific ordeal .
like all my colleagues , in approving this motion for a resolution i express my deepest sympathy to the japanese people who , with a great sense of civil responsibility , are reacting as best they can to the disaster .
in fact , the increase in obesity among children is quite alarming in europe .
i welcome the extension of the un mission in sudan and the deployment of additional peace - keeping forces because it is now particularly important to ensure the peaceful development of sudan and south sudan .
the european commission must allocate funds for research in this area .
41 .
although the court approved this management , it still has some shortcomings that need to be addressed .
the european union is an ideological project being forced upon european peoples who would rather live in democratic nation states .
i agree with the position of parliament that this european union strategic objective should also be pursued by cooperating closely with national governments , social partners and civil society , and that the european parliament should be involved to a greater extent in its execution .
the reaction of france and the french government was justified and proper , and our position should be equally resolute and severe .
at the time , i proposed , firstly , the creation of a solidarity fund and , secondly , the creation of a european civil protection force .
i might also add , on this issue , that i do not believe that the proposal to refer the buffer - zone matter to the various national arbiters is a satisfactory solution .
we also need to bring forward the deadline for a passive house standard for residential and non - residential buildings across europe .
but my vote comes reluctantly and with anger .
if the funds acquired in this way were distributed fairly , every citizen of the european union , including children and pensioners , would have eur 500 more in their wallet every year .
we must be true to ourselves and take a global approach to these issues .
i also welcome the endorsement of several of the previous speakers , my distinguished colleagues , who have committed themselves to promoting a new european vision for the black sea region .
we will vote tomorrow for the opening of the chapters on fundamental rights and judiciary and on the common foreign and security policy , not because we want to be weak on these issues , but because we want to be strong .
the commission and the member states manage taxpayers ' money badly and illegally .
farmers need the support of the european union in order for their businesses to succeed , and the european union , in turn , needs farmers in order to maintain an agricultural model that is capable of providing sufficient food of sufficient quality to its increasingly demanding citizens .
( el ) mr president , without doubt , we need a common immigration policy and we need to reinforce our cooperation with third countries and make it more cohesive and effective .
voting time
mr bonde , who makes such a racket here , was determined to be there at the signing of the treaty .
when the commission included in the recovery plan not only a fiscal endeavour but also ten priority actions for smart investments , what we were looking for was more growth , more sustainability and better quality employment than can be provided by some short - term measures .
in the long term , this measure could even turn out to herald a form of european accreditation guaranteeing high technological and personal standards .
i am pleased that the swedish presidency and mr kallas have demonstrated they have the commitment to resolve this problem .
what exactly did we achieve by way of this law ?
this makes co 2 from vehicle exhausts 15 times more expensive than that which is emitted from chimneys .
what follow - up will there be on those safety assessments ?
we have got to ensure in fact that this is not a deterrent to eu passengers going to the united states , because if we do not solve this particular problem it will be a major deterrent .
at that time they were in deep trouble .
( ro ) according to the european commission 's report in october 2008 on implementing the barcelona objectives and the care framework for pre - school children , member states have not met the objectives set by european union leaders .
i am convinced that both institutions will closely study the legislative proposals which the commission is to present at the informal session in slovenia in may , and that we will have an interesting debate at that session .
the fact that it mostly concerns women and children makes this immense business all the more inhumane .
therefore , we must all make efforts to ensure that the egyptian - french plan to institute an international mechanism to secure gaza 's borders will be a success and it must , of course , be dependent as a priority upon a cessation of the smuggling of arms and rockets into the gaza area .
these are elements that will be reflected not only in the reform of the cap , but also in other initiatives that the commission will propose .
this proposal , which we will hopefully adopt tomorrow , is a good start towards finally putting an end to the distortion of competition that has existed for many years , particularly in the border regions ; it is also good for the environment .
with regard to the comments from mr radwan and others on the financial crisis , clearly we are taking action to protect citizens , to protect savers , and to ensure that those responsible for the crisis in the various institutions have to pay for it .
mr president , i have been in burma and seen the misery and the oppression under which the burmese people live .
i do not plan to measure the success of the summit by the length of the final joint declaration .
madam president , thank you for your words of welcome , and thank you to every one of you for your good wishes and your encouragement .
all the more reason for providing appropriate work and safety conditions for just these workers .
he will surely give top priority to assessing and quantifying the damage and planning the massive effort that will be needed .
the egf can and should be streamlined so that victims of collective dismissal do not have to wait 17 months for support which is declared to be urgent , as they have in this case .
this is in the interests of all member states , but it is especially important for hungary , which at present is reliant solely on russian gas .
we will hit the ceiling in the multi - annual agreement for the budget in three headings , namely 1a for research , education and transport and heading 3b for legal policy , and we will go beyond the ceiling in heading 4 , foreign policy .
there is also the concept of smart meters and the imposition of a deadline for their roll - out , namely 10 years after the entry into force of the directive .
the european budget is different from national budgets .
this delegation comprises 15 members of its ad hoc committee on direct elections and additional powers .
what council unanimity means in practice is that essential legislation is either shelved or lowered to the level of the common denominator .
it is here , in adhering to these values and not simply to a geographical space , that the true essence of our union lies .
i hope that you will honour your commitment to reach a first reading agreement with my roaming ii report .
in particular , this will mean regenerating the mediterranean forest , the economic returns from which are too low : structural fund - supported initiatives must encourage the regular sampling of biomass and its use for energy purposes , and the development of sustainable forestry and responsible ecotourism .
the value of information collected in this way is undeniable in terms of assessing the situation in the labour market in the european union , as well as for the functioning of the european central bank .
as for the method of electing this judge , the normal procedure provided for in the convention should also apply here .
president - in - office of the council . - ( hu ) mr president , honourable members , i will also attempt to provide specific answers to the main subjects .
in writing . - i agree that the eu maintains a leading role in international climate policy .
that is not the point today .
this is an historic moment : will the council , and particularly the united kingdom , the netherlands and denmark , allow themselves to see that europe is all about pooling resources to do better together ?
i am sure that the commissioner will agree that these are exactly the kind of figures that will help to stimulate the economy and create jobs , not only throughout the united kingdom , but also in india .
why do we keep secret the names of the 407 members who benefit from eur 27 000 each paid into a voluntary pension fund , amongst them myself ?
for years it has been trying to do as it was told , upholding the rules on state aid , competition and procurement : rules which are essential components of the project but are now being ignored all round .
however , we found ourselves with a situation whereby the banks were no longer lending to each other , as they no longer had any money to lend , and the entire system was collapsing .
europe must step up to the mark , and so must the european parliament .
commissioner , do you remember standing here just a few months ago , after the palestinian delegation had returned from meeting mr haniyeh in gaza , before the breakdown of the palestinian unity government , saying to this house that you wanted to do everything you could to support that government ?
switzerland will come even closer to the european union , and the eu will understand switzerland better ; as our colleague doris pack mentioned , we will be able to anticipate better results in referenda .
since the programme does not specify which policies it will follow in this connection , would the presidency inform the ep precisely which steps it intends to take in this area ?
as you know , three people tragically and needlessly lost their lives during peaceful demonstrations by greek citizens claiming a better tomorrow .
however , the euro does not sit in isolation .
we will continue , therefore , to work actively in geneva and bilaterally to get a deal .
accordingly , no council representative is present today but that is not indicative of disregard of the european parliament . the reasons for this absence are procedural ones .
i understand the attitude of our fellow members from central and eastern europe and the baltic states in particular , who have suffered a great deal from russian domination in the form of soviet control and a harsh and oppressive system , which has now happily faded away .
i think that we have all found that cooperation is better and the dialogue between the council and parliament is closer , and i think it is also important that commissioner cecilia malmström regularly informs the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs , the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs of the developments . i think this is the key to ensuring that good agreements do indeed continue to be reached in the future .
there is a certain amount of scepticism in washington and elsewhere about how serious the european union is about climate change .
after all , it is only a matter of protecting designs , not patents .
it is in this country that some very important battles are being fought in relation to drugs trafficking , the fight against authoritarianism and fundamentalism , and the establishment of the rule of law and democracy , which are , unfortunately , still very fragile .
this also applies to traditional means of control like the digital tachograph and the waybill , of which you are probably aware .
that is why we must impose strict , binding rules .
the regional dimension should therefore not be forgotten , but rather encouraged , whether through greater participation by regional and local entities , or through an increase in the role of urban and rural areas , as it is only through the stimulation of regional competitiveness that we will have solid competitiveness at global level .
in algeria the government has restricted religious freedom for non - muslims , and this has had a direct impact on christians living in that country .
it is now three years since this parliament said that the council , the great absentee , should be involved in order to account for how it spends the greater part of the budget which it controls .
there is a close link between security , political stability and the economy .
i voted for this motion for a resolution which supports the dignity , welfare and development of every person as values which ought to be the main objectives of economic development .
furthermore , i must energetically contradict those who have said that dairy products are too expensive .
that sounds great , mr harbour , but i still think that we have some work to do on our side , too .
mr president , commissioner , this week , us senators bernie sanders and sherrod brown have written to the us patent and trademark office to demand a thorough check to ensure that the wording of the negotiated acta agreement can be reconciled with existing us legislation .
at a time when the communist authorities in chişinău are continuing to hold on to power through deceit and torture , the prime minister of the country occupying the eu presidency is content to describe the crisis at the eu 's borders as ' worrying ' .
( the oral amendment was accepted . )
therefore , i suggest that the commission consider not only those people at risk of losing their jobs , but also those who are finding it difficult to enter or return to the labour market .
that is not exactly the same in the case of oil , other energies or raw materials of all kinds .
mr sterckx has just spoken again of strategic partnership , and rightly so .
i would ask that my fellow members kindly indicate with a show of hands who among you is willing to take this case seriously and take part in a detailed investigation .
mr president , i wish to thank everyone who participated in this debate today .
we should give all the help we can with regard to public investment , particularly in these countries .
mr borloo will speak after the political groups , and mr borloo will speak again at the end of the debate .
we will also adjust the regulations for the funds accordingly , and lay the basis for a new cohesion formula : territorial cohesion , the framework for the period after 2013 .
the day after , let us not kid ourselves , it will be in milan and , shortly after that , it will be in brussels or paris .
firstly , the minimum age for supporting a legislative initiative has been fixed at 18 years old which is the minimum age for voting in european parliament elections and as is required to participate in instruments of direct democracy , such as referendums .
thank you for listening .
i hope that you will still be able to send out clear signals along these lines throughout the remainder of the swedish presidency .
in order to avoid negative consequences , europe must be able to meet this challenge by setting out and implementing a policy of prevention that acts on the causes of economic and political instability in these countries , proposing shared solutions that can prevent or at least reduce the magnitude of the phenomenon .
my fellow members rightly raised this matter and we need to find answers and to update the directive which we have applied to date .
my thoughts are also with the victims .
some parties , for example , the german federal ministry of economics and technology , claim that these are - and i quote - ' non - critical items ' .
furthermore , i agree that we should call on the council to confirm its intention to officially adopt this law at the forthcoming european council , in order to ensure a fair , adequate level of visibility for such an important initiative .
the debate is closed .
there are thousands of faceless civilians who still live and die in land contaminated by radiation : in iraq , in afghanistan , in kosovo , in bosnia , in somalia , unaware of their fate .
in parallel , we are working with other members of the world trade organisation to obtain the necessary permission - a wto waiver - which has to be granted before the measure takes effect .
secondly , these olympic games are going to take place .
we have no choice .
only this way will we be able to create a europe which the new generations will see as an opportunity and not as a millstone .
better coordination within the commission is also urgently needed .
it has to do with the need to have some kind of division of labour in such an important area .
i believe that it does and that the sooner it takes action on this matter , the better !
nevertheless , the furtive and back - handed introduction of divisive issues under cover of these very topics is turning into a regrettable habit .
we do not need to invent sophisticated indicators to observe that in the european union there are governments where there is no woman or others that uncritically defend traditions and practices violating woman 's rights .
agriculture and rural development are a further priority area for europe .
the rapporteur writes , ' for the consumer affordability is a key issue .
by some fate of the calendar we are discussing this directive today , while we are voting on it tomorrow , which is world autism awareness day .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am sorry for what happened earlier but i certainly had no intention of intimidating my fellow member , and i offer my apologies to her .
- ( nl ) madam president , i would also like to begin by thanking all of the rapporteurs for their extremely interesting reports .
in fact , the internet , for the first time in the world , has come to represent the exercise of a right and a fundamental freedom .
in writing . - this is a non - legislative report which has undergone substantial revision in committee as a direct result of our input .
this provision refers explicitly and exclusively to complaints before the court .
at the moment , the procedure works like this : you propose accession to the euro area , we are consulted , along with the council comprising the heads of state or government , and then the economic and financial affairs council has to make a decision .
president - in - office of the council . - mr medina ortega , the problems you were mentioning will not be resolved in a short period of time .
it is therefore entirely appropriate that two projects appeared on the european agenda at almost the same time , one concerning a mediterranean union and the other an eastern partnership .
you know that i personally am not the kind of commissioner who has a problem in regulating .
i would like to say in advance that sovereignty over water resources must remain a national matter .
it is quite a step forward , quite a step in the right direction to have this type of operation .
on that policy , the presidency will stand up and fight .
the eu solidarity fund was created in order to demonstrate the european union 's solidarity with the populations of regions devastated by disasters .
the report also takes account of scientific research in this area of veterinary science .
we have contributed throughout the committee and trialogue process to ensure that the parliament 's preferred outcome is realistic , workable , and lasting .
i fully support the rapporteur , mrs swinburne , and her idea to promote competition between trading venues for execution services .
i am opposed to security policies which will help to militarise africa .
first of all , i wanted to say to the minister that i think we have already proved that the community method works well .
madam president , deliberate avoidance of economic governance and of banking regulation at both national and european level has delivered us into this crisis , and the crisis is obvious to everybody in terms of jobs , lack of growth , pensions lost , etc.
we want the title of subheading 1a , ' competitiveness for growth and employment ' , not just to be purely rhetorical , but also to include specific measures .
it is , therefore , natural that the protection of the watercourse and its broad surrounding area from pollution should be one of the key pillars of the privileged cooperation between the participating countries .
however , we need to understand that the very things that we all used to think belonged to the realm of fantasy and the film world - i read about them in story books when i was a child - are now knocking at our door , are a visible danger , a reality .
that means that the standards that commissioner barrot described here today , namely security standards for police cooperation , in the fight against illegal immigration and economic migration and for biometric data , are the agreed minimum standards which represent the rules of play .
i see our union as enriching the countries when we enter , and i have yet to see an enlargement that has made our union weaker .
the project 's cross - border nature means that the espoo convention must be adhered to , while the member states involved must properly enforce the provisions of the directive on environmental impact assessments before granting an implementation permit .
now , the approval of the budget authority is required .
therefore , it should also be said loud and clear that there is something worse than no agreement and that is a poor agreement .
( pl ) madam president , i have long since become used to the flagrant hypocrisy that prevails in this house .
the second issue concerns safety , and the health and safety of workers in particular .
under these circumstances the pressure to improve the human rights situation in china is dwindling .
as we speak , 26 crew members of the fishing vessel playa de bakio have been seized off somalia and perhaps , as my fellow member said earlier in this house , we should not only show solidarity with their families , but also request the european union to take action in this matter and to make every effort to free these fishermen .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , we cannot allow certain governments to build new ones .
i want to assure you that we take the consultation very seriously .
therefore , what we have here is simply a lack of proper coordination of european funds .
only recently the arctic region was the subject of the arctic countries ' national security and research investigations .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , anti - dumping represents one of the most incisive instruments for defending commercial decency in the european union in order to compete fairly on the market .
however , the commission has presented here today a series of proposals and initiatives , some of which have already been implemented and others which will be implemented and which naturally will merit the council 's full attention and effort .
this situation is particularly problematic when we know that such programmes can limit the government 's capacity to invest in development and when overly ambitious goals are set , particularly as regards inflation and the budget deficit .
the resolution fails to take any account of the political context or of the fact that the israeli authorities need to be able to guarantee the security of their citizens .
this , however , does not depend only on the institutions introduced or modified by the treaty ; it depends primarily on the political will of the leaders of the member states .
this report deserves my vote in favour as it is absolutely desirable that it be adopted now , at first reading .
since the second world war , the fundamental principle in international relations was that aggression must not pay , or that political concessions should not be made to aggressors , but moscow has been victorious and nato humiliated , with the eu playing both sides .
then there is the question of whether we can manage to do that during this legislative term or whether we should start with recommendations and then move on to legislation .
my second comment concerns the global battle for standards , especially environmental and social standards , and more specifically environmental standards .
member of the commission . - madam president , yes , i have seen the film minority report .
there is , however , another important issue : the budget also needs to be highly flexible and to be able to respond quickly to citizens ' needs , to people 's needs and to changing needs .
the agreement was signed on 4 november in stockholm and ratified by the croatian parliament on 20 november .
this sets out a shared vision on the part of africa and europe on future cooperation with a view to promoting development in africa and combating poverty .
we should also maintain a balance across the osce 's three dimensions - the political - military dimension , the economic and environmental dimension and the human dimension .
in particular , i am pleased that the european parliament accepted the general approach of the proposal , which is to ensure the animal welfare legislation applicable to slaughterhouses is in line with the hygiene package which was adopted back in 2004 .
the second reason is the new situation since the people of gaza have opened up the border .
what can we do , through better coordination , to ensure that corruption does not take hold over these systems ?
the only improvements sought by the various parties involved were for greater transparency , greater speed and better access for smes .
opinion polls in ireland , and indeed the government 's own research into the ' no ' vote , have outlined people 's concerns over workers ' rights , public services , militarisation and democracy , and these concerns are shared by millions of workers and families across the union .
after the debate with the commission , the committee on legal affairs took a decision not to recommend the defence of mr tomczak 's parliamentary immunity on the above grounds .
so it has been difficult .
without active civil societies and the rule of law there can be no stability in the long term .
consumer protection , in particular protection of children , who are the most vulnerable group , is a priority for the european parliament .
now the military government has promised elections in 2010 as a step towards its gradual exit from power .
therefore , i would ask , please , that we show ourselves capable of acting .
written declarations ( rule 116 ) : see minutes
now we pass the baton to the member states and i hope they will commit themselves to it to the full .
so this is the way to go and this is what we are trying to do .
we are supposedly talking about liberalisation , but in fact what we are dealing with is a monopoly .
the scope of the revised ecolabel regulation has also been extended .
on behalf of the ppe group . - ( pl ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing four reports in today 's debate , and so i would like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work , and the european commission for its cooperation .
in the autumn of 2007 , three accidents occurred , each involving dash8 q 400 aircraft in aalborg , vilnius and copenhagen respectively .
on a personal note , i would like to say two things .
but we must bear in mind that not all problems can necessarily be solved through trade policy .
nevertheless , inequalities still prevail and there are many battles yet to be fought , not least of which is a persistent wage gap and the place of women on the boards of large companies .
it is a testament also to the work of all our rapporteurs and meps who , over the years , have pushed for such legislation .
and when we look at domestic support , which is the most difficult issue for the americans , it is obvious that they have now signalled that they will be able to operate within the gap or within the two figures mentioned in the falconer paper .
fourthly : mobility of staff is important in order to be able to make full use of educated people .
all i can say is that the council will look closely at all elements of parliament 's report with a view to making progress on these important measures in the shortest possible time frame .
the first partial toll of the huge fires that swept through large areas of the peloponnese was 63 dead , over 40 000 head of cattle burnt to death , 250 000 olive trees burnt and hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest gone up in smoke .
however , diversity is a central feature of the european union , and sometimes it requires political and institutional compromises .
although i voted in favour of this proposal to provide assistance to the workers of unilever in the czech republic , i believe that this is an analgesic and palliative measure for the consequences of the capitalist model , and that it does not represent any real progress in the fight against the root causes of the crisis .
as wine merchants put pressure on producers to lower their prices , they in turn cannot afford to pay the growers adequate prices for their grapes .
any other solution may result in a situation where countries abandon reforms for fear of the financial burden .
finally , we come to the lotteries .
the final findings of that study , which will soon be made available to the commission , will provide the basis for a systematic monitoring of the existing acquis in this area , in accordance with article 226 of the ec treaty .
this is blatant populism !
the statistical reports should be taken into consideration both by eurostat and in particular by the national institutions and companies .
at the moment , too many young people are failing to utilise fully their potential in education and vocational training .
at the same time , the commission must take into account , when a decision is being made on implementing projects pertaining to the internet of things , which network is going to be selected for connecting these objects .
this is something you need to look into , commissioner .
for a long time , gender inequality in the labour market has been a very important subject for the eu , and for years , it has tried to find a solution .
the commission has recognised the need for a transitional period for operators to achieve the efficient cost level .
( pl ) mr president , respect for human rights is a fundamental task of the european community .
i believe this is an area where , if member states work together , europe can ensure secure , cheaper and more efficient energy for its citizens .
the report clearly refers to the need to apply principles of subsidiarity and proportionality when implementing and managing flexicurity .
the question of expanding the framework of this directive should form the topic of further negotiations in the council .
( es ) mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , i also wish to make some remarks on the bluefin tuna issue , and more specifically on the closure of fishing grounds decreed by the commission recently since the quota allocated to the european union had been exceeded .
that was why we all delegated to europe the national independence that we had prior to joining this project .
we also need to provide effective support , including financial support , for institutions which are important to setting up and developing civil society , such as independent non - governmental organisations , political parties and an independent press .
all the conditions that the commissioner has told us would apply , in exactly the same way , to all the products i have just mentioned .
that is a scenario which it is still perfectly possible to avert .
but it is better than our sticking with the failed boycotting policy of the past decade .
in addition , belgium had to deal with domestic problems during its presidency .
we have not paid sufficient attention in our documentation to children who have left children 's homes at about 18 or 19 years of age : legally they are adults , although in social terms they are not ; this is an area which we should begin to focus some attention .
in practice this proposal gives state - aided railway companies the possibility of competing on a market where there is free competition , which in the long term poses the risk of deactivating market mechanisms .
egypt , which has a particular responsibility due to its location on the border with gaza , must take an active part in this negotiation process .
we should be involved in the nominations of ambassadors and eusrs .
a thriving market with job security are not achievable within the context of the cfp , and control of fisheries management must be returned to the nations dependent on fisheries .
given the current global economic situation , the leaders will naturally also discuss possible ways out of the crisis , of boosting growth and creating jobs , and the question of the regulation of financial markets will be particularly important .
we will see how many millionaires he gets to contribute to his campaign this time ; but i hope that this time there will be greater awareness , having seen their performance in the european parliament over these last five years , of what it actually means when you elect somebody from ukip to this place .
however , although we should welcome the fact that we can now break through the wall of indifference under international law , we must also ensure that all due precautions are taken to guarantee that military force remains a last resort .
how this will be done is not clear either .
yes , there are problems and yes , as minister jouyet said , we must leave a margin so that we can respond to the crisis .
february 's annual report by the european parliament on equality between men and women for 2009 says that , as a result of the economic crisis and the budget cuts in the eu countries , there have been job losses , particularly amongst women .
we should also pay close attention to the thoughts of cándido méndez , one of the principle figures in the spanish agreement , who attended the meeting of the economic and social council on tuesday , 8 february in brussels .
( nl ) madam president , it is very important for the european union to have an efficient and well - developed anti - fraud office , all the more so given how much budgets are increasing and foreign aid growing , without it always being possible to monitor effectively whether the deployed means are spent wisely .
relations between germany and spain are strained to say the least , and yet , three weeks into this crisis , we still have no idea of where the source of this contamination has come from .
that treaty does not introduce a specific legal basis , but gives the value of a european policy to the strategy we are discussing here today and which hitherto was based on a common political resolve .
in its communication the commission considers circular migration to be a useful means to be developed at community level to ensure more effective management of migration flows .
i hope that we will learn from the experience of last year 's meeting in copenhagen and this year aim for achievable objectives instead of setting our sights on the impossible .
- ( fr ) madam president , firstly i should like to pay tribute to the huge amount of work done by the rapporteurs .
( de ) mr president , this budget must sadden interested europeans and will , i hope , outrage them when it comes to the european elections next june , for it is another expression of the simple failure by a union that is , alas , in a state of paralysis to convey the message : yes , we have understood !
we must adopt the objective of a 30 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the eu by 2020 compared with 1990 levels ( paragraph 16 ) .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , by giving your support to this enhanced cooperation , as mr lehne is proposing , you will be taking a decisive step , if you like , towards making the lives of european businesses and inventors easier , thanks to what is at last unitary patent protection in europe .
we have very good nuclear safety regulators in the union , so an organisational shake - up is not necessary .
i can inform you that the commission is currently working on a road map for visa liberalisation for the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
we expect the commission to perform its study on food very specifically so that any possibility of misunderstandings between this label and organic products can be ruled out .
firstly , there is the earmarking of the revenue from road charges for investment in improved transport infrastructure , which is in the public economic interest and provides increased safety and better transport routes .
member of the commission . - yes , it is true that we have been aiming to make a proposal in the autumn of this year , but you have to understand that , in a project as ambitious as the ccctb , it is not possible to predict exactly when we will be ready to make the proposal , as the timing of the proposal depends on the finalisation of the impact assessments and its evolution by the commission .
we put this challenge to our fellow members .
it is also a matter of concern from the point of view of the free movement of labour within the european union that people residing in the member states of the eu will not want to move to another country or work abroad because it is impossible to arrange good , proper schooling and good quality teaching for their children there .
in the light of this development and the verifiable reality that these journeys are often undertaken in buses - criminal tourism - the question must be asked as to whether it would not make sense , in these circumstances , in addition to the drawing up of reports by europol , frontex and others , to re - introduce border controls in the relevant border regions and suspend schengen for a limited period where necessary .
can it be established , and , particularly , can we in parliament do anything to help establish those facts ?
that , sadly , creates loopholes , especially with regard to the protection of flora and fauna , where offenders are not sentenced as a matter of course and many are able to escape by pleading ignorance .
who will say ' we want to maintain peace throughout the world and ensure that conflicts do not turn into wars ' ?
we hope that , when it comes to the final vote , the spirit of compromise among the main political groups will enable the consensus reached on its main messages to be maintained so that there is broad final approval .
this approach must be implemented beginning with the research programme , which is a source of funding for new inventions , for the realisation of new ideas , and new jobs .
if we set the hurdles too high , we will be frustrating a major potential for europe .
this is why a differentiated , country - specific approach is needed - it is not certain that what is good for jordan will be good for ukraine .
in writing . - the economic situation in europe and further afield is as grave as any of us can remember , and it is absolutely right that the european union and the member states do everything that they can to ensure that a recession does not turn into a slump and that where government action really can kick - start economic activity , it should be allowed to do so .
the european union , its member states and its institutions had already condemned moussa dadis camara 's coup d'état on 28 december 2008 .
( de ) mr mölzer , do you think it is in good taste for the eu currently to be negotiating with colonel gaddafi over the return of refugees when there have been 40 people injured in demonstrations in libya today ?
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , the people of zimbabwe have suffered horrendously .
the motorway that is under construction in transylvania could likewise cause serious environmental damage .
the amount proposed in the preliminary draft budget for the frontex agency has therefore been included .
on behalf of the commission , i welcome the resolution on early diagnosis and early care of hiv / aids and fully endorse and support the principle of breaking down barriers to hiv testing , treatment and care .
the women with whom we spoke said it goes far beyond attacks on individuals ; it is not individual violence but rather an attack on the community , aimed at destroying its fabric .
but it also stressed the need to act in five key areas : promoting demographic renewal in europe , by creating the conditions for our fellow citizens to fulfil their desire to have children , in particular , by helping to reconcile work and family and private life ; promoting employment in europe , by ensuring that more and better jobs are created and people can work longer , in order to improve the balance between active and inactive people ; promoting a more productive and more dynamic europe , by optimising skills at all ages ; taking in and integrating migrants into europe , by attracting skilled and unskilled workers from abroad and facilitating their integration in order to alleviate labour shortages ; ensuring the sustainability of public finances , by consolidating budgets and reforming social protection systems in order to guarantee adequate social protection and public services in the future .
how would the union be able to deal with such a request quickly , if this could be done ?
we thought , before all or some of the heads of delegation , that it would probably be best , for parliament 's image , to get the text withdrawn and to vote next time ; the crisis , may i point out , will not be over by the month of june .
- before the vote :
equally , it is important to have tax incentives for energy saving : there i share his point of view .
subject : long - standing minorities
the other point you made , which is something that concerns the council - and i here i will name no names - touches on a difficult subject , namely how to prevent offshore havens , whether overseas or on or near our continent .
those who are not convicted should be treated as innocent .
over the past few weeks in slovenia , we had a totally inaccurate piece of news being spread by e-mail about codex alimentarius .
if this does not happen , then for transport - intensive areas like the port of rotterdam and schiphol airport , it will be impossible for us to meet the present and / or stricter norms for particulate matter .
over the last few days , it has become clear that the member states want to retain these powers .
congratulations to their services , but these were national actions , and my question to the commissioner is this : what about prevention at european level ?
the more the debate was focused on europe , the larger the majority was .
the situation of women living in rural areas is generally more difficult ; they tend much more often to undertake hidden , unpaid work with no insurance or protection , for example on family farms .
what this really means is that more of the decisions on the shape , content and future of europe should be taken by citizens , and not just by representatives of the government that happens to be in power .

with the abject capitulation of the new fine gael / labour government to the interests of the bondholders , it is clear that it is not the council or the commission that are doing the supporting , but it is the working class in ireland and in europe , which is being forced to support european banks and speculators through paying for their losses .
it did not even await the findings of our own observation team - which , incidentally , were published just three days later .

following the agreement on the supervision package , which we also owe to the commitment of parliament and the tenacity of the belgian presidency , the agreement on this directive on alternative investment fund managers needs to demonstrate this ability to learn the lessons of the crisis , to establish intelligent regulations and effective supervision where they need to be established , such that all financial actors are subject to these regulations and this supervision , which are both robust and effective .
for a week , there has been no change to laws , nor to the composition of the electoral commission .

the proposal for a regulation establishes a mechanism , on the basis of which member states will be able to renegotiate , negotiate and conclude bilateral agreements with third countries in the area of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters .

there will be no reconciliation if the sides consider their own sins to be taboo and do not allow them to be mentioned .
that is why parliament , commission and council agreed to those targets .
we need to put in place a regulation banning this practice completely .
subject : political responsibility for abuses that occur during eu military operations
this is not an area for interference by the european union or the european parliament .

preventing deforestation is undoubtedly very important .
this picture is of the situation between 1995 and 2007 and , if it shows anything , it shows that if countries want , they can change .
there is no doubt that we are going to work together with mr barroso .
i also believe that the only option left open to the commission is to compare bulgarian law and its implementation with what the requirements are for all european citizens .
this , then , is not the moment for us to start to keep our mouths shut .
let us , as the eu , actively use our instruments for democracy and human rights , support the living civil society or even lawyers like shirin ebadi , for example , who is standing up for the bahai detainees there .

the report discusses recent changes resulting from the globalisation process .
there have , of course , been omissions ; i am not going to list them here , they are well known .
thus i believe that this prior authorisation should be the rule rather than the exception .
we have known this for a long time , and indeed that is the political course we have been steering for some time too .
on the cost side , however , there is undoubtedly a cynical abuse of our good will in order to lend credibility to undemocratic rule .
we will try to achieve the maximum possible with the limited resources available and i welcome vey much the strong support of the european parliament for these efforts .
therefore that would mean that the process of adoption of this would be faster .
i would like to make three points in this respect and the first concerns the rules of origin .
madam president , i will try to reply directly to some questions and points which have been raised .
however , the problem with this draft directive is that it is based on the most usual kind of stalking , in which a person has been a victim of violence by another and therefore must be defended against a repeat of whatever physical or mental abuse took place .

the application of civilian and military expertise should not be restricted by the technical labelling of the nature of operations , but should instead be decided on the basis of appropriateness and cost - efficiency .

this is a harmonisation that ultimately does not harmonise or conform to the basic european principles and values .
we desperately need that message in the context of the limited resources which we are increasingly facing from day to day .
recent events have shown that this is not an easy enterprise , but they have also underlined the importance of our continuing to work to this end .
another consequence is that it will affect other directives we adopt in the co - decision procedure , for which the method of negotiation such as was implemented in this procedure could be a good example and could contribute significantly to improving work primarily with directives on the green card and on certain other rights of workers that come to the european union .

even the inhabitants of the country with the highest level of employment in the world , denmark , which has long had one of the highest levels of competitiveness and highest standard of living in the world , have discovered that if they were members of the euro zone they would have more favourable rates of exchange and they would be better able to tackle the current global problems .
agriculture must be at the heart of the european union 's development policies .
nevertheless , i think that we can be satisfied with the final form .
the capital requirements will be especially burdensome to pe and venture capital .
the new agency statutes proposed by the commission seem at first glance to be sufficiently effective with regard to both the organisational structure , for example the reduction in the number of members of the advisory committee , and the budget .
i would therefore ask you , mr president , to speak to the french authorities once again to ensure that the commitments they made at that time are fully respected and , in particular , that members of the european parliament are treated in the same way as members of the french parliament .
our strategy will be an action programme that the three institutions , together with the social partners , with the stakeholders , by which i mean women 's associations and the bodies working for equal opportunities in the member states , will put into practice during the four years of their respective mandates .
so what we should do is become stronger ourselves .
this is very necessary .
( sk ) armenian government representatives yesterday warned me that the report on the need for an eu strategy for the south caucasus , in the section dealing with the conflict in nagorno - karabakh , includes formulations which do not conform to the official eu position as set out in the provisions of the declaration adopted by the foreign ministers of all osce states , and the provisions of the declaration issued by osce ministers in athens on 2 december 2009 .
this must be a key element in any counter - terrorist strategy .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( de ) mr president , i should like to apologise at the outset that i have to leave after my speech because i have to be at a meeting with president pöttering .
such measures as increasing energy efficiency , using energy from renewable sources and improving the eu 's energy security feature among the swedish presidency 's priorities .
nevertheless , we strongly oppose the second part , in particular amendment 58 , which intends new labelling requirements to be introduced at union level .
anyone with even a modicum of economic education will be familiar with the economic principle that specialisation and trade are the very driving force behind economic growth .
the quality of candidates , however , must also take precedence over their sex .
on the commissions side , we have already indicated to the polish authorities our position in assessing the compensatory measures needed to comply with ec state aid rules .
we should develop the agricultural industry instead of tending to run it down , which has been the case in politics in recent years .
many thanks to you all and i hope we will all see each other again .
they are damaging !
mr president , there are threatening signs of the revival of racism , homophobia and anti - semitism in many countries of the eu .
in relation to this , we have to ask how to approach the new strategy .
therefore , i am calling on the commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation .
at the same time , i am pleased with the increased attention being given to energy efficiency in buildings , which has been included as a priority in the european economic recovery plan and mentioned in mr reul 's report as a solution for reducing the demand for fossil energy resources .
i should like to say that this is a report that is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
george orwell could not have imagined it ; we have long overtaken his vision of a surveillance society .
those are the reasons why we voted against .
this is a sign of concrete solidarity .
but we have had bad experiences of olaf , including a lack of independence , a lack of transparency , secret lobbying in connection with the appointment of the director general and the supervisory committee .
we also know that controlling energy consumption in europe and using energy from renewable sources constitute important parts of the package of measures needed to combat climate change .
such a programme must allow the exchange of best practices , create a joint strategy and reduce the costs of resettlement operations .
that , after all , is what really counts .
it will also provide an emphatic reminder of the need to develop important paths for the preparation of new strategies , jointly approved by the member states , to be submitted in the autumn of 2008 .
i believe that this is a major development .
president - in - office of the council . - i think on the cap reform we were among those who were trying to push the commission to come forward with the new budgetary reform proposals , the white paper .
i should like to ask my fellow members to place their trust in this directive .
a parliament that wants to be taken seriously must be open to these new conditions and changes .
the debate is closed .
the approach taken by the us authorities and the fact that the courts do not view the publication of names , e-mail addresses and banking details as a violation of privacy are certainly symptomatic of overseas data protection provisions , which are obviously still in their infancy .
i can support your amendments and those related to the alignment of the proposal with the new control regulation , in force since january 2010 .
i would like to speak of the fate of parliamentarians who today are imprisoned in burma , both the members of parliament who were arrested in the autumn of 2007 and those who disappeared or died in unknown circumstances , when they were arrested , as well as those who were assassinated and who died in unexplained circumstances .
so this is how the commission sees those issues .
i would also like to hear a commitment from you in relation to the legislative programme that the stockholm programme will implement in the area of justice , security and freedom .
in fact , catherine ashton admitted yesterday during the meeting we had as part of the committee on foreign affairs that the approach based on human rights dialogues needs to be reviewed .
it should produce an umbrella , it should produce some control , but it should also give individual choice so that individual citizens can begin to feel in control again in these times of uncertainty .
last but not least , i would like to congratulate the slovenian presidency on the excellent result that we have achieved .
i will go even further and say that the social costs of the loss of strength in this sector are of absolutely fundamental significance .
that is the answer that we must give if we truly wish to start rooting out the hatred and the violence .
we are fighting corruption .
i think that further dialogue is needed .
banks and funders will have to take risks on green technology start - ups .
we are not thinking in terms of the generations existing alongside each other , but in terms of them coming together .
( applause )
however , the priest made it clear that , although the situation has worsened in recent years , it is also because the influence of islamic extremism as expressed by the ideology of al-qaida has spread to nigeria , and in particular to 12 states in the north that have adopted sharia as the law of the land .
madam president , we agree with the views expressed on the subject of renewable energies and their integration into the european energy network .
i agree entirely with this , but i would like to add that it is also required by the fact that the crisis did not arise in the new member states and they are not responsible for the turbulence in the financial markets , and so giving them aid is fully justified .
this is a very difficult problem to solve , but i hope that we can find an effective solution .
however , that principle of give and take should also be applied , in terms of symmetry , to this parliament eventually adopting a position on this package .
( fr ) madam president , with this financial crisis , the european pact on immigration and asylum will fade into the background .
it is now up to european governments to look into the budgetary possibility for taking on such a change and accepting it .
the constitutional process is an ideal opportunity to draw up a new civilian constitution , with the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms at its heart .
i think the answer is yes .
in writing . - i supported this report which evaluates the management of h 1n1 influenza and calls for a joint procurement mechanism for vaccinations .
this matter is especially important for poland , which will hold the eu presidency in 2011 .
this has to be our approach to the developing world .
in writing . - i am supportive of extending the coastal limits from 12 to 20 miles as one of the key reforms of the cfp .
what i take from mrs gottardi 's report on public finances is that it has learned no lessons from the world crisis .
therefore , no country is exempt from violations being condemned by right - and i would even say out of moral obligation - and we do condemn and should condemn these violations when they take place within the european union or in one of its countries .
as regards the achievability of the goals , i still have doubts .
finally , when does the commission plan to transmit to parliament the revised regulation for the next phase of gsp ?
thank you for the good coordination !
we also need to ensure that we do not turn in on ourselves .
furthermore , the tenets of increasing competitiveness contained in the report are fundamental to the strategy .
we have to be idealistic in this life .
the two amendments do not preclude one another .
it is scandalous that children are left to live on their own at all .
opening of the sitting
at a time of crisis the airlines are saving themselves by asking for these limits , just as we have said here , to be extended into next year .
that is the core of our action plan .
the railways proved not to be a viable alternative .
it is not countries with competition that have an unregulated gambling market .
- report : mayer
mr president , this report is about active dialogue with citizens , and the best kind of active dialogue with european citizens is one based on listening to what they say in democratic votes .
regarding the tec and what its agenda might be , we are currently working with our us counterparts to fix the final agenda for the next tec meeting , bearing in mind the input from advisers .
the compromise package agreed in the committee on the internal market and consumer protection is far from perfect but marks a significant improvement and a base upon which we can build in negotiations with the other institutions .
i have no doubt that we will be able to count on your suggestions , on your proposals .
i voted in favour of this european parliament own - initiative report , which responds to the european commission 's analysis of penalties for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport .
i do not think that , just because we have many important commercial links , we have to stay silent on this issue - on the contrary .
we have goods and services worth eur 50 billion crossing the ocean annually .
in my opinion , we are letting some opportunities go to waste with the present mobilisation of the egf .
that is fine but then he should please be here on time to submit his view to parliament .
i think we can be confident that there are guarantees for the future that ad hoc political measures will be superfluous .
let me now come back to the issue of financial speculation .
president - in - office of the council . - mr president , let me introduce the debate on the progress reports on the three countries croatia , turkey and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .
in addition to the human rights dialogue , the eu also regularly raises issues of particular concern with the vietnamese government .
ten minutes in total is an unaccustomed luxury , and i am not sure i will be able to use it .
i would like also to mention the idea of a colleague , mr mayor oreja , which is to compose a list of victims with whom the eu external services should actively make contact .
as a member of the committee on budgets , i would like to point out the third problem that the eu needs to solve , namely improving the coordination of community and member states ' resources with a view to making them easily accessible for the victims of humanitarian disasters .
one particularly tragic aspect of this was that those people who were particularly hard hit by the iron curtain were the same people who had suffered most under national socialism .
the euro is a success , no - one doubts that .
first part
the european union , rather than lament the fact that italy has not asked for funding , should take note of what president barroso said , in other words that if a member state allows slums to develop on its territory , what can it expect the commission to do ?
at the same time , i should like to remark that the title of ' human rights defender ' does not give mr orlov the right to accuse the president of the republic of chechnya of murder .
its purpose is to improve social welfare .
these countries are backward too and are asking for help , insisting that they should receive assistance .
or at least win back the credibility you have lost since september 2009 !
indeed , the report 's provisions do not exclude other areas .
only one month has passed since hungarian extremists in fascist uniforms marched across the border into a peaceful slovak town to the horror of local people .
the sheep , lamb and goat sector has had a rough ride over the last ten years as a result of a series of crises , including epizootic - type diseases , but more especially because of the decoupling of aid , which has led to a marked decline in the sheep and lamb population as breeders quit the industry .
i am afraid it is not yet fit for purpose .
seven hundred and eighty cubic metres of fuel were pumped off the vessel in the month following the incident , none of which was spilt .
i have raised this issue on a number of occasions .
the proposal for a european ' blue card ' should be developed and discussed further , along with the idea of a circular immigration project for unskilled workers .
( hu ) mr president , i must first of all point out how regrettable it is that the eu 's earlier target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the eu 's energy mix to 12 % by 2010 will in all likelihood not be met .
in this respect , we must encourage cooperation between member states .
in writing . - ( de ) after ten years of beating about the bush , we still cannot agree on effective methods with which we can put a stop to vat fraud - which , after all , involves the evasion of taxes equivalent to between 2 and 2.5 % of europe 's economic output .
let me stress that acta will not change the eu acquis .
this is a record to be proud of and i would like to congratulate mr diamandouros .
it is regrettable that this resolution is being used as a pretext for safeguarding the so - called common energy policy and its objectives of liberalising the energy sector .
icts can , in actual fact , significantly reduce co 2 emissions .
if this report is adopted , i fear that there will be even fiercer criticism from the public .
the adoption of this new tool will make it easier for these people to access the capital required to set up or develop a business and make their dreams of entrepreneurship come true .
an increasing number of companies are relocating , taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries , particularly china and india , with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers ' rights .
the schengen information system will only ever be a useless gadget as long as the dangerous schengen agreements are in place .
i am saying that i share your ambition but i am not seeing the goals being put into practice .
turning to higher education , the commission recently launched , as you know , youth on the move - a europe 2020 flagship initiative which sets out to make education and training more relevant to young people 's needs .
well , in the uk we measure inflation and our inflation rate has supposedly gone up to 3.3 % , as announced earlier this morning .
we are in permanent contact with the secretary - general of the united nations to see how this can be done and i hope very much that in a few days i will be able to report to you that progress has been made .
likewise , nobody forced us to hesitate and falter when the so - called ' peripheral ' economies come under attack .
i feel that the eu must show greater solidarity and provide the member states with full assistance to enable them to join the club of euro area countries and become fully - fledged eu member states .
no one has sought to prejudge what the hungarian constitution will be or how it will be applied in practice and it will , of course , be subject to the checks and balances provided by the constitutional system , the constitutional balance of the hungarian constitution itself and the fact that hungary is subject to supranational bodies such as the council of europe and the european union , which know about fundamental rights .
on the contrary , it is part of the solution .
unfortunately , there is no peace to keep at the moment but , nevertheless , the international community , including the un and the european union , have a responsibility to try to help secure this region as soon as possible so that peace can be realised in the future .
these irregularities are accompanied by many irresponsible acts .
it is very important to establish a system for legal migration , taking account of the needs of europe 's labour market and the capacity of each member state to receive and integrate immigrants .
the erdf stimulates economic development and recovery in less prosperous parts of the eu .
however , the consultation with the commission over this directive has also uncovered other issues .
social package ( second part : cross - border healthcare ) ( debate )
( ro ) it is my firm belief that this draft directive marks significant progress in terms of speeding up access to medicines .
if we want the european union to be a strong and respected presence on the international stage and its actions , including as regards sanctions , to have the biggest possible impact , it is essential to demonstrate great solidarity and avoid using different units of measurements .
maybe that is an area where we could better invest the eur 55 million .
( el ) i understand that you are unable to present proposals to resolve the acute problems faced by the workers both in your country and in the other 26 member states of the european union .
in the past , all information , packets and bits of data were treated equally .
i should like to stress the important role that the european aviation safety agency will play as regards the monitoring not just of aviation but also of company practices .
each country produces its leaders and experts , its technicians , bankers , sportsmen and women and all the rest of the range of skills that are enhanced by training .
i have test - driven several of the environmentally friendly cars .
however , i will say this : there are levels at which i cannot be insulted and where i do not see it as an insult either , because in order to insult me , someone must have a certain degree of sincerity .
mr president , we must indeed not just listen to the irish result but reflect and digest it .
the hearing , organised jointly by the commission and the slovene presidency , marked the start of a process , and the commission is determined to pursue this process step by step .
thirdly , it is time to set up a regional navigation information centre for the black sea , which will contribute to the security of transport routes and , generally , navigation in the region .
ladies and gentlemen , i should like to welcome and give the floor to mr georgiou , who is a new member of the european parliament .
the arctic is not some sort of theme park or museum : it is a living , breathing community with its own modern economy and at the heart of that is what is taken from the seas .
for this reason , the report stresses that the eu needs to fully implement its commitments in this field .
the next item is a short presentation of the report by mrs kósáné kovács , on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , on the social situation of the roma and their improved access to the labour market in the eu .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
thank you to those who voted for me ; i will do everything not to disappoint your trust .
how can we rid ourselves of these double standards ?
stateless people are a separate issue and should be encouraged , using all means available , to apply for citizenship in their host country .
vice - president of the commission . - within the framework of the third european action programme on road safety up to 2010 , a number of actions were implemented to combat speeding , drug and drink driving as well as to improve road infrastructure .
it is about how we make sure that it is a thread that runs all the way through all our actions in terms of support for the work that we are doing across the world to promote the values of the european union .
the fourth and final point - which i believe is very important to consider - is that it should be a global agreement , and not just an agreement among certain regions , and this has to happen by means of a process rooted in democratic participation involving all countries .
we are preparing an e-mail for all members .
in fact , there is no scientific evidence to show that adding docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ) to milk substitutes improves visual development .
today we are discussing the ecolabel scheme .
europe must be united and strong in order to be a real presence at the tables of the world 's leadership .
16 .
( bg ) thank you , madam president .
on the basis of the responses to the green paper and many discussions with stakeholders , a number of actions have been identified and will be launched later this year .
climate change is a crucial part of the broader agenda on sustainable development .
the vote will be held at 12.00 .
competition is very tight , and it simply cannot be possible for an individual company - or even an individual member state - to put in place measures which distort competition without the european commission taking care to prevent the distortion in question .
i remain open to considering this at any future stage of the codecision process .
i feel that we in the eu , along with the other members of the g 20 , have made great progress on a number of central issues that are crucial if we are to provide a strategic response to the economic and financial crisis .
in 2006 half of all products sold in the eu that were deemed hazardous to health were manufactured in china .
it makes our labour markets less competitive and less flexible .
in writing . - at the heart of the financial crisis were banks taking excessive risks and failing to hold enough capital to cover those risks .
honourable member , what you said reflects my own thoughts precisely .
europe is the region with the greatest buying power .
to ensure that basic principles of data protection are respected and that pnr data is only used for specific law enforcement purposes , the eu has signed agreements with a number of countries on the transfer and the use of pnr data .
i , personally , am absolutely convinced that austerity measures are not the only way out of this crisis .
i do not agree with that .
on behalf of the uen group . - ( it ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the decision by the european union to support the recognition of the mediterranean diet as cultural heritage of humanity by unesco reminds us , above all , of the right to protection of the identities of peoples in their close relationship with their lands .
the information required therefore needs to be diffused and used .
none of them are panaceas and all of them must apply to all continents .
observing the fact that free trade agreements still generally contain few references to social standards , the report mentions a number of avenues , including the social clause and compliance with international labour organisation ( ilo ) conventions - whether or not they have been ratified already by all member states . - and enhancing cooperation between third countries and member states .
a famous american professor , larry diamond , has recently called attention to a worrying phenomenon he calls " democratic recession " .
i need not describe that here in detail .
rapporteur . - mr president , i know that i will not be popular for making a long speech at this time , but my two fellow - rapporteurs , with whom i have worked very closely as a team , have made short statements so i want to keep the team spirit together .
we have learnt to meet each other half way and to work together more closely .
fighting counterfeiting and piracy is an issue that should continue to be at the top of our political agenda .
i must say we were amazed by the number of applications received .
different aspects of production and products , such as the ones mentioned in the question , like cosmetics and medicines , are already subject to various community provisions , albeit not specific to nanotechnology .
therefore , this is a timely issue .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( cs ) ladies and gentlemen , an equitable and efficient system should guarantee access to education for everyone .
among the many actions proposed and the various objectives the commission has set itself in the attempt to bring about a real innovation union , one of the most innovative elements is represented by the so - called ' innovation partnerships ' .
i want to thank those who drafted the report for their versatile efforts , and for bringing what is an important issue to the heart of the debate .
the next item is question time ( b 6-0168/2008 ) .
to that extent , what we have just heard from the previous speaker was quite absurd , given that this topic is mentioned very frequently in the resolution .
it therefore requires progress on the last two proposals .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( de ) madam president , the first time i dealt personally with this issue was during nato 's war of aggression against yugoslavia , one of the wars which i opposed and which like many other wars was waged by western countries .
in 2009 , heavy rain led to severe flooding which caused serious damage to the agricultural sector , residential properties and businesses , to the road network and other infrastructure .
i would like to make this very clear : the changes that have now been made are not enough .
do you accept the challenge , mr reinfeldt ?
i welcome the berlato report on the possibility of extending the financing of the community tobacco fund until 2012 .
we do not yet know the implications of this decision , which is based on an emotional reaction to reconstituted meat and not on a scientific assessment of the actual enzyme .
small and medium - sized enterprises create the most jobs in europe but experience particular problems exporting .
implementing measures ( rule 88 )
we have made it clear in the resolution , once again , that we continue to challenge the repeated use of funds from the european social fund to finance the globalisation adjustment fund and i insist , commissioner , that you confirm today , once again , that this will not ultimately be at the expense of payments from the european social fund .
the next item is the commission 's statement on the situation in tibet .
a debate that is focused solely on the drudgery of imposing sanctions will not make europeans want to get involved again with their member states in the project .
the commission and i have to admit that the aquaculture sector deserves greater recognition of its assets and values .
on behalf of the alde group . - madam president , we have known for many months that greece is in a very difficult position .
these agreements , which are essentially trade agreements , create new platforms for parliamentary dialogue and are to be respected .
what we must ensure - and this is why we want to invoke our parliamentary powers of scrutiny - is that this collected data is truly unconnected with any private speculative ambitions but that is actually used , as you have said , for the sole purpose of harvest and yield forecasting .
i therefore have no problem agreeing when our group 's shadow rapporteur , mrs sommer , draws attention to a strategy for preventing the dangers associated with alcohol .
i should also like to emphasise that the commission engaged extremely constructively in the negotiations .
for example , the russian south stream pipeline supported by the state and by certain eu countries is in danger of ousting nabucco , which is twice as cheap and which , for its part , acts in accordance with the rules of the market .
according to the report by the european commission , it would only have been banned in spray paints , but yet again , upon a recommendation from the socialists , it has also been restricted in aerosol cleaning materials .
the alternative thresholds , however , must lead to the conclusion that an area in question is affected by a significant handicap , as desired by the council .
it has a new college of commissioners , a new organisational structure guiding the european union , and a new legal status : the european union is now a single entity , called ' the european union ' , with its own legal personality , and not a sum of different nations .
it is good that the european parliament is advocating the systematic inclusion of human rights issues in the agenda of the eu 's political dialogues and external policy .
in the new relationship between europe and africa , there can be no one leader as africans must be responsible for their own destiny .
the decision to create an innovation partnership linked to an action that will see the private sector - and , i hope , also parliament and the other institutions - participating in innovation and research with the aim of identifying robust recycling and substitution measures yielding real results is not just an announcement , but a specific measure on the part of the european commission .
it is important for the member states to fulfil their obligations to increase the amount of official development aid ( oda ) , but the european union should not legally penalise its member states because of a partial failure to fulfil obligations in the changed context of the financial crisis .
we must also mention the turkish authorities ' inexplicable insistence on keeping the theological school in halki shut .
if you act at european level with the same energy and the same determination , you will also bring this modernisation drive to europe .
the question also remains as to what has happened to the council 's response to the fava report , parliament 's comprehensive report on the cia and certain practices that have been used in the fight against terrorism .
in this case , however , it is a matter of an adjustment on account of storm damage in france and portugal caused by storm xynthia .
in any case , however , we must applaud the work of mr peterle in the hope that the eu will take more extensive measures in the fight against this disease .
moreover , tourism represents a strong growth engine for europe .
the cornerstone of the eu exit strategy from the capitalist crisis is to impose sweeping changes in social security systems , to increase the retirement age and to drastically cut wages , pensions and social benefits .
now that we are at the half - way mark regarding mdgs , it is critical that eu member states continue to progress to 0.7 % gni by 2015 .
in addition , public executions encourage aggressive behaviour amongst the population .
our package will complement the proposals presented last year on the energy internal market .
are there any proposals from the council with regard to putting together a team of facilitators to allow the different traditions in bosnia - herzegovina to come together to agree a common standard or common code for how the police force should work ?
it would appear that this year 's conciliation between parliament and the council will be even more challenging than was the case in 2010 .
we have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states .
in fact , we are subject to a demographic study only by an unjustified simplification and ignorance of what we are .
i support an overwhelming vote for this resolution and i urge you not to forget the despicable behaviour of those who knowingly caused the tragic loss from tobacco - related diseases of so many lives .
i should therefore like to encourage the commissioner not to leave matters at that , and to take the initiative once more , the right of initiative he has in the next few years to abolish this restriction of cabotage yet .
here in europe we still have a lot to address .
the eu is like a building under construction and therefore , the notion of halting its enlargement would run counter to the very principle it is based on .
it was not - because i noted your regret - that it was released just after the commission had released the documents .
full democracy does not appear overnight .
my question to the commission is : instead of fine words about one voice , are you prepared to lay claim to that role and , if need be , to push the council aside ?
on behalf of the s&d group . - mr president , in this day and age , no one should be dying from tb .
in addition , since eurofor includes a large contingent of french forces , it is essential to distinguish between the épervier plan and the european forces .
these evaluations are ongoing , so it is too early to assess the state of play of the preparations .
ultimately the question is how many more poor workers do we want there to be in the european union ?
firstly the immediate creation , in the relevant countries , of cereal stocks to be made available to farmers at a subsidised price .
we do not do justice to ourselves with emotive , hysterical or populist responses to the latest peer - reviewed scientific developments , and we do not do justice to our democratic mandate .
and i have not mentioned all of them .
these standards form an important basis for the discussions on free trade agreements .
member of the commission . - mr president , it is a sign of the importance that this house attaches to our strategic relationship with china that this debate has been scheduled during your inaugural session .
( ro ) madam president , global warming , drug trafficking , the non - proliferation of weapons and energy security are common challenges requiring global solutions .
this regulation will apply to all long - distance ( 250 km or more ) regular , national or cross - border services from spring 2013 onwards .
calling for one product to be banned will not solve the problem of irresponsible drinking .
in our report we are also much more cautious about reopening the discussion about national fit - in systems and other systems .
we also know that there are currently many specific agreements on data sharing between the us and the member states , and between the us and the eu .
mr president , mrs kratsa - tsagaropoulou asked me about liquidity .
i would like to conclude with a few comments on parliament 's recommendation on the development of eu criminal justice , which is the subject of the report by ms pagano .
we therefore need to give ourselves every chance to experiment with this technology and demonstrate how reliable it is .
in writing . - ( pt ) this is yet another part of this energy package .
amendment of regulation ( ec ) no 663/2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy (
however , while the process has not been perfect , we must not let this delay our work to close the gap between us and our economic partners .
in europe , our citizens fear for their safety , and with good reason .
nonetheless , we hope it will go ahead .
tens of thousands of members of the roma population were subjected to torture or murdered in the occupied eastern territories and thousands more died in the nazi regime 's concentration camps .
on the universal service part , i hope that the commissioner will find a way of ensuring that the telecom operators , which will now profit from new investment possibilities will , for their part , invest to make sure that all citizens have access to broadband in the future .
one small example is austria , where the income divide is about 28 % .
the pse is of the opinion that this is not the end of the story ; it is a new beginning .
finally , the council meeting on 11 february , the day after tomorrow , which was mentioned by mr lópez garrido , among others , is a very important meeting .
in 2008 , having seen all his attempts to get somewhere with the other authorities fail , mr klein , the manufacturer , turned to the committee on petitions .
dates of forthcoming sittings : see minutes
( el ) madam president , as you are well aware , while we are debating the results of the informal european council , the entire greek workforce , down to the last man , is on strike in protest against precisely these measures , against precisely these results .
we hope that you will protect the rights of dissidents and , in particular , that you will attach great importance to respect for these rules of procedure , which should not be systematically amended , since it is clear that they can benefit those who are , i believe , the true defenders of the freedoms of the european nations .
i have a number of legitimate questions about how the council can bring this into line with existing treaties , because in some cases , restrictions on the free movement of capital and payments are not permitted or wanted .
as you know my colleague commissioner connie hedegaard has already embarked on a programme of outreach .
in writing . - ( sv ) the june list has chosen to vote in favour of the report , as we are of the opinion that it will go some way to providing the opportunity to unite requirements for efforts at national level with regard to health policy with a free internal market .
this desire to artificially create such a market does not manage to conceal one of the main aims of the manoeuvre : forcing the states to harmonise their taxes and regulations so as to be prepared for all contingencies or imposing a 28th legal order , a supranational order , accompanied , for good measure , by the adoption of the euro by the countries that rejected it , thereby enabling them to participate fully in this hypothetical market .
in my opinion , even though frontex was not established for humanitarian reasons , it cannot be dissociated from this context ; it cannot be dissociated from the fact that we are facing a major humanitarian problem .
since i was a member of the european parliament for many years , i must say i am delighted with the enormous effort made by the whole of parliament , and particularly the rapporteurs , to move swiftly to adopt such an important piece of legislation .
( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioner , today we find ourselves discussing organ transplants , which is , without doubt , one of the most positive aspects of progress in the sphere of health , but which also opens up a series of problems concerning the rights of the donor and the patient , which must be dealt with on ethical , social , legal and economic levels .
fifthly , i am pleased that the director general of olaf is being reappointed .
lastly , we expect the commission , madam president , to provide a proactive framework to maintain the competitiveness and the very existence of the european automotive industry .
how will you organise that from here on in ?
all of europe was recently appalled by those parts of carla del ponte 's book where she spoke of albanian terrorists who used serbian citizens from kosovo for commercial transplantation .
this is , then , a clear signal .
the adoption of this report in plenary indicates a path which the european union seems to want to go down .
in writing . - in favour .
4 .
this all calls for tightening up of the definitions and principles of procedure related to ensuring security on the territory of the union .
the latter , far from advancing towards a just and sustainable peace , is worsening as we watch and is poisoning international relations , when it is not threatening the cohesion of our societies .
by means of strengthening these safeguards , we hope to enhance the confidence of european citizens in european institutions .
this is , in short , the responsibility that the member states , the european council , the commission and parliament too inherit from the portuguese presidency .
we cannot complete the european union with inertia or fine words or simply from common ground .
a major and important step towards complete equality is a new and modern piece of eu legislation on maternity leave .
let me underline one point : pacta sunt servanda !
however , the good news is that there has already been improvement .
i am referring , in particular , to the security problems affecting the areas in the immediate vicinity where the alliance can play a key role in the creation of democratic defence and security institutions in the balkans and extended region of the black sea .
well , there are a small number of points , but some of them are important in terms of content .
this is , in fact , what we are dealing with .
that is why i am going to avoid too much introverted institutional navel - gazing and think about action to improve the lot of our citizens .
the european parliament could then have participated fully , but as you are aware , that is not yet possible .
it is therefore necessary and expedient to review the framework agreement that governs relations between parliament and the commission .
europe , which , in the future , will receive ever more investment , particularly from emerging countries , must guard against such abuses .
first , information about the 21 member states and the concrete reasons why the reasoned opinion was sent is public information , so anybody who wants can get that information .
it is a few years too late and , because of this delay , the european commission is , of course , getting caught up by one political reality after another .
many thanks , commission president .
over the past weeks and months , i have listened with interest and indeed approval to the discussions regarding the danube strategy and the baltic strategy , but never a word did i hear about an atlantic strategy .
these differences should be rectified with the help of development programmes financed by the eu .
that brings us up against the question : what are we as a european parliament doing to calm the situation down ?
while the report is welcome , certain areas remain unclear ; for example , whether existing wilderness areas or potential future wilderness areas are being discussed .
interoperability has therefore become a fundamental concept for information and telecommunications networks .
the sector employs directly 12 million eu citizens and an additional 26 million jobs in other sectors are dependent on it .
do you have a date when these measures will be in place ?
yet the european parliament does not have a position on nuclear power .
this is a very important point to make in order to safeguard european taxpayers ' money .
mr president , i am pleased that in this report the european parliament is supporting the creation of the global energy efficiency and renewable energy fund .
i propose in that regard that , where some increase in payments is inevitable , it is offset by significantly lower appropriations .
given this , i believe it is absolutely vital for the eu to safeguard sufficient financial and technical resources for decommissioning units 1 to 4 of the kozloduy nuclear plant in bulgaria , as advocated by parliament in this resolution .
today in plenary , we adopted by a very large majority a resolution condemning failures in protection of human rights in the democratic republic of congo ( drc ) .
mr president , we are talking here about the safety of food for humans and the safety of feed for animals .
an end must be put to high risk speculation through a financial transactions tax .
however , we are using the time with a view to incorporating this into an amendment .
following the agreement with the african union and after opening a debate with the russian federation on the issue of raw materials , i shall travel to latin america at the beginning of june to discuss the raw materials issue with brazil , argentina and chile .
it takes two to tango .
this should be stated very clearly in this house today , particularly since we expect that the consultations and cooperation on events in north africa may prove to be a key aspect of good cooperation with turkey .
if there is a need to strengthen the system of fines , we will definitely follow this advice very carefully , because , basically , fines should be imposed in a way that prevents violation of the law , not just so that companies can shrug them off or pass the cost on to consumers .
ladies and gentlemen , in 2006 the european union devoted 39 % of its budget , eur 38.9 billion in all , to structural spending .
i am amazed to see that even from the conclusions of yesterday 's ecofin council this method is still not being used .
this is because the least that can be said is that in the ufm , there is currently a signal lack of clarity .
second , mr commissioner , while saying ' yes ' , we need more flexibility , and ' yes ' , we want to have more emphasis on the results and the inputs , how is that compatible with calling for a 10 - year financial perspective when we see the results of a mid - term review are entirely fruitless in this kind of exercise that we are going through ?
it is a european punishment mechanism , with the international monetary fund playing bad cop .
indeed , at the time you started drafting no - one could have guessed what the world would be like today , nor what challenges the countries and people of the entire arab region would be facing .
1 .
this is why i would like to offer my particularly enthusiastic support to mr piecyk 's report , in order to be able to discuss the issue of bus and coach transport and to vote in june .
also , now that we have a new treaty , we need to respect the competences of each institution .
i am not saying this out of a desire to repeat the reasons given by those of us who supported the creation of economic and monetary union 10 years ago , but due to the analysis of what has happened in that decade and of what we must do now , in these very difficult economic times .
in the context of this programme , several assessments have been conducted .
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to express my thanks once again for your cooperation and for your responsible attitude to this issue .
( de ) mr president , as we know , water is the most precious of all resources , and we must not let our water drain away by choosing not to adopt an ambitious water policy .
we see how the actual concept of discrimination goes beyond its definition .
this has an especially stifling effect on investments in the grid and the introduction of new capacity .
the banks themselves must clear up after crashes and crises ; it is not up to national banks and thus taxpayers to do this .
( ga ) mr president , i have a few words to say on the atlantic strategy .
in order to better define the position of third countries , on 22 march of this year the council adopted a decision authorising the commission to negotiate with non - eu countries with a view to signing agreements on their associated membership for participation in the european gnss ( global navigation satellite system ) supervisory authority ( gsa ) .
as a result , the next step must be the introduction of obligatory referendums for successful initiatives .
i would nevertheless like to point out that it is crucially important with this regulation , and others , that there is proper implementation and monitoring .
3 .
opinions are divided on this , from the opinion of the czech office of nuclear safety , which shows that scanning equipment emits radiation which is harmful to human health , to that of the french central civil aviation directorate , which considers the equipment completely safe .
to address this issue , since 1994 , there has been an interinstitutional agreement between parliament , the commission and the council on an accelerated working method for the adoption of codified acts .
this election will strengthen the democratic nature of our institution .
appropriate instruments exist at european union level .
that example should be followed and we need a framework directive to achieve that .
i would urge the member states to take their own agreements seriously , because when major goals are set , we need to have the determination to achieve these .
the energy charter is a key instrument in this context .
nevertheless , i would like to thank you for the last six months .
thank you , mr president .
a clear and efficient procedure whereby anyone may register a patent valid throughout the european union will ensure that new products can reach the market more quickly , thereby boosting the rate at which businesses develop .
with regard to rop 2000-2006 , the campania region has accounted for the eur 140 million funding package made available ; the money has been used to construct storage , treatment and recovery facilities , waste to energy facilities , and wet and dry separation facilities , to secure landfills , to construct , or extend , waste materials recovery facilities , and to implement separate - collection measures .
i believe that , although implementing economic policy programmes related to credit agreements means serious efforts for the member states , at the same time , this is also an opportunity to face up to long - standing structural problems and to find solutions and answers to these within a short period , which , in the medium term , could lead to sustainable and higher growth in these countries .
by virtue of its history and cultural identity , not to mention its importance in the global economy , the european union must act as an example and encourage aid for the haitians and the reconstruction of one of the poorest countries on earth .
information about this facility should be made widely known among parents and computer manufacturers should be urged to make such programs available as part of the mandatory content of new computers .
firstly , with regard to the roma forum : approval from our side .
those of us in the committee on agriculture and rural development who are in the chamber today are more accustomed to debating agricultural matters at midnight .
all of us , and the member states , too , have a lot of work to do in this area .
it is high time that we stopped wringing our hands and got serious .
extremist parties exploit people 's fears of the other and of foreigners , so that they can propose an easy answer to globalisation .
today i did not even have the opportunity to speak .
i believe that this is absolutely essential .
that is why we will not only be voting in favour of the report but we will also be giving our consent for both these countries to join the schengen area .
madam president , i would first of all like to welcome the fact that we finally have an opportunity to talk about the western sahara and to adopt a resolution .
so that will be very important work for us .
this part of the budget will finally come within the reach of parliament , and i am looking forward to that , i can tell you .
regard for this subject has also declined since the red card campaign and the world cup .
we have three or four days at least before the majority of flights resume .
madam president , i would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks to my fellow members in this house and in the delegation for the universal support i received in the negotiations , right until the end .
therefore , we should never forget that it took two dictators to launch world war two .
madam president , i share your hope .
finally , perhaps one of the positive consequences of china 's increasing presence in africa is this debate and the report that we are going to adopt tomorrow .
we will examine these proposals carefully but , judging by what we have seen so far , i can say that our group will agree as much as possible .
this violence is being presented by china as a mere interethnic conflict between hans and uighurs , when it is in fact the almost inevitable result of its repressive policy in the xinjiang region .
belarus ( debate )
the commission will also continue to promote sustainable development , decent work , labour standards and corporate social responsibility in other policy areas , such as trade and development policy .
by the way , mr martonyi has also held talks with the foreign minister of the benghazi transitional national council , as well as the egyptian interior minister precisely to gain an overview of the refugee situation .
the european union is proud of the fact that it has adopted strict terms for safeguarding public health and for protecting the environment and the welfare of animals .
i would like to comment briefly on three points .
the danube 's development potential cannot be fully harnessed while there are still unconnected international , interregional and local transport networks , while more profound cooperation in territorial planning and strategic development planning is still lacking , and while mental barriers persist .
this motion for a resolution expresses the need to provide aid to those european regions that were recently the scene of natural disasters , such as the autonomous region of madeira .
by this , we mean the design of a permanent mechanism that can provide defence in critical moments , whilst minimising moral hazard and making sure that such an instrument will only be used as a last resort in the common interest .
in response , the osce stated that the conduct of these elections overall was not sufficient to constitute meaningful progress in the democratic development of that country .
i would like to ask you to consider some comprehensive programmes and even tighter controls on member states regarding childcare facilities .
i will now very briefly give my opinion on this issue .
i should like to ask the commissioner what he intends to do about this , as it is high time we took action .
the international conference in bali will soon show how successful we are in this respect .
( applause )
i want to thank the hungarian president , mr sólyom , who visited the village right at the beginning and listened to both parties .
i believe that the time has truly come now to lay the foundations of a true european immigration and asylum policy .
but what we have not done here is to regulate hunting .
11 .
in order to safeguard equal treatment of all eu citizens , a provision has been included in the agreement stating that brazil may suspend or terminate it only in respect of all the eu member states .
in view of the strategic important of the project , i voted in favour of the report , although the issue of funding has not yet been fully resolved .
i think we all agree on the need for sound economic governance .
but in the face of the recurring violence , we have recycled those tired phrases so often that they have lost whatever impact they once had .
however , if nuclear power were to be chosen as a source of energy , people should first be informed about the costs , benefits and consequences of such a choice .
none .
mr pittella is right : a dab of powder , a touch of rouge , perhaps a little wool pulled over the eyes , but nothing more than an empty shell .
it is therefore essential for us in the eu to cut back bureaucracy across the board when drawing down from european funds .
it is no coincidence that the european commission is tabling contemporary solutions that are capable of changing european policy as a whole .
mr president , firstly i would just like to put the eit in a historical context .
it is also true that there has not been equality of opportunities during the campaign , and that the ruling party has had the overwhelming support of the entire state apparatus , while the opposition has suffered constant harassment and coercion .
i would also like to say something to you , commissioner : it is true that there are some member states that will and others that will not be able to give this aid , and that , according to you , this will create disparity .
lastly , i think that baroness ashton is right : this is a time to think big .
this assistance also ensures that these areas of instability do not jeopardise security and peace in europe , particularly owing to the refugees and displaced people produced by such conflicts .
on saturday , scotland became the first country in europe to implement a voluntary scheme of real - time closures of fishing grounds , with the aim of safeguarding cod stocks .
clearly , we could get bogged down talking about the economic excesses of 2008 , but there have been such excesses in more countries than just little iceland .
a coordinated european international investment policy could have an important impact on job creation not only in the eu , but also in developing countries .
we also need to revise our visa and border policies from a human rights perspective .
at the forthcoming european council , the leaders of the member states of the european union should think deeply about the advisability and the consequences of consciously by - passing the will of the citizens whom they represent .
an absolute red line for parliament is a 50 % limit for offsetting , which would ensure that the majority of our emissions reductions are domestic .
as far as the individual priorities are concerned , the most important task in the economic sphere was to deal with the effects of the global crisis and to continue implementing the european plan for economic recovery as one of the main instruments for restoring economic prosperity .
if we look at the matter in purely technical terms , disregarding any other factors , we discover that the highest category roads , in other words , motorways , expressways and category one roads , are best adapted to the operation of heavy goods vehicles .
this was underlined by the rapporteur , mr szájer .
( lt ) in an attempt to solve the baltic countries ' energy island problem , in particular with the growing threat to lithuania 's energy security following the closure of ignalina nuclear power plant at the end of this year , the european commission has drafted the european union strategy for the baltic sea region .
we hope that the 50 measures tabled here can contribute to further developing the internal market and taking full advantage of it , as it may prove a source of extra growth for the european economy .
inflation is now at around 3.6 % , even though 2 % was promised .
use of the opt - out will not be restricted , no monitoring will be introduced , and workers will have to continue working up to 78 hours a week .
human rights policy cannot be based on political exigencies , however , if it is to retain any credibility .
for that to happen , however , the european union has to pay more attention to safeguarding quality , traditional and certified products , so that they can be protected internationally to avoid fraud on foreign markets involving products that have been falsely attributed to our countries .
however , what is the point of providing support and money - other than to assuage our own bad conscience - if , at the same time , we make it more difficult , by means of duties and barriers to trade , for people to recover by their own efforts .
madam president , i would just like to make two brief comments .
there is massive infrastructure which needs to be put in place , whether it is a north sea supergrid or , on a smaller scale , plug - in charging points for electric cars .
why is it that the council always thinks in intergovernmental and national terms and not in european terms ?
we remember the victims of authoritarian systems , the victims in european countries , in nationalistic and militaristic regimes , in spain , in portugal and in greece .
on behalf of the alde group . - ( fi ) mr president , it is important to have an open discussion forum and cooperation between the united states of america and the european union .
the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) is the first to call upon them to do so .
in this sense , and in general , these agreements should be part of a broader framework that also aims to promote the rights of immigrant workers and protect them against the appalling phenomenon of exploitation .
un agencies , the red cross and other humanitarian organisations should have full access to these centres in line with international humanitarian law .
the next item is the vote .
let us look at the substance of the question and we will understand that the content of the decree is absolutely fair : it is a case of targeting those who threaten law and order with their conduct , comprising public safety and harming all those who come to italy to improve their lives by working .
you mention the importance of the internet for economic development and the social cohesion of europe , and even promise that the new commission will develop a ' european digital agenda ' .
the european private company exposes the political powers that voted for maastricht , which tried to deceive the workers when they voted for the bolkestein directive by lying and saying that it allegedly did not affect workers ' rights .
i thank you for this report .
- ( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first a very big thank you to the rapporteur , mr lehne , who has done a magnificent job and has found appropriate solutions to a very difficult question in agreement with the members from the other groups .
i would like mrs ferrero - waldner to make a clear declaration that until free elections are held in belarus , there will not be any political contacts with the country in areas for which she is responsible , except for the opposition , which will not be excluded in this way .
the candidates have had hearings before the committee on economic and monetary affairs , which has given its approval .
if such progress is made , the eu must consider extending a promise of membership to ukraine .
the road lobby 's arguments are fallacious : as the load capacities of current hgvs are already underused , the reduction in pollutant gas emissions that people are trying to lure us with on the basis of ' fewer vehicles for more transported goods ' is a trick .
regrettably , not all market players seem convinced already .
why ?
the world food programme needs usd 7 million more this year in order to help the same number of people as last year .
however , as so many opinions have been voiced , i should like to make just a couple of important points .
hungarians were among the greatest victims of this dictatorship .
one of the specific purposes is to promote the nabucco project .
we have already talked about gazprom , chinese activity in africa and venezuela 's use of the funds to export the bolivarian revolution , and we will be talking more today as a result of the financial crisis .
the 1995 decision is a decision between the member states , reflecting the fact that consular assistance and protection is an exclusive national responsibility and that consular relations are governed mainly by the vienna convention on consular relations .
whilst i am against more red tape , we must find a system whereby drivers and their companies can be more easily prosecuted when they cause accidents in other member states .
i think we all agree , in any case , that the best way forward is to have a transitional process , supported by the widest possible political consensus , until the elections are held .
the european benchmark , adopted by the council in may 2009 , aims at an adequate level of basic skills in reading , mathematics and science by calling for the share of low achievers aged 15 to be reduced to below 15 % by the year 2020 .
i therefore believe it is entirely appropriate to ask the president of the house whether a common europe is a europe of diktats or a europe of agreements .
the report rules out the unrestrained use of databases , as data may only be used for specific purposes , must be subject to judicial control in the member states , and may only be processed on a case - by - case basis .
let me also say , because this was mentioned , that the energy council will not overlap with the tec .
i endorse them on behalf of the ppe - de group : we all support the compromises .
( nl ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to start by paying tribute to all those who have been working hard on this package of late , but i also support the previous speakers from my group .
turkey will be democratised if we talk to it clearly and strictly .
it did not happen , and things will only be more difficult as a result in future .
a single heritage is a fiction , fed previously by cultural eurocentrism ( europe as a ' vanguard ' and other aspects mentioned ) and fed nowadays by the oft - repeated myth of a ' european ' cultural identity .
local projects involve a large amount of work , and this contributes to the creation of large numbers of new jobs .
the cfcs and halons that have the strongest ozone - depleting effect have been completely eliminated , save for a limited number of exceptions .
the text has not yet been voted on , the compromise has not been adopted , and yet these people are suffering great economic misery , because of us .
we must not forget either the key role played by both national governments and the european commission in drafting and effectively implementing european policies at national , regional and local level .
i would stress the need for women to be included in senior - level decision - making positions , regular consultations with civil society , and that capacity to work on gender issues within missions be enhanced .
the main amendments proposed by parliament and reintroduced in the report , which i voted for , relate to issues that i believe to be of the utmost importance for the european market .
theme - by - theme specificity , which is real and does not mean business as usual , must be defendable vis - à - vis the system or the european court .
if we are going to be serious about authorisation and correcting the authorisation process to make it more effective and safer , we must tackle this flagrant abuse of the process .
the main criterion , less than 10 % refused visas , is a criterion depending exclusively on american citizens and not on citizens requesting visas .
we also need micro - supervision and , in my opinion , the commission proposal represents the lowest common denominator , the minimum .
the downward trend in the sector is also partly due to the volume of imports from third countries .
as specifically concerns the situation regarding the care of dependants , the commission has already put the following actions on the table .
the szczeczin shipyard is the fifth largest in europe and is experiencing serious difficulties , as is the shipyard in gdynia .
the health strategy that we adopted today in the commission will be sent to parliament to be discussed with you as well .
we are , in fact , rhinelanders , but nevertheless , we are very interested in the danube , although it actually flows in a direction with which our life paths have relatively little to do .
this will show to what extent the core of the cohesion policy stands to meet the challenge of new circumstances .
more than two thirds of the austrian population - although they are not alone - are of the opinion that we can manage the crisis with the assistance of the european union only - and that means together .
because the companies were not supplying the goods and services that consumers wanted to buy , we are now throwing aside rules on state aid and keeping up companies that may not survive in the long term .
moving with the times and redrafting its regulations is a prerogative of the european system , particularly in view of the importance and continuous development of the tourism sector in europe over the last decade .
with operation atalanta , we have reinforced our capabilities in this remote maritime area .
i voted for this report and would like to thank the rapporteur for the job she has done and for the suggestions .
foreign policy is a serious matter : it needs strategies , firm objectives and clear alliances .
above all , therefore , we need the political determination to take action to save many human lives , to stop this silent slaughter of innocent children whose only crime is to have been born in a poor country .
without those commitments , we are heading for a climatic , political and moral disaster .
the terrorist attacks in the us showed that even third countries with sophisticated infrastructure can find it difficult to cope under extreme circumstances .
instead it is free movement which takes precedence over it .
the ranks of the poor are increasingly being swollen by people who do have jobs .
i am not persuaded by the financial arguments which emphasise the high costs of introducing the directive in relation to disabled people .
the negotiations with the council have led to solutions that can be accepted without reservation , especially in sensitive fields such as the protection of vulnerable people and unaccompanied minors , the conditioning of repatriation to the countries of origin or countries where the european union has concluded bilateral agreements in this field .
another subject that was addressed in this long discussion was easier access to standards .
it is therefore very pleasing that we have succeeded in improving our own environmental protection data , one example being a 12.9 % drop in co 2 emissions in 2008 .
of course , it can cite article 8 of the cotonou agreement to strengthen the dialogue with the political authorities of that country .
the same applies to minority ethnic groups .
i would like to mention three key factors .
it is only here and in ' sarkozia ' that it can be said that the treaty of lisbon is fundamentally different from the european constitution , when the vast majority of eu heads of state and government and the father of the constitution itself , valéry giscard d'estaing , state the exact opposite .
i am quite sure , however , that when these changes are transposed , some compromise solutions will need to be evaluated , and it will be essential to carry out any resulting adjustments so long as they are considered feasible in terms of the convention itself .
it has also improved water governance and management in acp countries .
more efficient energy use is the key to unlocking massive environmental and economic benefits - and reducing europe 's annual energy bill by around eur 200 billion .
this directive represents major progress .
i cannot fail to notice that the most recent surveys show croatians to be suspicious of their country 's future entry into the union and critical of the eu 's actions .
i find it appropriate to support the council 's position in favour of the interim partnership agreement , because i consider guaranteeing supplies of resources a priority , especially in view of their scarcity and environmental degradation .
next year europe will be united as it has never been before .
and yet europe is filled with millions of muslims who have come here from all sorts of backgrounds and causations ; just as europe would still be filled with jews , had it not been for the horrors of the second world war .
we cannot afford to wait until 2012 for this to come into force .
on energy efficiency and promotion of renewables , the commission fully shares the concerns of the committee on industry , research and energy , but we believe that the internal market directive is not the best place to discuss this subject .
in this sense , giving a financial dimension to the europe 2020 strategy brings into play and gives a central role to our consistency and credibility .
i think that this is worrying .
( fi ) mr president , iran would have an important role in the middle east peace negotiations but , to our regret , the country seems to be slipping ever further away from the democratic rule of law .
the commission 's document refers to the alleged need to develop further legal immigration policies to alleviate the perils of demographic ageing .
( de ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , without a doubt we christian democrats recognise the sovereignty of the people 's republic of china over its territory , including tibet .
however , across europe we still face a chronic skills crisis .
we have also been able to resolve disputes very quickly , such as the issues of how independent the eit should be , how long the pilot phases should last , what the eit 's relationship should be to the seventh research framework programme , cannibalisation and even what is referred to as the ' eit label ' , i.e. the issue of whether everything should be shown on this label when a project is launched under an eit flag .
i met him when he was governor - elect of the state of zulia .
in writing . - ( de ) i am voting in favour of claudio fava 's report on sanctions against employers of illegally staying third - party nationals .
however , it is with great pleasure that i will take up the points , because they are so important .
in 2008 , billions of euro were paid out in contravention of the rules .
the actors involved in development cooperation as well as the international press have to be guaranteed access to tibet .
these will be followed by extensive hearings concerning overall governance and internal control systems in january .
the report by nils lundgren on behalf of the committee on budgetary control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the european union general budget for the financial year 2006 , section iv - court of justice ( c 6-0365/2007 - ,
in order to guarantee this flexibility , parliament is proposing that the cesr , the committee of european securities regulators , should formulate recommendations for the organisation of such a regime .
all projects financed by the world bank must have this aim .
we would now like to see proposals in this direction from the commission .
( ro ) i would like , first of all , as other fellow members have also done , to emphasise that the eu - canada summit is an important opportunity for deepening our partnership with this important democracy .
it is not about changing roles in the management of health care .
obviously , the self - employed worker is also aware of what he is doing , he can even load a lorry and wait and rest for two , three , or four hours , and then get back behind the wheel in an excellent condition as regards safety .
it was a difficult agreement to reach , as our debates have clearly shown .
as i conclude i should like to say that wto reform is an expression of the will to work together in the interests of development and in order to combat poverty .
we want simplified rules , not only in words , but also in deeds .
practically , could that be considered , and could we have a comment back in the announcement at 12 o'clock , please ?
according to frontex , 90 % of illegal immigrants who come to europe enter via greece .
measures need to be taken to prevent future problems .
those are the lessons of history and that is why i believe that commission initiatives of this kind are interesting if , in the end , they lead us to formulate a common , anti - totalitarian position .
this is all the more unacceptable considering that this legislation imposes a high financial burden on the european public .
it all stays the same .
i am fully aware that certain topics are problematic in relations with libya .
let us discuss this too , rather than closing down railway lines .
we are delighted that , in its chapter on research and technological development , the lisbon treaty provides a legal basis for the european space policy .
so , we debated , we were not entirely in agreement about everything , everyone took a step towards rapprochement with others and we ended up by achieving a compromise text .
in addition , aid is being provided to the european humanities university , which is currently in exile in vilnius and will continue its activities there for as long as the university is unable to return to belarus .
my eastern european colleagues and i on the committee on agriculture and rural development warned on several occasions that we needed a much greater increase in quotas , or their total removal , because our countries , being new to the european union 's systems , were the first to feel the impact of the crisis .

another point : here and there in european debates i come across people saying , ' well look , it does not matter if we have a multi - speed europe . '

commissioner , this debate ought to have been held about another member state as well , namely , romania .
the negotiations on the tftp with our american friends will also give us important experiences that we can bring into the pnr discussions .
the meeting of the un security council , which will take place on 5 june in the presence of the icc prosecutor , luis moreno - ocampo , may be an important opportunity for the international community to present a united front and to send a strong signal in support of the court 's work .

its conclusions must , however , lead to immediate and planned action by the commission .
in this respect , i need to make it clear that the progress sought by parliament was achieved gradually in the course of negotiations and not , of course , only in the last trialogue during which some adjustments were made , but at the political level , it was decisive .
i should like to express my thanks to the president of the european parliament for his kind words and my deep appreciation for the invitation to be here today .
people are being accused at random of smuggling illegal emigrants and are being held by the police for hours on end like ordinary criminals .
rapporteur . - mr president , i would like to move an oral amendment in the form of an addition to paragraph 64a .
however , there are some questions which remain unresolved and these issues should be viewed in a new context following the prolonged closure of european airspace .
it is right that passengers need to be informed if they are booking a blacklisted plane somewhere , at a travel agency , for example , but it is often the case that passengers decide to take a domestic flight only when they are already in a particular place .
this reality should guide us when drafting and supporting anti - smoking legislation .
so i support the intent of the debate .
it is true that some restrictions have perhaps been excessive , especially where safety is concerned .
the cross - border military operation against kurds who live along the border with iraq , approved in a declaration issued by the turkish parliament , will not lead to a constructive solution to the terrorism problem in the country .
for the 10 % or so of consumers who apparently read the nutrition labelling , the calorific value and calorie content are the ideal solution .
in fact , i would argue that , in the difficult negotiations which i hope can make progress , the authority and firmness of the community institutions partly depend on the quality of democracy that we are able to achieve within the eu .
the capacities that europe needs in order to fulfil its responsibility of protecting civilian populations and preventing massacres and genocides may be threatened .
that is why we are asking in this report that the secretary - general of the european parliament negotiate with the european commission to simplify the petition .
furthermore , there is a need to increase supervisors ' responsibilities , capacity , powers and resources for monitoring , assessing and overseeing the adequacy of the internal models , for imposing prudential measures and conducting investigations and inspections .
the significant discrepancies with regard to the definition and admission criteria applied to highly qualified workers obviously restrict their mobility throughout the whole of the european union , affecting the efficient redistribution of legally residing human resources and preventing regional imbalances from being eliminated .
our efforts must be aimed at creating suitable conditions for giving birth to , bringing up , educating , providing materially for and fostering the social development of children .
as we know , the hallmark of iran 's legal system is a serious lack of justice and transparency .
my group is asking europe to wake up .
that is why i invite our friends in greece , our fellow member state , to try to solve this problem together with the government in skopje and to relax its approach north of its borders .
hence this report is of special importance .
for example , we have to learn the lesson that inappropriate regulation can sometimes cause a problem , as the community investment act in the united states did .
i hope it will focus our attention on this important matter and strengthen respect for every human being , but also that it will strengthen our responsibility for human rights standards in the european union as well as in those parts of the world where the death penalty is in use .
agenda for next sitting : see minutes
as a result , there are many different labelling techniques in operation within the eu for sheep products .
it does not address the problem of undeclared work from the point of view of workers ' interests .
they are specific to the union and often at odds with national interests .
in writing .
under this motion for a resolution , parliament has approved the appointment of mr montalvo to the post of executive director of the european supervisory authority ( european insurance and occupational pensions authority ) .
the efd was given the task .
this could involve agriculture , but anyway , it is going to enhance whatever we do .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the call for a financial transaction tax is nothing new ; opponents of globalisation have been calling for such a tax for some years .
in writing . - i support the recommendations outlined in jean - pierre audy 's report ' implementing trade policy through efficient import and export rules and procedures . '
i believe that this project has two inherent defects .
this does not help those people in china who are working on behalf of human rights , freedom and social harmony .
i currently have two reports in the name of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs : one codecision and one own - initiative .
over 50 000 patients are on waiting lists in europe , and 10 people , awaiting organs die every day .
( the president cut off the speaker )
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , i would like to congratulate the tunisian people for their bravery , courage and persistence in speaking up for opportunities and freedom , and i hope all can refrain from using violence and that there will be free and fair elections soon .
it could even be several years before these provisions were applicable .
legislation that is aimed at maintaining the functioning of society should be initiated and decided by the national elected parliaments , not by the european parliament .
conflicting interpretations persist and some of them imply a threat to the lives of unborn children .
( the sitting was closed at 21.20 )
ladies and gentlemen , the proposal is completely clear .
i would maintain that the new situation that has arisen should be handled in a conciliation procedure between parliament and the council .
the regime that offered so much promise has become as corrupt and inept as its predecessor , in the process destroying the hopes and future of millions of kenyans .
however , four eu countries - estonia , latvia , malta and cyprus - have not signed agreements of this type .
our report acknowledges that many labour markets remain segmented and that worker mobility is still low .
through the appropriate means we must ensure that media and advertising professionals respect human dignity and oppose direct or indirect discrimination or stereotypical depictions .
moreover , i got the impression that the different levels did not always work together that well .
however , and this is the second key message of this year 's annual report , payments from the budget continue to be materially affected by error , except in two areas .
rather than trying to talk one 's way out of a tight corner at this stage , it would be better to consider the implications of requests before tabling them , but in this case , mr president , we can support your compromise .
this evaluation has been confirmed by a report from the swedish chemical agency and is also in line with the revised impact assessment from the uk pesticides safety directorate .
accordingly it is necessary to encourage laws in member status to combat this social plague .
is it true that it was too soon for the report to reflect the improvements in the expenditure under the new , current , regulation 2007-2013 ?
our small and medium - sized enterprises are particularly vulnerable in situations where we fall prey to unfair competition and our customs system is not always ready to deal successfully with such risks .
the proposal concerning the establishment of tariff - free quotas and the provisions for managing the latter complies with article 299(2 ) of the treaty on european union , which provides for specific measures to assist the outermost regions .
( cs ) i am delighted that , despite the spectre of politics , agreement has been reached on the harmonisation of legislation protecting all europeans who are planning a holiday abroad and who wish to rent accommodation abroad without risk .
all of us in politics and in society must take that path .
i look forward to getting to the point where i can have a real conversation with you in much better german than i can do today .
i would also like to add that this is the result of an adequate compromise and , as mr dirk sterckx has also mentioned , a good and adequate one , although perhaps only a first step in the right direction .
thus , in order to support moldova 's economic recovery and provide a positive perspective for people working in the wine industry in the country ( one quarter of the workforce ) , there is a proposed increase in the duty free tariff quota for wine , from 100 000 hl to 150 000 hl for 2011 , from 120 000 hl to 180 000 hl for 2012 , and from 2013 onwards to 240 000 hl per year .
no more obstacles to lawyers or ngos , no more withholding the names and numbers of those detained .
parliament hopes that the commission can present initiatives soon because the commission 's power of initiative is part of the framework for cooperation with the other institutions .
i do not imagine that there are many members of this parliament , even if everyone were here this evening , who could claim to understand them .
in this case we could not even agree on this principle being laid down in a recital .
implementing the consumers ' rights directive is one aspect of the problem , with full integration and implementation of single digital market , the eu 's internal market and the services directive being another issue .
( fr ) mr schulz , you know very well that in my capacity as president of the commission , i cannot interfere in portuguese domestic policy .
emergency measures therefore need to be adopted that give an immediate and suitable response to the sector 's socio - economic needs , such as the creation of a guarantee fund , paid for at union level , that ensures the stability of fuel prices and the use of all financial possibilities and margins of the eu budget to finance extraordinary support measures for the sector .
mr füle , the question of the return of the refugees , if you will pardon my saying so , has been handled by croatia in a way which could serve as a model for other states .
our argument is not with the israeli people , many of whom join us in our condemnation of the israeli authorities .
let me give you an example .
however , we must also say ' yes ' to the research , innovation and education area , in other words to the greater europeanisation of education and research policy .
the pillaging of resources , as you said , commissioner , is another factor that is exacerbating this conflict .
vaccines for polio , german measles , hepatitis b , diphtheria , typhus , mumps , rubella and meningitis , along with combined therapy drugs for hiv , medicines to control asthma , life support systems for premature babies and deep brain stimulation for parkinson 's disease , have all been developed through experimentation on animals , and specifically primates .
both government and civil society have a role in creating an environment where people of various religions and beliefs can effortlessly interact .
i come from finnish lapland .
for some time , increasing numbers of people have been living below the poverty line , despite being in work .
in the first draft , which created the post of the president of the council , there was a proposal that this council president should be a prime minister who had been in office for at least two and a half years ( as a joke , mr reinfeldt , we called it the ' bruton clause ' , after john bruton , because john told us that he had been prime minister for two years and seven months , and therefore would be eligible for the post ) .
i have personally met the staff who are responsible for solvit in the czech republic .
these meetings review the epidemiological situation , discuss and decide on measures and on appropriate legislative acts .
i would therefore like to say that a change in attitude in all the european institutions , in all of us and in the national governments and parliaments , in politicians , is undoubtedly much more important than the treaty of lisbon itself .
our social market economy must be hardwired to seize the opportunities of the future .
the commission is pleased with the consensus on the common position taken by the council in the committee on employment and social affairs and i must repeat my congratulations to the rapporteur and the political groups for confirming their willingness to adopt a common position without further amendments .
on governance , i would like to underline two elements .
why ?
mr president , finally , i think it is an internal , italian matter .
this is being made possible through the development of eurocorps , permanent structured cooperation , and adapting the armed forces of member states to the eu 's aggressive plans .
mr president , in relation to the two budgetary votes , may i point out that a lot of people are asking : what contribution can the european budget make in terms of a fiscal stimulus in times of economic crisis ?
in addition , the prevention and fight against the consequences of natural disasters must be supported by concern for protecting the sea and adjacent zones against possible industrial accidents , such as the recent oil disaster in the gulf of mexico .
securing an observer status for the eu in the arctic council would be a good step in the right direction .
therefore , the european union should be fighting not for the right to wear the burkha but for the right to work without wearing it .
a great deal certainly remains to be done there with regard to the structural funds in particular .
( lt ) it is symbolic that 20 years after the fall of the wall that divided europe , today we are talking about europe 2020 .
finally , we wish to say that we feel that funds for these technologies ought to be part of the debate on future financing of eu policies , and therefore the member states should be required to make a greater effort , at least in the same proportion as they did in response to the energy crisis during the 1980s .
this form of alternative treatment for men who have committed serious assaults on women , however , should never replace the penalty imposed by criminal law .
they were accused by a french minister of having occupied the country .
these days it is important , as we highlight in this report , to emphasise that mobility between countries and between universities and business is a key to achieving greater cooperation between the two worlds , and we encourage not only the extension and expansion of individual mobility schemes such as erasmus for young entrepreneurs and erasmus for apprentices , but also the organisation of postgraduate european masters of excellence programmes , in cooperation with different universities and with the active participation of businesses .
in this sense we have a defeat this evening , orchestrated by mr reul , ms niebler and others of their like .
his death comes after 15 british soldiers were killed in the past month .
that is understandable , and i hope that the european council will deal with that .
we therefore voted accordingly .
anyone who has experienced the work of nurses , junior doctors and ambulance drivers at close quarters will understand that it is most unrealistic to assume that on - call time can be broken down into active and inactive parts .
is it determined to defend the common inheritance of humankind and to reaffirm that nature is priceless and is not for sale ?
in this connection i have a question , which the rapporteur also referred to , concerning the extent to which it is in the interests of the states involved in the programme for other member states to be covered by the funding of the seventh framework programme , when this funding remains unchanged .
there is a particular freedom associated with the internet - a freedom without physical or practical limits .
the question was : is the agricultural policy up to date ?
yes , of course , we need to find common ground .
we have to act against this not only for the benefit of the majority of society , but also for the benefit of the honest gipsy people .
the irish government 's duplicity was shown by the fact that it asked the management of aer lingus to postpone until today , after the referendum , the announcement of 700 savage job cuts in aer lingus .
let me now move to another issue .
as you also know , the european parliament and the council are currently examining this proposal for a directive .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , recitals a and d and paragraph 4 of this resolution clearly stress the value of prevention .
firstly , the time has come to move from technological roadmaps to the operational implementation of european industrial initiatives .
let the member states decide for themselves which risk products they will allow .
i do not wish to comment on that at this juncture . it is enough , at this stage , to monitor developments .
last year he was here in parliament .
there is no problem , however , because all european union member states are also members of the council of europe , an organisation which is well - equipped and well - experienced to address that issue .
different eu countries have different approaches and we want to keep that flexibility while fully respecting fundamental rights , freedoms and civil liberties .
i will not repeat what other speakers have already said , but i would like to highlight four particular points .
without these opinions , the council cannot make decisions ! ' ; spinelli , who organised tens of meetings on this issue in the various european countries , concluded ' the european parliament should have the courage to strike in support of its opinions . '
with its comprehensive and balanced approach , this report is , in my opinion , a good starting point for further work on improving the european energy system .
( inaudible interruption from the floor )
yet the strong signals were there !
subject to progress made towards democracy , human rights and the rule of law , we remain ready to deepen our relations with belarus .
( el ) madam president , the debate in the european parliament on human rights in the world is one of the high points in the political process .
with regard to the recovery of the european economy , the commission has taken the initiative of publishing a communiqué on 26 november , a european economic recovery plan for growth and jobs .
( ro ) mr president , the european union 's energy strategy must focus on energy efficiency , reducing the consumption of primary energy and energy poverty , as well as on promoting energy from renewable sources and the union 's energy security .
let me be very clear .
i have abstained , because it is not possible to guarantee that we have properly taken into account the legitimate interests of everyone involved .
silly young czechs !
europe is well placed to rise to the challenge .
- before the vote :
at the same time , it is imperative to ask misleading business directory companies to cease and desist their deliberately misleading business activities , because they are contrary to the spirit of the union 's competition policy .
( de ) mr president , commissioner , let me start by giving my very sincere thanks to our rapporteur , mr graefe zu baringdorf .
i asked about cathy ashton , the high representative , who was appointed last week .
this is the way forward for europe and it is fortunately also an important point of consensus between the commission , the council and the european parliament .
this makes europe a stronger partner at a global level .
firstly , there is the important role played by the european agricultural fund for rural development in modernising villages .
the armed conflict is accompanied by a humanitarian catastrophe : there is not enough food for refugees , there are sudden increases in the price of food , barely 20 % of children attend school , children are forced into the armed forces , and violence against children is becoming increasingly widespread , especially sexually - motivated attacks on girls .
- after the vote :
revision of the treaties - transitional measures concerning the composition of the european parliament (
for the sake of the future we must be sure that our children are given the opportunity to learn and to handle credit cards and loans properly everywhere in europe .
5 .
because of this , much information reaches its audience in distorted or selective form .
today everyone says that mr mubarak was a dictator .
this is not consistent with international standards of human rights in general , nor with women 's rights .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( fr ) mr president , president - in - office of the council , president of the commission , for this first presidency of a new member state , slovenia is inheriting a number of rather thankless tasks from its predecessors .
the key to improving the situation in this regard may be for the spouses of those who are self - employed , including rural women , to have a right to their own independent social and pension rights .
this was not the case six months ago .
it is vital that the eu acts as a facilitator and repository of best practice in this process , otherwise the whole point of the measures proposed would be undermined .
please recognise paragraph 9 of our resolution , which talks about the inclusion of the human rights clause in the pca agreement .
all of us as members , in these last days of this mandate , are spending our time tearing around , going from trialogue to trialogue and first - reading agreement to first - reading agreement , arguing about sets of words , the contents of sentences in legislation .
without them , we all lose out on their knowledge , experience and ideas .
what is in this text ?
in writing . - ( ro ) i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and emphasize the importance of the content of this report for the achievement of the economic growth objectives undertaken in the context of the lisbon strategy .
however , improving consumer rights should not be restricted to the internet .
future epa negotiations , as well as eventual implementation , should be the subject of closer parliamentary scrutiny .
this would guarantee that data protection is ensured and the material protected from seizure , but i am not getting any concession from the council on this point .
( pl ) mr president , unlike mr claeys i gladly voted in favour of this report on enlargement and the conclusion of negotiations with croatia .
president - in - office of the council . - mr president , i very much welcome this opportunity to appear before you well in advance of the next meeting of the european council , which i will not personally attend .
in that connection , i should also like to draw attention to the ban on entry into the united states by people with hiv .
( hu ) mr president , popular opinion in hungary has been following with great interest the developments in the water cannon case in hungary , and would like to have a clear view of the issue as soon as possible .
the debate is closed .
it also supports the development of innovative good practice through its funding programmes .
having said that , i feel that the past year 's work ought to make us reflect on the matter of the initial positions of the rapporteurs , and i must say we should be wary of adopting excessively inflexible positions on certain initial aspects .
there is no point saying anything now about the host of difficulties encountered to implement the international force , which was scheduled for deployment in november 2007 , finally commenced only at the end of january , and will not be completed until may this year as per the current schedule .
the relationship between the countries of the mediterranean is the key factor which gives cohesion and strength to an ambitious economic and social development programme .
questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers ( see annex ) .
collectively , these seven programmes represent approximately eur 1.8 billion .
our normal understanding of ownership is that if you sell me something and i buy it from you , it is then my responsibility .
i would like to highlight the paragraph in this report that calls upon the commission to produce detailed data on all types of infringement and to make all these data freely available to parliament to enable it to perform its role of scrutiny .
it has been called the alliance for european integration , but it is not just the name that matters , but the very brave action of this government .
mrs berès is absolutely right : what this is really about is finally creating a real internal market in the investment funds sector .
i am conscious that our interpreters have been here for a long time .
madam president , tomorrow 's vote on passenger name records would not have been necessary had we here in parliament been taken more seriously and kept better informed by the commission and the council on the subject of the forwarding of data by the eu and its member states to third countries since the swift decision .
many industrial companies would have to relocate to third countries with less climate protection , which will raise prices and slow down romania 's development project on infrastructure .
( ro ) the g 20 leaders established in pittsburgh in september 2009 that the main priority in the economic recovery plans must be to preserve existing jobs and create new ones .
in the case of older women or women who are physically or mentally weaker , the problem of self - defence and the protection of their own interests is even more complicated .
i am grateful to the commissioner for the information that she has provided us with , but we would like to obtain more detailed information on what point each member state has actually reached .
in return , we , in our countries , keep cracking down on short - stay visa holders , and a vicious circle emerges .
on this occasion , too , we worked together to find the best solutions when creating the budgets of european institutions .
do we get a balance of payments problem ?
food price rises occur when there is less food available .
( nl ) mr president , on behalf of the dutch party for freedom , i should like to thank the president of the court of auditors for the institution 's 2008 annual report .
the proposal therefore aims to promote innovation within the textile sector .
in writing . - ( it ) mr president , i voted in favour of mrs locatelli 's report on a european partnership for researchers .
an unemployed person in london is not the same as an unemployed person in paris , because different criteria apply .
it follows that we also cannot accept the so - called upgrade that the union has granted israel .
in order for the 2020 targets to be achieved , we must create an eu - wide effective incentive system , supporting businesses and individuals that use or introduce renewable energy resources .
( pl ) madam president , the fact that eu citizens have to migrate in order to find work , the fact that they have to be mobile because there is no work to be found where they live , and the poverty associated with being out of work , often mean that children are less well cared for , and sometimes even neglected .
with regard to the payments , only 9.62 % of the eur 347 billion for regional policy has been paid to the project leaders .
over the last two years croatia has made laudable progress in most of the areas covered by community law .
this is ongoing ; but in railways , things take time and investments are large and 85 % of the ten - t network money is used especially to improve the railways , including the ertms .
furthermore i believe the estimate of a eur 100 million transfer for youth projects is important , since parliament identified this policy as one of its priorities for 2011 , and these funds will be helpful in financing mobility , education , and employment projects for all the young people of europe .
this is because women have poorly paid jobs or work on a part - time basis .
the study shows that this is technically possible .
instead , we are condemning the peoples of southern europe to years of poverty and deflation and loading the taxpayers of northern europe with an enormous debt , all in order to save a few faces .
most eu citizens either participate or spectate at a number of sporting events and it is often seen as more important than life itself at times .
unfortunately , the crisis in this sector is now having a negative effect leading to a significant loss in revenue for producers , to which we cannot be indifferent .
i therefore call on the eu to concentrate its efforts on small farmers , who are the largest but , above all , the most vulnerable group .
however , the debate that is important to parliament is the debate regarding the political consequences of the crisis , because the european union 's motto is - i stress once again - ' united in diversity ' , and under no circumstances is it ' split by adversity ' .
i cannot see him stopping the traffic in beijing or washington ; i doubt anybody in brussels would even recognise who he is .
thanks to a compromise , the opposition candidate is now prime minister and domestic peace seems to be restored .
rural services will be decimated in places like staverton , hellidon , brington and harlestone , and milton malsor in my constituency .
the commission , moreover , believes that the office 's external mandate should not be limited to resettlement activities and regional protection programmes .
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr deprez , for taking on this important subject influencing the lives of citizens living both inside and outside the eu , especially because this document achieves a balance between the legal jurisdiction of community institutions and that of national states .
( applause )
thank you very much , and many happy returns to the commissioner on his name day , as we say in greece .
this route continues to be ignored , and in my view , its inclusion on the list of european road and rail routes would speed up and shorten transport routes along this line , and would also give a boost to the whole central european corridor and to all the cities and regions that lie around this line .
people are dying in droves , the death penalty is widely applied and those whose existence is viewed as awkward by certain groups are being secretly murdered .
this resolution of the european parliament is about the draft regulation tabled by the commission on the authorisation and refusal of certain health claims made on foods , relating to reduction of the risk of illness or the health and development of children .
community solidarity between the eurozone and the states outside it and solidarity within the eurozone . will you vote in favour ?
i was moved , and i was full of admiration for the brave and heartening behaviour of the cellist and his audience .
in the meantime , my group calls for maximum restraint by the security forces and for the arrest and trial of the ancien regime 's presidential guard leadership responsible for the shooting , in the last few days , of innocent bystanders , in a futile attempt to destabilise the country .
i would say that these three factors are fundamental : firstly , the person authorising the act must have the status of a public official ; secondly , the act is constitutive in nature and does not merely certify a signature ; and thirdly , it must not produce effects other than those it would produce in its country of origin .
our main debate today concerns scientific data on climate change .
the problem is serious and is growing more serious , yet counterfeit and pirated goods continue to be freely available within the internal market .
i am sure that it will also send a strong european message to the public and to economic and social players , a pro - european message , a message of european unity , of confidence in the european governments , including the greek government , and of confidence in our opportunities .
50 % of the illegal immigrants enter the eu legally , but exceed the period of stay because there is no visa control system .
the scientific advice is clear .
we have a downward spiral , a negative spiral , which is a dangerous one .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i wish to speak about the european crime prevention network .
how can it be , mr rehn , that the eurogroup , chaired by mr juncker , could hold a summit without the dutch finance minister present ?
those member states that have started this should know that there should be a pan - european approach , an effective and safe approach .
first of all , and this is how the report begins , too , we have open debate , then there is the constitution and the enforcement of legislation .
there are many causes for this situation .
that is certainly the case in france and germany .
particularly in the case of côte d'ivoire , there was concern over the fact that , actually , there was not really a stable government in the country , and there were concerns over whether you could make a deal with a country in that position .
( it ) mr president , i voted in favour of the report by mr garriga polledo on the forthcoming financial perspectives of the union because , at one of the greatest times of crisis for the so - called european spirit , i am convinced that it is vital for us to insist upon and prevail in our belief that it is essential to provide the union with credible instruments , beginning with adequate funding .
this is beneficial at all levels : private costs in addition to national costs .
these are the practical challenges to which we want to respond .
therefore , this is not primarily a problem of adapting national law .
opening of the sitting
i think it will be a very useful precedential document for us to study , because it seems to me that he robustly supports the scientific justification for the use of gm crops in europe where they are scientifically approved and authorised .
due to all these reasons , it is stressed that the eu requires a more effective approach to migration , which would complement foreign policy instruments .
yet indirectly , we are encouraging oil exploitation in the most vulnerable and fragile part of our globe , where the consequences could be horrific .
when we are discussing the costs of regulations , we must also concern ourselves with the compliance costs , which are ignored at the moment .
we have a duty to heal europe 's public finances and we have a duty to set out responses , which have to begin with the involvement of businesses and the world of work , and have different and more open rules in order to complete the single market and be in a better position to compete on the global market .
what was your response ?
freedom of speech is an important fundamental right . this has been the view voiced in the debate so far .
yes , we should all like to meet energy demands exclusively by means of renewable sources .
only after ratification will the eu be able to say whether the condition it imposed regarding comparable reduction efforts has been implemented .
i hope that the commission will find time to examine this problem more closely in the overall context of the european economic stimulus plan .
in my opinion , this initiative is very important and timely .
i would like to note that questions concerning the protection of minority rights are also dealt with by the council of europe under its framework convention for the protection of national minorities .
any state with the death penalty should ensure proper procedures of evidence collection , prisoner interrogation and fair trials .
my fellow members have avoided mentioning that explicitly : the requesting of dna data , the requesting of fingerprints , the requesting of data on criminal convictions - and all via the system that we created with the prüm convention .
take , for example , guinea - bissau , where more than 50 % of children are not registered .
the council was divided , but had the benefit of unanimity and blocked conciliation .
please come to grips with this subject as well .
the new countries are being phased in and the margin in the agriculture budget is steadily becoming smaller .
however , the work that we are doing aside , it is our wish , at european level , that - through you , at the commission , in particular - the member states assume their share of the responsibility .
it was only thanks to our will to achieve a good result , while of course retaining full respect for community law , and our will to develop an instrument which will fit into the legal system of the eu , and thanks to our desire to work well together , that we could reach the stage at which we are closing the debate today , which will probably lead to our achieving success at first reading .
that is the only way that we can move towards the target of zero fraud in the eu .
today , we inhabit a world where human history seems to be travelling along separate tracks .
most children find that in their own home with their natural parents . many though , get this with their adoptive parents .
do you agree and who should gather the data then ?
the energy 2020 strategy published by the european commission in november also ranks energy efficiency as the highest priority .
it is reasonable that , first , we collect the statistics on the biocide products only .
origin marking ( written declaration ) : see minutes

the eu 's presence in africa is not without its problems ; however , china 's presence is threatening to develop in a highly unfortunate direction .
one absolute innovation is the introduction of a limit value for the quantity of particulates emitted , thus monitoring the output of the ultrafines fraction emitted from the engine .
i fully agree with the findings and recommendations made to the european commission , because they are exceptionally fitting .
we do not need more consultations .
the board of governors of the european schools approved in july 2008 the proposal to use the european parliament reserve of eur 200 000 to make an evaluation of the existing sen policy in the european schools .
moreover , when a person has cancer , it affects them most , but it also affects their family , their employer and society as a whole .
- report : neil parish
as the stabilisation and association processes develop with these countries and they move from potential candidate status to full candidate status , it seems appropriate that their citizens should enjoy greater freedom of movement .
mr president , i only want to take the floor again because , as an author of this resolution , i feel obliged to answer what mrs gill has said .
18 .
that is what we must hope for .
these common principles cannot be traded in member states ' bilateral relations with russia .
i agree with the report 's focus on the role of areas such as education , childcare and financial mechanisms in securing this goal .

one of the aspects of the single market is the effort to avoid limiting the sale of products in another state 's territory by imposing non - tariff barriers , such as quantitative restrictions , the obligation to repeat certification in each country , non - recognition of patents , specific packaging and labelling requirements of products outside common market customs , etc.
extending it to embrace house renovations and repairs would be its greatest asset , because stimulation of the hard - pressed construction sector is very much required , and , to achieve optimum effect , that concession should not be restricted to energy efficiency measures only .
dual - use items and technology (
although i have been in this business for a long time , i learnt something new by being involved in this .

current commitments by the european union are just 50 % of what ipcc reports are calling for as the absolute minimum commitment .
if you do not listen - or perhaps you do not want to hear that we have solved the problem because it does not fit in with your campaign against this regulation - then i am at a loss !
( hu ) mr president , the successful outcome of the irish referendum is a triumph for the whole european concept .
i therefore welcome the commission 's efforts to seek and propose joint solutions , such as using frontex to prevent illegal migration .
that is why i appeal to you today .
social networks have seen a scale of expansion which was not envisaged a few years ago .
if you achieve this , may god reward you , and if not , may he hold you to account .
however , i do believe that all of this is based on a misunderstanding , which can be cleared up .
creativity and capacity for innovation are linked competences which need to be fostered as widely as possible through lifelong learning .
what is important is that , when we provide aid , we should emphasise the fact that we are doing this now because the european union recognises that the threat posed by climate change is a challenge to our civilisation as well as being civilisation 's responsibility .
men have been held in detention for almost ten years on this part of cuban territory for the sole purpose of bypassing us legal jurisdiction and in spite of the lack of evidence against some of them .
this is why the fifth cohesion report is so timely .
( fr ) madam president , i wish to say that mr posselt 's question is pertinent .
mr president , i am not italian , i am not brazilian , i am a citizen of a member state of the european union , and i do not want the union to be a union which has lost its sense of proportion - a union in which a criminal enjoys the same rights as the victims of crimes and their families .
( hu ) multilingualism and intercultural dialogue does not preclude the possibility for those who belong to the same culture and speak the same language to meet and create international organisations and consultative bodies .
the vote on the resolution will take place tomorrow ( thursday 15 january 2009 ) .
there are good reasons why policy has grown in such an organic way , but it seems like a good time to take stock and to move on and , for that ongoing work on the review , i see three lines of action .
we request additional funding for the solvit network that , despite the justified expectation , has not reached the estimated efficiency in solving the legal problems citizens are dealing with on the internal market .
the commission now has a new resource ; it has a new set of instruments at its disposal which , as i have said , are essentially and fundamentally in the hands of the member states .
this brings a confused debate to the fore that has been developing over the ways and possibility of integrating and assimilating the new immigrants flooding into the continent .
however , i agree with the rapporteur that there is a very fine dividing line and , among other things , there is the risk that the funds will be used only to make agriculture more competitive , to the detriment of other sectors in rural areas .
this special report by the ombudsman follows a complaint submitted about the commission 's refusal to disclose three letters sent by porsche ag to the commissioner , mr verheugen , and the commission 's subsequent six extensions of the deadline for submitting its detailed opinion on the ombudsman 's draft recommendation .

although not a member state of the european economic area , switzerland has continued to show interest in cooperating more closely with the union in the field of education , training and youth .
the european commission gave us a text that contained a great deal of food for thought , which we have tried to build on and supplement .
mr president , i therefore believe that the time has come to join forces , for us to realise that the world is not waiting for us , the europeans , and that either we europeans must unite and maintain constructive positions regarding the problems that our citizens are experiencing at the moment , or else europe , as a power , will disappear from the map .
i think it is time the palestinian side , too , made clear that it wants peace .
the question of migratory movements has a security dimension , but it also has a human dimension that should not be ignored .
member of the commission . - mr president , once again i want to thank the committee on agriculture and rural development and mr goepel in particular for their hard work , resulting in an excellent report .
a strong precedent may be established for other ftas waiting in line and coming up soon in the near future .
although no one can argue against the need for such a guaranteed minimum income scheme , it may obviously be open to abuse .
of particular concern are grievances voiced regarding freedom of the media and freedom of assembly and of association .
mr president , from what the previous speakers have said , it is clear that we are all pleased that it will be possible to implement the 2011 eu budget efficiently and without unnecessary delays as of 1 january next year .
honourable members , you will not be surprised that there are some amendments that the commission , after careful reflection , cannot support .
- ( pl ) mr president , slovenia is the first of the new member states to take on the presidency of the european union .
( fr ) mr president , i have no wish to take the floor on behalf of the presidency , but i would like to respond to my fellow member mr pomés ruiz .
this proposal for a regulation contributes to establishing a european energy policy that aims at efficiency , reliability and security .
mr president , i too welcome the new president - in - office and wish him well for the next six months .
there is a need for increased eu support for domestic war crimes investigations and trials and for the copenhagen criteria to include even more support for a well - trained and high - performing judiciary , but the legacy of this is that the tribunal must also contribute to reconciliation and inter - ethnic understanding , and the work of ngos deserves more resources .
i call on the european union 's high representative to support the efforts to hold free elections in zimbabwe , devoid of violence and intimidation .
madam president , i , too , would like to thank the high representative for her words , which struck the necessary note of optimism .
the first issue concerns public confidence in the justice system , which seems extremely important to me , at a time when our democracies , the democracies of the member states , cannot be envisaged without this confidence in the justice system .
the resolution does not respect un security council resolution 1244/99 and even calls on the five member states of the eu , including greece , which have not recognised the unilateral independence of kosovo to do so ; in other words , to violate the un resolution .
the european central bank already has eur 360 billion in financial instruments on its books that are not freely tradable and holds a further eur 480 billion in poorly secured securities .
for a long time , the member states have negotiated with the united states on an individual basis and concluded bilateral agreements .
the existence of a ' pseudo - state ' under ' supervised sovereignty ' , protected by the eu / nato , specifically by means of their ' eulex ' and ' viceroys ' , the ' international civilian representative ' and the ' eu special representative ' , who have judicial , police and customs powers , as well as ' executive functions ' and monitoring functions , constitute unacceptable acts of neo - colonialism .
i also know that we should step up our support for civil society and for people - to - people contacts .
in an earlier debate , i complained about the fact that the council is not present .
such solutions were successful , for example , in the case of standards for compact discs - they can be used in all computers .
failure to do this would lead to the loss of a rich cultural heritage .
it is up to the european parliament to send a signal to bosnia and herzegovina and albania tomorrow .
because the couple are under house arrest they used a webcam link to take part in a hearing of the european parliament on the human rights situation in china .
i would also ask that in the framework of the bonn convention you establish criteria for biofuels but also demand and obtain agreement on the creation of a group of intergovernmental experts on biodiversity , like the ipcc for climate change , because we could help others to put in place tools that we ourselves are introducing but they have not yet introduced .
it invites all the parties concerned to mobilise their efforts to bring it to an end .
it is true that this may be voluntary and that it may be used as an additional tool - as already happens - in suspected cases of drug trafficking , where something is hidden in the body , but not as a replacement for a totally reasonable check which can be very useful and is accepted by everyone .
lastly , to conclude , there are a few timetabling issues : we also have economic governance , the winding - up of the council 's task force , and the commission 's proposals ; a great deal of work will be required to link up this budget with future budgets and the financial perspective .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
in this context , this report takes as its background the negotiations that took place 20 years ago to reach a free trade agreement between the eu and the gulf cooperation council ( gcc ) , making these the oldest trade negotiations initiated by the eu , but which have not been concluded to this day .

i support the request submitted to the commission for creating a public ecodesign database available online .
secondly , i would like to stress the need to promote instruments for monitoring , reporting and verifying , in particular , those of the global monitoring for environment and security ( gmes ) range of services , of the satellites that will provide absolutely vital data in this area .
the people of the fyrom do not deserve to be ostracised in any way .
the use of ict may help older people to become more independent and to remain healthy , and may enhance their quality of life .
these studies have been on the table since the middle of this year .
at the same time , we emphasised the problem of non - tariff barriers , which prevent european businesses from accessing japanese public contracts .
as mrs castex has already said , that simply is not the case .
in the area of translations alone , we can save around eur 11 million annually .
however , it highlights failings in procurement procedures , particularly with regard to the under - estimation of the budgets of framework contracts , which ultimately constitutes an obstacle to fair competition .
we have now had many meetings with the commission to get reassurance on this .
i would appeal to the french and czech council presidencies to take parliament 's ball and to pass it back .
i must fully acknowledge that the general competence in health policy and financing of health policy remains , and will continue to remain , at member state level .
although we agree upon the need to provide the funds as quickly as possible , we regret that the proposal presented by the european commission implies , among other budget headings , a reduction in funding for important community programmes compared with the previous and current multiannual financial framework .
everyone agrees that we have to respect all of the international and environmental conventions , certainly when it comes to the sensitive baltic sea area .
the world is short of food .
even though i often express dissatisfaction in the tiers here in parliament , and when i now look back and see that the dep of opponents are empty and that the vast majority of opponents are not taking part in this debate , i wish to make it quite clear that of course we are also critical of the institutions and we want improvements .
president - in - office of the council . - mr president , the presidency , building on the work carried out by the french presidency , is pursuing actively discussions on the proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council on the application of patients ' rights in cross - border health care .
we had a very rewarding debate on this during parliament 's plenary sitting in september .
please allow me to join the homage to him by his comrades - in - arms in the presence of the most senior national and european authorities , especially our high representative , javier solana , and our colleague karl von wogau .
have you not listened to the people infuriated at how anti - terror laws are being exploited for commercial gain ?
the report on certification of train drivers can be seen , in some respects , as a report on interoperability .
i hope we have all learned the lesson that protectionism only makes recovery harder .
i believe that is the right approach .
if we compare the position of the states neighbouring the eu , then we see that - after russia - the most important partner is ukraine .
for the sake of consistency , why does greece not therefore also insist on calling estonia the ' former soviet republic of estonia ' as a formal title ?
if we only do it when the media 's attention is on those countries or on us , then we will fail .
- mayer report
i express my full support for the report by mr coelho .
let us not make this more of a political issue than is necessary , however .
( el ) madam president , mr lópez garrido , i want to link the question of financial supervision by the european union to speculative action by mutual funds , including funds domiciled in the european union , in the city of london .
although the question of whether or not to include self - employed drivers in the scope of the directive is a genuine dilemma , let me say that it is also a false problem .
madam president , mrs malmström , commissioner , the fact that mr obama and the new majority in congress are presenting us with a significant opportunity to intensify our cooperation , in particular , with regard to the common transatlantic market , has already been mentioned .
in some cases we are cutting back the civil defence which saves us from fires .
it is good that we periodically review and modify provisions in these areas .
but only a united eu can turn what is now perceived as a threat into an opportunity and a step forward in relations with russia .
that is what i usually call ' secular ethics ' and it is the basis of our happy life , our inner peace .
we shall do what we can in the committee on employment and social affairs to contribute to the achievement of that aim .
one of the signs of this is the very low turnout for elections to the european parliament , arising from the widely - held feeling that citizens cannot influence events in the eu through their vote in any way whatsoever .
a responsible constitutional court would necessarily describe such a law as unconstitutional .
i therefore consider that this proposal warrants not only council 's attention but acceptance by council .
with the current directive on the sustainable use of plant protection products we are taking a giant step towards more commonality in european environmental and consumer protection .
another key issue is improving energy efficiency .
i believe that frank sex education for children is relevant to the prevention of sexual abuse of children , but it should also be addressed at parents , educators and social and health professionals .
we must , of course , stress that increased capitalisation of the banks is a necessary precondition for making the financial sector more stable and strong , but it will not be enough .
madam president : i am very pleased that i and my group have persevered in fighting the left 's evil obsession with confiscatory taxation .
the agricultural sector does indeed need to be financed in order to safeguard the sustainability of the sector and food security in europe .
it will make life more complicated for wine - growers and for the entire wine industry .
mr brock , in particular , got it right when he said that there is a mystery in our relationship with things that makes us realise that we have not mastered everything , that however advanced we may be , we have not got the answer to all problems that nature poses to humans and the magnitude of this earthquake reminds us of exactly that .
( de ) mr president - in - office , mr president of the commission , mr president of parliament , i agree with mr karas on one point , namely that it is not about the number of times that the word ' social ' is mentioned but the spirit of the text itself .
in the exercise of its right of scrutiny under the comitology procedure , parliament has raised a number of problems and objections regarding the way the commission implemented the instrument , and the interpretation it gave to some of its core provisions .
however , we accept the scope of the regulation as presented to us , which covers international , not cross - border , services , with the possibility of picking up and setting down passengers between stations within every member state .
there has been more and more populism and nationalism , there is too much political entrenchment , and verbal attacks are being levelled at neighbouring countries .
air agreements now fall within this category .
i urge this house to support the work of the cmp , and to support written declaration 10 which is humanitarian in its objectives and seeks to bring peace and remembrance and reconciliation to these families .
madam president , conditions are far more favourable for embarking on a partnership and cooperation agreement with tajikistan than , for example , uzbekistan or turkmenistan , these latter countries being total dictatorships .
i wish to congratulate president barroso on taking the initiative in 2005 to inaugurate this dialogue with religious leaders ; i also wish to congratulate the presidents of parliament and of the council for maintaining this dialogue on an annual basis .
we must ask the people to decide , by ' yes ' or ' no ' , on principles and fundamentals , not on sophisticated technicalities and complicated compromises .
i apologise for this procedure , but the dramatic events in libya have caused us to consider it important to add a few words .
we have decided to extend this right to petitions , too .
the new emissions standards for heavy - duty vehicles relate to a reduction in pollutants , not in greenhouse gases : the two are sometimes confused .
as you well know , in an important cultural shift , we have decided to complement a traditional ground - based approach with new tools .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , i should like to address some remarks to prime minister janša .
there is no excuse for what was done to georgia .
it is the council 's interpretation that decisions of that nature do require unanimity .
it is also an opportunity for us to see how we can support democratic responses to the structural problems inherent in social cohesion .
i also think that there is room for the proposal made by the second speaker within these directives , which you will be able to debate in this chamber , for example , in relation to the regulation of hedge funds , which is within the supervision requirements which have been discussed , or something which the current president of the council of the union mentioned here this morning , the eradication of tax havens .
the problems of transparency in the european union are concentrated mainly on convergence and harmonisation of the law in member states .
( sl ) madam president , i am pleased to have been given the floor before mr goerens , my colleague from luxemburg , because otherwise that would have undermined the basic point that i am going to make , that we who have been speaking here for the past half hour have been mainly members from south - eastern europe .
firstly , we must target the poorest countries in our cooperation programmes .
i should stress that the european union will continue steadfastly to support georgia in its efforts to find a peaceful settlement of the unresolved conflicts both in abkhazia and south ossetia .
integrated planning clearly allows for the structural funds to be used in a way that will further europe 's cohesion policy objectives .
parallel measures such as a tax on air fuel and charges on nitrogen oxide emissions , nox , are a must , and this is precisely what we are calling for in this report .
( fr ) mr president , my question is very simple .
here in the european parliament today , we are celebrating one of the most important and historic decisions that the european union has taken so far .
so , while we may be proud of this text , we have less to shout about with regard to the timetable : it is not really good enough , in my opinion , to introduce passengers ' rights over a possible 15 - year timescale if our aim - and it is our aim today - is to develop rail travel .
in this case , expulsion shall be based on objective elements and a ban on re - entry cannot be imposed .
on average , each eu citizen produces 25 kg of electronic waste every year .
i will just make three remarks .
what is important now is seriously to consider whether we need to review the legal framework .
it is not a coincidence that one of the innovation partnerships mentioned by the commission is precisely about raw materials , researching ways to recycle and replace raw materials .
instead , we want to remind everyone of how important it is that these hearings cannot be selective in any sense and that the legal proceedings must be open and must be non - discriminatory .
a solution should have been found by now .
she knows very well that the commission supported her proposals .
5 .
this includes measures designed to discourage and prevent fraud and theft of personal data .
faced with a choice between democracy and supra - nationalism , the european union almost always opts for supra - nationalism and nowhere is this clearer than in its policy in the western balkans .
this is a step in the right direction and a sensible response to those economic challenges .
just as in poland , where totalitarianism did not fall because of words , but because of deeds , so european solidarity will be effective if it is translated into specific action .
i believe that this will provide another show of support and an original guarantee of the high quality of our products .
the commission proposal has been submitted to the council .
in the area of international and trade relations , russia also needs a partner that is more stable and reliable than china or iran .
international relations can indeed provide a great deal of help here .
to this end , we also need rules and regulations .
i think that the citizens of europe deserve better than that .
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - mr president , can i first of all welcome the new commissioner to his post .
the objective of this report was precisely to eliminate that contradiction , and now we can harmonise the member states ' legislation that pertain to standards of animal welfare in slaughtering or killing .
the political elites of four or five countries in the latest 2004 enlargement have not , in my view , either understood or taken on board european policy or the community acquis .
mr president , as you can see , i had two minutes left .
the agreement between the islamic north and the non - islamic south , reached after a long internal war , is under pressure .
( de ) mr president , i would ask members to take note of what this item on the agenda is actually about .
( de ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , we should highlight the fact that , in the light of the continuing structural crisis in our member states , the european parliament is taking a cautious approach to its budgetary plans for 2012 .
here we also need to act in the international dimension to be most effective .
the recent appointment of coordinators for projects encountering technical , political or financial difficulties is a step in the right direction .
what we have not seen , and what we should see , given that the accounts have been very biased , is what happened in ossetia .
lastly , our group calls upon the council to make swift progress on the economic governance package and to take proper account of the european parliament 's position as co - legislator on four out of the six proposals under discussion .
restrictive measures affecting the rights of individuals following the entry into force of the lisbon treaty ( debate )
i want to congratulate the rapporteur , mrs neves , on her hard work in bringing together different positions into a consistent document .
this is a very real risk i can envisage .
on the other hand , it is also clear to me that we are talking about the interim agreement today .
well , new technology brings new challenges : considerable economic challenges .
however , we are continuing with the same policy in portugal and in greece again , rather than admit our mistake .
many of us believe that this is not the way forward , but you have taken the decision to subordinate your own country to something that must be considered jointly .
in writing . - ( sv ) we can see that desperate attempts are being made to build a european nation with its own national identity .
in this case , the commission proposed to mobilise the solidarity fund to provide eur 31 255 790 for portugal and eur 35 635 750 for france , making a total of eur 66 891 540 .
this is also the basis for the proposals in the report .
in east germany , there was no data protection , no democracy and there were no fundamental rights for citizens - three important factors that are fundamental to our cooperation .
on the other hand , however , the commission must be given the task of examining the conditions required to make such measures possible in the first place .
we are now within sight of the finishing line .
the aim of this draft recommendation is to help member states deal with rare diseases more effectively , more efficiently and more globally .
the delegation will be mandated to voice parliament 's concerns on the hrc 's work and will report to the subcommittee on human rights during its visit .
i am very sorry for that because the lisbon treaty deserves visible protest .
in 2000 the eu had 450 000 tonnes of olive oil in storage , and the eu decided to run advertising campaigns in the northern countries to inform us how good and beneficial olive oil was .
europe definitely needs a common approach to immigration in the eu .
i will say nothing more than that in respect of the yellow - bellies on my right , but they certainly are disingenuous at best !
the next item on the agenda is the debate on six motions for a resolution concerning belarus .
since the present structure of the european union is vastly different from what it was in 1957 , we have to adopt a new european document ; we need clear new rules .
the june list believes that it is very important for member states in the european area to be in a good economic position and is in favour of an independent european neighbourhood policy .
only in that way we can stop the distribution of counterfeit products and eradicate the black market in medicines .
this is quite simply going too far if we ever want to be taken seriously as a legislative assembly .
( de ) mr president , the economy , the environment and people - these are the three cornerstones within which we must fit european law relating to road charging and the eurovignette .
do you have any comment on this ?
i should like to ask the commission how it intends to follow up on scientific research efforts in this area , to intensify these efforts , and to translate the results of this research into benefits for europeans in the light of the europe 2020 strategy .
the first is cabotage and the date that the european parliament deemed right to set , in other words automatic liberalisation in 2014 .
as is customary with european union legislation , the commission was asked , after a certain time , to submit a report on the application and implementation of the statute in order to draw conclusions about whether there is a need for amendments to this legal act .
energy market integrity and transparency (
it had a rather difficult start , having been formally launched in the 80s and undergoing its first reform in 2002 .
as an example of action at european level , we will develop a more integrated european standardisation system as an important platform for sharpening the competitive edge of our companies , particularly smes .
at the same time , member states might be imposing congestion charges in large cities on hard - pressed motorists who have no choice .
the directive is indispensable in order that victims of violence can feel comparatively safe throughout the european union , regardless of where they are living .
sport is an effective means by which to promote social integration and mutual understanding at national and international level .
we are still not allowing enough children with special education needs into the schools , so we are still missing out on 15 % .
yet i feel that the compromise has also resolved that aspect well because , as has been said , for the first time the scope of the two directives , in article 1 , includes the recognition of fundamental rights and freedoms as well as internet access .
but meanwhile , important changes have occurred .
it was a present for the big sugar concerns , which moved their production out of europe , and today we import sugar from them .
the eu now needs to consider a substantial reinforcement of targeted measures against rajoelina and his henchmen and cronies and , if necessary , to invoke the cotonou agreement 's provisions on failures of governance and to apply the necessary sanctions .
the current financial and economic crisis poses massive challenges for the automotive and supply industry .
it is particularly concerning that in many states , funds from industrial nations have been used to keep dictators or ruling classes in power and to suppress the poor masses .
so we will have to mobilise .
big business is exerting pressure for greater and faster reform of the cap and for it to be adapted to the rules of the wto , so that the multinationals can garner even more land , consolidate their sovereignty in the production and marketing of food and strengthen their position in international competition .
it is not the commission 's money ; it is not meps ' money .
during the process of awarding contracts for the galileo deployment phase , the commission has strictly applied the principle of reciprocity and we hope that this has given a boost to the negotiations with third countries on the mutual opening up of markets .
it also requires support to help rebuild its national institutions and civil society .
please put it to the vote again so that people can make the right decision .
politicians in the eu should create sustainable and beneficial frameworks for society and companies rather than involving themselves in controlling every detail .
the rapporteur 's proposal is that the names of those with parental responsibility should be printed in the child 's passport .
secondly , it will dedicate special attention to energy efficiency , renewable sources of energy , biofuels , to carbon dioxide capture and storage and generally a transition to a low carbon economy .
the implementation of the european semester , the adoption of the permanent stability mechanism , along with the commitments made before parliament , including the legislative package , which will have to be balanced by parliament , are all steps in the right direction .
those in the south want to have a more institutionally defined framework for economic integration .
in writing . - while we recognise that cuba is a communist tyranny and while we want to see cuba transformed to a peaceful democratic state , we do not recognise the eu in this process .
therefore , we must not forget these deeply human starting points when we consider the economic and social future of our union , that is to say our strategy for growth and employment .
it is obvious however that the 2001 european legislation governing this right of access needs to be brought up to date .
on the contrary , this commission , and i am sure also this parliament , should be active - and we could be even more active together - in promoting a european citizens ' agenda .
the aim is to have a full - scale roll - out of ecall by 2010 .
i always speak as i find , even when my opinions run counter to those who spoke before me .
with such a small budget , it will be difficult to put into effect the priorities drafted by both the european commission and parliament , especially as these priorities are distinctly increasing with each year that goes by .
unfortunately , he missed the opportunity .
last but not least , apiculture products are used not only for food consumption , but also become ingredients in products .
i am thinking , for example , of the european union agency for fundamental rights .
we recognised then the need to act more broadly to introduce a horizontal directive to combat all forms of discrimination throughout the whole of society .
however , i believe that the amendments tabled by the rapporteur are important .
secondly , i would like to make access to public contracts easier , especially in terms of cross - border participation by small and medium - sized enterprises .
it is difficult , however , to believe that democracy could be strengthened in belarus merely through eu coercion .
i know how important this is for the ordinary citizens of the western balkans .
opening of the sitting
today 's vote will enable european agricultural tractor manufacturers to deal with the more stringent exhaust emission limits imposed by the entry into force of stage iii b of directive 2000/25 / ec .
you know that 2007 is a year to be forgotten as quickly as possible because certain countries did not honour their commitments , which eclipsed the good behaviour of others who , for their part , showed they were able to do so .
unfortunately , we have not , and that is why this debate is not about figures , this debate is about ethics and politics , it is a debate that qualifies or disqualifies us in the eyes of those who call us to account .
today the industry is asking the commission to accept another exemption from the 2006 reach regulation , already granted for a limited period , for chrysotile asbestos fibres .
i feel that the sum of eur 100 million is not sufficient to achieve the objectives being proposed .
their crime was that they were young homosexuals who dared to love one another .
the structural dialogue we introduced this year , the intense communication between the committees and the commissioners really paid off .
nowadays , member states are facing economic , financial and social crises , creating the need more than ever for solidarity and respect for the union 's basic principles .
that is why our cooperation should be closely linked to improvements in the fields of human rights and the rule of law .
this means , in fact , that there would be eur 22 million in the combined reserve on staff salaries , and i really hope that parliament will be able to reconsider its position on this in the plenary session .
for that reason , barriers that are still in place need to be removed and procedures simplified , while existing programmes need to be expanded and promoted .
they have a high priority , not only somewhere like the arctic , but in other areas of the globe as well .
however , there is no room for complacency .
it is a step in the right direction .
this is not expressed sufficiently in the resolution , which is why i did not vote in favour .
it is right that you should work together with the council .
therefore , they must continue to use their local currency , and this is giving rise to harmful , devastating consequences at present .
the new bilateral agreement with morocco preserves the interests of the european producers by maintaining the system of monthly tariff quotas of tomatoes and strict control of the quantities imported .
i think this is progress .
however , conservatives do not support the concept of an eu discrimination directive .
( applause )
obviously the commission has a major role to play in the application of european law as the guarantor of application of the treaties , but it must do this in conjunction with the legislative bodies , and it certainly cannot replace the legislative powers conferred by the treaties on parliament and the council .
in short , this probably would have been a redistribution of roles under the worst of circumstances .
on the other hand , the romanian authorities must provide , in keeping with eu procedures , the cofinancing portion for implementing the projects so that they can be implemented as quickly as possible once the eu money has been received .
we have , in fact , tried to prepare a document - which i hope will be approved - that can be presented to the council of 29 and 30 october .
( el ) mr president , 1 december was world aids day , a day of remembrance for all the victims of the disease which remains the scourge of our planet .
your position today has convinced me that you will make waves during the six months of your presidency .
it is money that belongs to our citizens , and they must have a right to know what it is being spent on .
the process of strengthening relations between the european union and the countries of the southern caucasus , including georgia , is vital if we are to create a solid , coherent and effective foreign policy .
have you received a response ?
commissioner , i do not want to talk to you about politics this afternoon ; i do not want to talk to you about the middle east , conflicts , bargaining or prisoner exchanges .
mr president , i rise to speak in favour of the financial transaction tax ( ftt ) .
to conclude , there are those who claim that frontex is somehow not respecting , or does not have the mandate to respect , human rights .
he has been my special adviser since 1 april 2006 and his mandate was renewed in 2008 for the period from 1 april 2008 to 31 march 2009 .
furthermore , such a programme would not be acceptable to some of the member states as it would be tantamount to a cutting back of the balancing out arrangement and also of the quotas .
there is no objective standard for taxation , and it is therefore not possible to accuse those states that apply low company taxation levels of fiscal dumping .
the fund provides an annual amount of eur 500 million for such cases .
is it not too high or too low ?
there is currently no such stimulation , as much of the eu market is covered by monopolies and is therefore closed to non - original after - market spare parts .
we hope that the commission and the council will in future take account of this message from parliament .
we want to gain the trust of ordinary citizens in the european union and i hope that this will be the attitude of all the members in this parliament .
increasing education and awareness of both their rights and obligations , as well as a responsible attitude on the part of companies , will contribute to a more dynamic form of cross - border trade and , as a result , to the close integration of the internal market , with an impact on european competitiveness .
despite the fact that during our mission , we were assured that the country was clearly on the path of regime change to parliamentary democracy , and that the security situation had calmed down , only shortly after our departure from bishkek , unrest started again , and the political parties began to challenge the election results .
that is what you fought for together , whether blue or orange .
external action requires dialogue and close cooperation with the countries of origin and transit .
the resolutions , as they are currently worded , are a watered down version of what we started out with at the beginning of the week .
this is not about the ban on prostitution or discrimination against sex workers .
what is desirable is for all the players , all those that are part of the global economy , and in particular , the exchange markets , to keep to the guidelines that we agreed in the g 7 , in the international monetary fund , in the multilateral consultations , that took place a year ago now , in order to try to deal with the global imbalances in the economy .
this vote refers to certain council acts in the field of the common agricultural policy .
i do not believe that we put the same rigour on imported food products as we do internally .
then we shall need the corresponding legislative initiatives to consolidate the process .
it is the commission 's proposal , as amended by mr lehne , and that makes my decision quite simple : the lack of clarity and the problems contained in this proposal overshadow the positive aspects of the reform , and there is an imminent risk of us having a statute that will run counter to its purpose .
mr liese , emissions trading in the us was not rejected by the president but was defeated in the senate , in which the party that holds the majority could well be providing the president the next time round .
what happened in ireland in the referendum was not a victory for democracy .
i therefore support and welcome the proposal for a regulation of parliament and of the council on european environmental economic accounts , as i believe that this will contribute to policy evaluation , particularly by making data available concerning the environmental impact of economic activities .
who are your allies ?
now we find that the repression is still continuing against the baha'i religious minority , against homosexuals - and i particularly call for the release of imprisoned homosexuals , who are sentenced to death in some cases - against the opposition - with more than 2 500 of the opposition imprisoned - against press freedom - only this monday we saw the newspaper farhang - e - ashti closed down for publishing a statement by mr mousavi , the opposition leader - and against the kurdish minority .
furthermore , the commission had adopted policies that aim at reducing racist content online .
by this i mean the right of every child to grow up in an intact environment .
i voted in favour of mr manders 's own - initiative report , which focuses particular attention on the topic of video games .
it should be considered as an example of best practice .
i supported my colleague , mrs estrela 's , calls for an improvement in the health and safety at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding .
i can assure him that it is a very complicated issue , but we are involved actively in dialogue with libya , with switzerland , with the member states , in order to find a solution to this very complicated problem before it escalates even further .
therefore , one of key articles in this resolution is the one which reaffirms our solidarity with the people of pakistan , who share the objectives of democratic governance and transparent , accountable rule , and who act with courage and determination in the face of terrorist and criminal violence .
3 .
in writing . - ( ro ) i welcome the position that the european parliament has adopted regarding the construction of a gas pipeline to connect russia to germany .
on behalf of the ind / dem group . - mr president , i quote from a speech made on this subject by my colleague , godfrey bloom , on 25 october 2006 : ' the thought , the idea or the concept that the united kingdom 's energy supplies could possibly be controlled by some sort of arrangement with a gangster like putin is absolutely ludicrous .
this is a highly relevant report given that the pay gap in the european union is a reality that should be eliminated .
( nl ) mr president , for many reasons the resolution we have just voted on was unacceptable to me and certainly to my group too .
the primary objective of the ppe - de group is to increase eco - innovation within the union , in order that the eu economy may be the most competitive in low carbon emission technologies .
to conclude , the commission has paid considerable attention to the cost element as part of the impact assessment .
in other words , the rebels , aided by sudan , arrived from darfur .
these negotiations , which were conducted in the context of the doha round , involve not only the latin american countries , but also the african , caribbean and pacific group of states ( acp ) and the us , which have pledged to end the disputes in the wto over the eu 's banana import regime and with which the eu maintains trade relations .
we are calling for comparable , effective , consistent and complete data .
finally , after 10 years of institutional impasse , the european union can resume its trajectory of growth , which was unexpectedly cut short some time ago , by strengthening the codecision procedure .
today , we know that there are lots of differences , which is , of course , very hard to understand in the same european union with the same international conventions and the same european values .
lastly , on 16 march 2009 , the council adopted a resolution on the eu customs action plan to combat intellectual property rights infringements for the years 2009-2012 , following on from the abovementioned council resolution of 25 september 2008 .
what do i note from all the studies carried out ?
we fully agree with the european data protection supervisor that using biometrics in information systems is never an insignificant choice , especially when the system in question concerns such a huge number of individuals .
can i say to those who have that idea , be very careful , because i have a suspicion that a toolbox without an optional instrument is potentially actually more invasive of national law than a toolbox with an optional instrument that is voluntary , that respects the autonomy of the parties and is not detrimental to national law .
if one of these preconditions is lacking , though , you will not get europeans to give up more sovereignty to these institutions that we currently find ourselves in .
as afghanistan will make or break the fight against international terrorism , additional budgetary efforts are more than welcome .
they were handed down sentences ranging from 10 to 15 years .
has that been checked , before an emergency incident occurs ?
as shadow rapporteur for the pse group , i am committed to this objective and therefore urge members to vote in favour of this report tomorrow .
the european union must help this country to turn its back on this trade by fighting it both here and there and by a return to development based on that country 's own resources .
together we have tried , in the report on the ufm , to support a different vision of our mediterranean .
this is why we must certify legal websites which , in future , will have a link to the website of the national approval body .
at this level of implementation , it is too early to state whether the eff achieved its objectives .
firstly , the specificity of sporting activities and sporting rules and
2 .
it has to be said that parliament and the council took the lead in this codecision procedure by extending the scope of the future regulation to include insurance and carriage of goods contracts and by clarifying the rules on overriding mandatory provisions and mandatory rules .
for instance , the objective of stopping the loss of biodiversity by 2010 cannot be achieved , and the strategies proposed for protecting the marine environment and the soil will give no concrete results by 2012 .
moreover , the financing has still not been clarified .
this is a work in progress and the commission will present a report every three years on the implementation of the initiative .
i am going to give my opinion on the various nominations , addressing the different points in a slightly different order .
member states that face economic problems could provide skilled labour to germany .
the commission has unfolded a number of initiatives .
the czech member referred to the saying that help given quickly is twice as effective .
within this framework , you , commissioner , along with the members of the college , have decided to renew the employment guidelines and this parliament intends to acknowledge that decision .
and we are quite sure that , working hand - in - hand with the slovenian presidency and with prime minister janša , we will achieve concrete results for our citizens .
we must continuously exchange good practice in this area throughout the eu .
this makes it a key report for a strategic sector for the european union .
mr president , i would like categorically to support this motion .
if we make a mistake , however , we must undo it .
it is a shame , however , that the text does not focus on the intrinsically unequal nature of neoliberalism .
i think that this notion is neither feasible nor fair .
such a gruesome performance of sadistic behaviour is easy to condemn but hard to understand using humanly accepted parameters of societal psychology .
they want to know where the fish was caught or raised ; also they want to know whether the products respect the environment and whether they have been fished sustainably .
in this regard , we share the view of the council 's legal services that the only possible legal basis in place of article 37 of the ec treaty regarding the common agricultural policy is article 308 , as otherwise it would clearly constitute an encroachment on the national competences of the member states .
the european commission is proposing through the motor vehicle block exemption regulation to remove the current exemption in the automotive sector and introduce general competition rules .
it should not be seen as a simple transformation of the intergovernmental initiative , but rather as a real tool which , based on experience , will bring real added value , both through the impetus it may give to the promotion of european values by member states or local authorities and in terms of our citizens ' knowledge of these values .
in order to be effective , it should be a global tax , and i support measures to introduce such a charge on financial transactions .
public service and private sector broadcasting have a crucial role to play with regard to european audiovisual production , cultural diversity and identity , information , pluralism , social cohesion , the promotion of fundamental freedoms and the functioning of democracy .
if there is , tell me .
this was a wise decision , but in any case we can achieve a better result and this new rule will help to make questions more effective , so i congratulate the rapporteur , mr corbett .
the question is whether , on the one hand , we are brave enough to be the first to take action and make the necessary sacrifices , and on the other hand , how we will share the burden among the various social and economic actors .
the adoption of a less polluting policy would improve the quality of life of the 490 million of european citizens .
mr president , barely noticed , south america and central america are sliding into a form of autocracy - a kind of neo - caudillismo .
i have already mentioned that our offer , our eastern partnership , does not mean that we approve of everything that is happening in our neighbouring countries .
i would like to thank the rapporteur particularly for attempting to reconcile two positions which emerged in the committee on this issue .
i say that because i think it from the very depths of my european convictions .
i voted to waive her immunity .
i must stress that mrs marie panayotopoulos - cassiotou is very active in my committee and i congratulate her on her working attitude that is always responsible .
it may not be a final barrier to membership of the eu , but we cannot in all honestly just sweep it under an all too convenient turkish carpet .
rapporteur . - ( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank my fellow members who have spoken in support of this report , as well as mr barrot for his support and the work the commission is undertaking to amend certain directives , particularly the asylum procedure directive , demonstrating a willingness to improve the common asylum system .
this has increased climate change to a level which is now causing humanity serious problems .
europe continues to sell arms that are being used to kill civilians .
indeed , the agreement on the new treaty was announced before midnight on 18 october .
an estimated 40 % of fish were caught without licences or in violation of regulations .
for this reason , i voted in favour of the renewal of the agreement between the ec and ukraine .
it is the wrong approach , and i wonder , if the commission is so aloof towards us meps , what its attitude is towards ordinary european citizens ?
obviously , when civil protection resources are used , it must be in accordance with the international guidelines as set out in the european consensus .
you did not choose me , mr schulz , and i did not choose you , but it is our duty to work together .
the blind tightening up of our standards may have the consequence of putting europe at risk , and i confess that i totally disagree with the hidden introduction of european taxes under the pretext of combating climate change .
this kind of attitude will be of little use to us if we wish to make progress in terms of democracy , and this house operates with consensus , not blinkered postures .
this version is considered therefore to offer sufficient guarantees .
thank you for reminding us of that and for making that nice mention .
the proposal has three elements .
what does that mean ?
this is not yet a food crisis , but this is a country that imports 90 % of its food , so we must be ready .
this area is currently striving to reach a new balance following the entrance of new actors , the eu included , after being considered a closed lake for so many years during the cold war .
in writing . - i welcome this resolution , which reaffirms parliament 's commitment to the dual broadcasting system , in which private and public service media play their respective roles , independent of political and economic pressure , and calls for access to broadcasting of the highest level to be ensured irrespective of consumers ' and users ' ability to pay .
( bg ) i believe that the reports by mr danjean and mr albertini mark a step towards our much needed common vision for the european union as a global player in safeguarding peace and security , and i congratulate them on this .
firstly , i would like to focus on consumer empowerment and i would like to highlight the need to raise the level of financial literacy .
it is worth emphasising that this new proposal provides for the same distribution of burdens for all market players involved in trade , whether they be producers , importers or merchants .
the commission is very much attached to this fundamental principle .
mr president , the arctic plays an increasingly important geo - strategic role in the world , and we are now faced with the opening of hitherto closed seaways as a direct result of global climate change .
hence , the targets that we set ourselves are too ambitious and , at times , too inflexible .
people are being evicted who were already evicted in 2005 in operation murambatsvina , which incidentally means ' clean out the trash ' .
i am glad parliament has finally initiated an in - depth examination of this issue .
when i say that , and when we include suggestions in this area in the annual growth survey , it does not mean that we would question the importance of the social dialogue - quite the contrary .
i did so because the issue in question is an example of respect for the rule of law .
hmg 's view :
can the european car industry be left in a position of seriously distorted competition with its us competitors without the question being asked as to what european sectoral policies exist to protect european industry ?
( el ) mr president , my fellow members have covered the basic issues of today 's debate .
the commission will continue to work together with member states at the technical level in the experts ' groups to define difficulties and clarify interpretation issues in relation to the directive .
after all , the ongoing harmonisation of criminal law provisions across the member states is a fundamental condition for the creation of a european area of freedom , security and justice .
therefore , i will briefly outline the three stages of this new dimension of european law .
for me , the key issue is raising awareness and i believe these reports will help achieve this .
11 .
since euro 3 vehicles are less polluting than the other most polluting vehicles in the euro emission categories , the double charge system will apply to them only from a later date , while it will already be applicable to the other categories from the effective date of the directive .
these tests are essential , because we have to make sure that our populations regain confidence in our nuclear power stations .
commission communication on action against cancer : european partnership (
it provides an important added value for both the market and consumers .
those provisions are there , they bind us at the moment and there is no reason to have to suffer any intimidation from our american friends .
it is an extremely balanced piece of work in that it states very clearly what action must be taken to improve the instrument .
that being the case , the council - including your own country , madam secretary of state - provisionally halted this initiative .
the brazilian authorities now also require that bovine animals whose meat is destined for the eu market are individually identified and registered in a database .
alongside the diverse measures which the union is taking , i would like to propose two specific measures , because it seems to me they are missing .
it was that government which showed us that the right direction for poland to take was not only freedom and democracy , but also integration with the european union .
france must not be allowed to favour rum producers in its overseas departments by lower taxes than permitted .
( hu ) mr president , ' i desire mercy and not sacrifice ' : the words of jesus echo in our souls when we encounter rampant violence and cruelty in the world .
i am pleased with the choice of 9 may as europe day : it commemorates 9 may 1950 , when the french foreign minister , robert schuman , in his speech in the salon de l'horloge at the quai d'orsay , outlined publicly jean monnet 's idea to bring together coal and steel production under the umbrella of a supranational high authority , thereby pooling the resources necessary for munitions .
in the places i visited , there is no volunteer fire service .
subject : combating poverty
i am sure that the commission will return to this later .
these agreements are aimed at opening up the banana market by strengthening the dominant position of the large us multinationals , which already control more than 80 % of the world market .
i voted for this resolution criticising the deteriorating situation of the press in europe , especially in italy , and which thereby demanded legislation on media mergers .
it will be a shot in the arm for our economy , for employment and the environment , of course , and entirely feasible , on the basis of the commission 's roadmap 2050 calculations .
mr president , to answer mr mitchell on this serious issue , the eu still has serious concerns over iran 's nuclear programme and the country 's lack of interest in responding fully to the concerns raised by the possible military dimension of this programme .
let me give you the raw and scary statistics : in 1974 , the nations of western europe accounted for 36 % of world gdp ; today it is 26 % ; in 2020 it will be 15 % .
since then , the messages coming from the yemeni leadership have been less clear .
mrs bauer has noted that in the so - called male professions the work of women is routinely undervalued for no objective reason .
therefore , i believe that spain 's recourse to the forum of dialogue on gibraltar as a measure which can genuinely enable us to manage such situations and prevent further undesirable incidents should conclude this matter for us all .
we are spurred on by the need to adopt joint european responses and take a global lead .
i voted in favour of the european parliament resolution on the future of partnership .
tomorrow , on 24 october , we will be celebrating the 63rd anniversary of the united nations .
mr president , tibetans , like all nations , have the aspiration to live under their own laws and their own people , and , in denying their national aspirations , the chinese government uses a series of arguments about abolishing feudalism and overcoming serfdom and superstition .
the market access strategy , and particularly the market access partnership launched in 2007 , is the centrepiece of the commission 's work in that respect .
i think that the reference to ' hidden ' advertising mechanisms that have developed on the internet and are now in use there is appropriate ; in many cases the advertising is disguised as opinions or comments on social networking sites , forums or blogs .
action taken on parliament 's positions and resolutions : see minutes
in the case of kosovo , that means contributing in particular to strengthening of the rule of law , respect for human rights and the protection of minorities , as well as encouraging economic development and working for the protection of kosovo 's rich cultural and religious heritage .
( lt ) i greatly welcome the decision adopted on new rules in the fishing sector .
( ro ) in order to best use the opportunities provided by globalization , the european union should modernize its social policies and invest mainly in human resources .
it was not the usual roll - call of requests and donor pledges .
we are providing finance for a whole series of labour - intensive programmes , including road construction and upgrading , small - scale maintenance projects and so on , that will provide people with work .
because i am aware that this is a very important area , i am in favour of the necessary human and financial resources being set aside for the protection of the rights of the child .
we believe that , at a time of great economic difficulty , the political decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market purely in order to make money is not very wise .
although the member states of the european union are among the richest countries in the world , new types of poverty and inequality are still emerging .
high - quality public finances and economic policies are , in fact , in the long run , more than ever necessary .
4 .
the irish voted ' no ' , so why is it then not over ?
i was party to president sarkozy 's extremely clear message to mr déby .
this is true of our partners from developed countries most of all , because we must ensure that they display greater willingness in making more determined progress towards drastically reducing emissions .
the ecb 's additional role during the crisis has been to expand liquidity provisions through the use of non - standard measures .
first of all , it seems to me that the debate has clearly shown that parliament 's welcomes the idea of social reality stocktaking , and though i agree with mr cercas that diagnosis is not the same as therapy , i am also of the opinion that no therapy is possible without diagnosis .
we also appreciate your comments on immigration , although not always your actions , and we appreciate the fact that emphasis has been placed on the positive aspects of immigration and not just on its illegality , as perhaps your predecessor did .
the problem lies in the fact that the time when it would be appropriate to put into practice the idea of closer cooperation , going further than the european neighbourhood policy , which has been of little benefit to ukraine so far , is actually coming .
we need to make the land that we have productive .
what measures does the commission envisage adopting with this in mind ?
this is for the purpose of benefiting from adequate access to medical care , except for the cases in which it can be proved that the given persons can benefit from adequate treatment and medical care in their own country of origin .
the statement ' made in europe ' is a guarantee for the consumer , and also a guarantee about how the product has been created .
romania is the european state which probably allowed the worst abuses to be committed regarding international adoption in the 1990s , immediately after the fall of communism .
it is true that chinese competition is unfair because of low wages , lack of political and trade union rights , counterfeiting and the undervalued currency .
is anyone ready to speak ?
it gave the member states the opportunity to set criteria on the basis of which funds would be distributed , channelling them , above all , to those producers who needed them most .
i am going to focus on two reports , given their importance .
notwithstanding the european union 's commitment to multiculturalism , we need to make sure that the relentless tide of political correctness emanating from eu legislation does not impinge upon our determination to stamp out this vile practice .
madam president , on behalf of the british taxpayer , i beg you to stop this rip - off .
i would also like to thank the committee on legal affairs for its positive contribution .
it is not surprising if there is no strong message on this from eu interlocutors .
commissioner , it is not true that workers can decide for themselves .
it is a sad statement of fact that although we have been since 2004 a full member of the european union where free movement of people is guaranteed , although we are schengen members and , as i believe , soon we will also be members of the economic and monetary union , to this date the citizens of our country still have to cope with obstacles and a lack of transparency concerning employment and they often find themselves in jobs that are below their qualifications in spite of their education level or work under far worse financial conditions than their colleagues .
the next item is the statement by the vice - president of the commission and high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy on the situation in côte d'ivoire .
therefore , no one should worry , and if my fellow members worry about this , i hope that this is not a deficit of solidarity on their part with those member states - for instance , with my country , hungary - which , in their opinion , will not use these funds appropriately .
we voted in favour of compulsory labelling of pharmaceutical products since we believe that consumers have the right to know where their medicines and so on come from .
fifteen years ago in ireland , drug addiction was confined to dublin .
however , when the chief medical officer of the slovak republic called on the public to get vaccinated , it became a joke and no one believed him .
in the face of this situation , our group considers that trade must be a tool to serve objectives such as job creation , the reduction of inequalities and sustainable development .
( ro ) dear colleagues , i will present three issues very briefly .
information should be provided on the basis of accessibility , consistency and absolute transparency , because we believe that many regions expect the commission to show greater energy in relation to the objective expressed here .
( de ) madam president , mr alvaro , you have just demonstrated how to extend your speaking time by accepting numerous questions .
it is a success because we managed to set a minimum and maximum rate of excise duty to meet anti - inflationary objectives but ignored the idea of abolishing regulation in its entirety .
we advocate the definition of clear guidelines on the best way of collaborating to promote political stability , fight climate change , manage migratory flows and prevent natural disasters .
i wish to remain non - committal , and i trust that the wording of the proposal for a regulation , based on a text already adopted in the klaß report , is non - committal .
we know that you are taking the first steps in this direction .
we want drastically to cut back on agricultural and regional aid and reduce the total budget .
to my mind , such a person should focus on the workings of the eu and on limited areas where there is clear added value from joint action .
we do not really need studies and analyses .
i also believe that it is high time that all information on the famine is made public .
i admit that the words from the swedish presidency and from president barroso are encouraging in that respect .
we have to wait for this communication to be produced .
it also makes this legislation important in terms of simplifying and harmonising the way in which we handle products in europe that can be used for both civil and military purposes .
the last aspect for evaluation is the council 's position on breaches of human rights within the european union , in connection with the cia 's activities .
commission legislative and work programme for 2010 ( debate )
the principle of loyalty between the different institutions is very important .
so can i ask for a statement from the commission , insisting that developers seeking european funding start applying for planning permission now .
few citizens believe in it .
what we need is for the people of campania and naples to be brave and vote to replace their incompetent officials , as has already happened at regional level .
the children are aged four and fourteen .
at the same time , i would very much like it if this debate was not an anti - russian one , because those present in this house , those who take the floor , should be familiar with the ethnic map of ukraine , and should know which counties were affected by this stalinist horror , by means of which the communist dictatorship strove to exterminate the peasantry - for the most part those who died were ukrainians , but not exclusively ukrainians .
i am convinced that if regulations were to be introduced in this field , they would be welcomed by all mobile phone owners .
i am not suggesting that is all you were doing , but , rather than just talking about the issue , what are we actually going to do to make it happen ?
when the social democrats governed sweden it was a foregone conclusion that women who had been violated in sweden - irrespective of whether it was a result of people trafficking , marriage or whether they had been subjected to violence - had a right to stay .
( pt ) madam president , indifferent to the economic and social devastation caused by the structural changes approved by the international monetary fund ( imf ) in countries like greece , the leaders of the european union are now stepping up their offensive and launching themselves on portugal with the same approach and unbridled colonial arrogance .
this measure will allow approximately eur 180 billion of liquid funds to be put back into circulation : this is the amount of the overall debt owed by public administrations to businesses throughout the eu .
here the commission will also assess the economic impact of including aircraft with one or more turbojet engines or turboprops .
in british prisons we have various assorted serial killers , rapists , child - murdering paedophiles , necrophiles and cannibals serving life sentences .
the european popular party has a positive outlook on the establishment of the asylum support agency because it considers it to be an important step forward in the establishment and implementation of a common asylum policy within the european union .
in this regard , should such a similar incident - or just a grave deterioration - occur , the council could take similar measures or even consider a suspension , and the commission would certainly consider all available options , including suspension .
the new democracy ( nd ) government and its meps who have actively supported today 's decision are largely responsible .
our fate is in your hands , but you must have the courage to take the initiative now .
these are all good proposals , but they do not take into account the state of degradation in which many roma communities in certain member states , such as italy , find themselves , often by choice .
the kurdish issue , including its cultural and economic aspects , must likewise be addressed .
the commitments entered into by the merging parties include , most notably , the divesture of suez shares in distrigas , the belgian gas incumbent , which has , as you are aware , also entered the french market , the divesture of gdf shares in the alternative belgian gas and electricity provider spe and the abandonment of any control , by law or de facto , suez has over the belgian gas transmission network operator fluxys .
in addition , financial supervisory authorities only represent part of the overall solution .
i want to warmly thank all my fellow members for their proposals , especially the shadow rapporteurs , the pse secretariat and the committee on industry , research and energy because , with their help , we have managed - i believe - to strengthen the directive on energy labelling .
this area will be the largest area of inter - regional cooperation ; it will highlight the lack of progress in the multilateral negotiations in question and in inter - regional negotiations .
there are many positive objectives in the report , such as working for public health and against discrimination , and accessibility for disabled persons , but in spite of that there are too many calls and demands for detailed regulations which should not be made at eu level .
i would also like the veil of secrecy that has to a large extent shrouded the heart of this issue to be lifted and we meps to be given far more information about the procedures laid down in this agreement than we have so far received .
what is more , all the migrants who arrive on our shores , though they are increasingly fewer in number , say in so many words that they would rather drown on the way here than go back to libya , because of the rapes , torture , abuse , forced repatriations , mass expulsions and racist acts .
the crisis is an enormous test for europe .
i am very pleased that the ukrainian government has managed to stabilise the situation .
core assessments have similarly been made on the strategic reporting exercise , which provides timely evidence of the progress of implementation throughout the whole of europe , offering a basis for high - level debate , peer review , policy learning and an incentive to improve the quality of performance , even if there are certain limitations in these reports .
come on , it should be fun to have an experiment !
if we want to maintain peace in our societies and public support for freedom of movement , we need a strong europe , stronger than it is at present , on the issue of immigration .
in writing . - ( ro ) we are debating today a project which is important to the european union 's future from several perspectives .
the member states must now act to put in place the improved protection which will be provided for those in temporary work .
naturally , bureaucratic formalities should not hinder research .

so , you are the one who has shown - proving mr poignant right - that i am forgetful of how overrated my reputation is .
rapporteur . - ( de ) mr president , with regard to the commissioner 's last point , i would like to request that we refer the matter back to committee in accordance with rule 57 ( 2 ) .
i am pleased that the long awaited vote on the allocation of temporary financial assistance took place today , as this sensitive matter concerning the lithuanian company and its redundant workers was delayed and some of the workers of the company in question lost their jobs as far back as november 2008 .

i believe that the amendments mentioned will ensure the uniformity of the rules for import and will align the rules relating to imports of textiles with those for other industrial goods , which should improve the overall consistency of the legislative environment in this area .
in this sense , the new european union action plan represents a significant step in the strengthening of security and in the delicate process of capacity building where democratic institutions , human rights and socio - economic development within the region are concerned .
while we are dealing with the matters raised in the report , this , too , should be opposed .

in doing so , collectively we helped prevent what people were predicting : the total collapse of the world economy .
i believe that , yesterday , the council put a message across to the commission concerning aid for the banks , and it is clear that we want flexible and quick decision - making regarding the support that can be given to the banks and the financial institutions in the current circumstances .
as i said , we have all done very good work together .
( ro ) as part of this debate , i would like to highlight the deterioration in respect for the religious rights of the romanians living in timoc valley in serbia .

therefore , we must strive towards a breakthrough .
time to move up a gear - creating a europe of entrepreneurship and growth ( vote )
the salami - slicing approach of not telling the people the truth , although you know that you will have to pay in your own interest , is just as damaging to confidence .

in europe , we have freedom of the press .

( applause and heckling )

since the us authorities had put his name on their terror watch lists , the aircraft in which he was flying was not allowed to cross us air space .
i believe this is a good report .
i believe that we should not distance ourselves again from third countries .
in this sense , the commission 's concern about the mechanisms , means and methods involved in recruiting terrorists , particularly those who are recruited in european countries - who are often born and bred here - is understandable .
it aims to do so , for example , by introducing obligations for operators in the distribution chain , by prohibiting those operators situated between the original manufacturer and the final operator in the distribution chain ( generally the pharmacist ) or the end user ( doctor / patient ) from manipulating ( that is removing , modifying or covering ) the safety features on the packaging , and by establishing stricter criteria governing the importation of active pharmaceutical ingredients from third countries and product inspections .

the eu and the governments are trying to obtain grassroots consent , using the carrot and stick method , in order to impose with the least resistance the capitalist restructurings set out in the lisbon strategy : revolving employment and unemployment , an increase in the retirement age and drastic cuts in wages , pensions and social benefits .
we must enable better quality and cheaper housing for everyone , not just for those living in social housing .
member of the commission . - in answer to the specific question you asked : i have not had a meeting with catherine ashton on that issue .
in this respect , there are two different messages being given , making the european union two - faced .
it will also support more intensive work within the framework of other wto agendas , in particular in the areas of services and trips .
it is not about whether or not we want to please representatives of other friendly countries , it is about us checking whether the programmes are really effective , it is about money reaching those it is intended for and not being drained off somewhere .
the decision of the court of human rights seeks to impose from above - so much for subsidiarity - a secular model which many member states cannot identify with or , worse still , seeks to lead us to nihilism : there you have the empty wall which mr borghezio just mentioned .
now , the situation in sudan is making the headlines again .
mr president , commissioner , i shall conclude my maiden speech at this plenary with that appeal for transparency . i am hoping for a positive response from mrs fischer boel .

when we advised the committee on budgetary control to grant discharge for the 2006 financial year , it was not done lightly . quite to the contrary !
it would , therefore , be a mistake to hold back on development aid and on solutions concerning the governance of the country .

the current intention not to extend the use of trammel nets , and to ban them at a depth of between 200 and 600 metres from 1 october 2010 , does not constitute a good example of what has been described .
this assistance would also favour the development of promising initiatives in the energy efficiency sector at the level of local authorities which , due to the recent crisis , have suffered a drastic reduction in revenue .
this measure will lead to a gross violation of personal privacy .
mrs jaakonsaari said that the european union has always developed through a series of crises .
in this context , public and private investment must be increased by developing energy technologies so as to reach the desired goals of a low - carbon economy and also to help overcome the market failures referred to in the climate and energy package .
thank you very much .
in writing . - i have supported this report which is part of the community strategy to reduce co 2 emissions from light - duty vehicles .
nevertheless , we would like the united states to show greater commitment in this field , and we in the european union will try to persuade our american friends of the importance of acting globally and in agreement between the europeans and americans .
the republic of moldova is our neighbour .
it concerns the problem of integrating the roma communities within the european union .
however , i am very concerned that it will not be possible to make appropriate use of the structures which are planned for human rights activities within the external action service .
as the maltese social representatives in the european parliament are against abortion , we have had to vote against these particular parts of the report .
we should obviously use this opportunity to provide a dignified and supportive response to an issue which is , as is the mediterranean , a distinctively european issue .
in reality , it releases the real employer from any obligation towards workers who are considered to be employees of the phantom slave - trading company , which only employs staff on paper .

the report contains a number of particularly important proposals .
stronger action by member states , european clubs and african governments should be taken to ensure that they do not participate in this .
on specific demands , it falls behind them .
( cs ) the european union 's attempt to present kosovo as a unique case is no more than an embarrassing example of wishful thinking .
you should also go quickly before mr berlusconi and mr maroni turn lampedusa into europe 's new alcatraz and continue to keep the citizens there in captivity .
on the contrary , they should aim to create new standards of social cohesion and collectivity which the humanities and a european system of university classification based on them can develop in the right direction .
i am aware , having discussed this with mr böge too , how important this debate is in parliament , and also how important it is for the french presidency .
these are terrible situations caused by the crisis which is devastating us , the consequences of which can be seen in human faces and people 's lives .
in view of the fact that combating climate change affects competitiveness , our resolution calls for all industrial sectors to be made aware of the danger of carbon leakage and for an end to subsidies on fossil fuels , particularly tax exemptions for the aviation industry .
the lack of transparency in the system and the inability of supervisors to piece together an accurate and complete picture of the situation , has led to a dramatic fall in confidence .
what some member states are angling for borders on the criminal at government level in europe .
food scandals occur time and again and not even the new legislation will prevent this , as no european rules are designed to prevent criminal activity ; but these rules will help ensure that , when these scandals do occur , it will be easier to detect what substances have been mixed in .
i am very pleased that parliament and the council share our basic view on this .
we believe we established it a quarter of a century ago .
we therefore need a stronger europe , instead of the suspicions and intergovernmentalism that have recently been the order of the day .
the judgements of the european court of justice are political and deeply reactionary : big business groups impose mediaeval terms of employment to increase their profits .
( ro ) mr. president , i would like to emphasize the importance of this document and , as a member of the eu - mercosur delegation , i would like to emphasize the importance of the region .
here , today , we condemn the extremist parties and their organisation .

i trust that the conclusions we will adopt tomorrow will allow us to establish a solid basis that meets the concerns expressed and enables us to make immediate progress in the launching of industrial initiatives .
finally , the agadir agreement should be extended in order to improve the development of south - south exchanges .
this is the approach which i consider must form the basis of this strategy .
the new directive lays down aspects that are intended to give greater protection to the european consumer , such as the information to be contained in sale contracts , delivery times , the right of withdrawal , and the right to repair or replacement of a defective product , as well as the cases in which the risk is transferred from the vendor to the consumer .
for my part , i would have been pleased to see a greener directive , but this compromise is better than nothing .
we are disappointed that the commission has shelved the review because of difficulties in securing a consensus on the way forward .
now the criticism of the greens and the left is that with these demands , we would interfere in foreign policy and turkey would thus receive special treatment .
we believe that the threshold is set up very carefully .
i would also like to say that it is a myth that this is purely the fault of the council , while the majority of those in parliament , like knights in shining armour , have sacrificed themselves in the interests of the workers .
in the european union , average cereal production is estimated at 276 million tonnes , and if we add to that the stock from the start of the harvest , we have almost 60 million tonnes more than we are expected to use .
both sides are also significant investors in each other 's economy , with a combined volume of foreign direct investment worth eur 200 billion in 2009 .
i have seen with my own eyes that they have done a lot of hard work .
of course , the ukrainians also need to improve , but we are there and are ready to help and assist them , and we will see what this will lead to in the longer term .
even though i do not think the european commission should have more powers than it had previously , i agree that the european currency union must establish a more precise mutual control mechanism for budgetary policy .
iran , in particular , the case of nasrin sotoudeh (
i think this is an unacceptable discrepancy .
amendment of directive 2003/87 / ec so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the community (
we do not have a cooperation and trade agreement on which to hang a democratic clause , we have not managed to send an electoral observation mission , and the funds of the instrument for democracy and human rights are minute .
the baby boom began 60 years ago and the first baby boomers are now reaching retirement age .
on the contrary , i do not want them to suffer more than they already do from the obsolete and dangerous neoliberal system that the imf , the world bank and the european commission are imposing on them .
at the time , the eu decided to extend existing national accounts , and the statistical data to be compiled , to key aspects of sustainable development .
we look forward to close cooperation with the council and the commission in implementing this joint action .
in view of the fact that the rebel forces are carrying out their actions from darfur as well , the council is reminding the sudanese government of its responsibility to prevent armed groups from crossing the border with chad .
well , let 27 flowers - at least - bloom in the european union , but let them bloom separately .
that imperative , which is consistent with the objectives of both the united nations and the european union , chimes exactly with public expectations in europe .
i would like to make two remarks .
for an organization that seeks to erode the differences between nations and peoples , the eu attaches a great deal of importance to linguistic nationalism .
it goes far beyond this . it jeopardises the objectives of the europe 2020 agenda .
we cannot fail to consider the data supplied by interpol reporting that at least 500 000 new original child pornography images are put online each year .
we all remember the recent problems caused by the introduction of unsafe toys into the eu market .

in the face of such sacrifice , we in this house have our own duty to ensure that we do all we can to promote peace and prosperity for afghanistan .
from korea to australia , bulgaria to sweden , film makers head to sarajevo ; co - productions take place .
this is particularly true at eu level , where we are dealing with 27 different countries all trying in this particular context to achieve the lisbon objectives .
we should be clearer about this .
the strategy on fighting trafficking in human beings should also include social dimensions and the dimensions of immigration , asylum and reintegration policies .
on our delegations , i support trying to strengthen what we have in our delegations opening in benghazi , and what we do in iraq .
it would be significant , baroness ashton , if you could tell us something more in this respect .
voting time
i am glad that with mr rasmussen we have a social democrat leader who wants progress and green - social policy and not a return to the 1970s like other social democrats .
fp 7 is another opportunity for the eu to put its research policy on a par with its economic and social ambitions , not least by consolidating the european research area .
i must point out that we regarded the work carried out by the secretary - general of the council of europe as particularly important and we took due note of the reports produced by mr marty .
i would therefore like to appeal to the commission to take competitiveness principles into account , to a greater extent than before , when implementing the necessary reforms in the sugar industry , and to pay much more attention to the development of the biofuels sector .
the europe 2020 strategy is the eu 's response to such challenges .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( cs ) i first of all wish to thank my fellow member , mrs panayotopoulos - cassiotou , for her good report and pleasant cooperation .
firstly , the daily transmission of catch data is required under the regulation on electronic logbooks .
i would like to point out that , up until now - as many of my fellow members have already said - every member state was free to decide whether or not to impose a time restriction on length of stay .
the latest developments and the initiatives taken by the commission on the specific issues of the environment - health relationship are very significant ; they show that alongside the cooperation developing on a mid - to long - term basis between the environment , health and research sectors , it is possible to take immediate measures to further incorporate the health dimension into environment policy , with benefits to both the environment and health .
undoubtedly , the attempt to impose han chinese majority culture on tiny minorities in the world 's most populous country is causing much tension and resentment .
we shall reject any amendments that run counter to them .
i now put it to the vote .
first of all i would like to remind you that the commission 's communication is the result of intensive dialogue between all the stakeholders and careful consultation with leading specialists in this field .
i firmly believe that we have to protect the car industry with a european solution , rather than national ones .
i would therefore like to thank commissioner vassiliou and the rapporteur , mrs paliadeli , for their initiative and their hard work , and i would like to take this opportunity to say that , although initially , it was an initiative by the member states , we now need to give it a clearly eu dimension .
in the past , airbus has shown that eu industry , given the right strategy , can compete successfully in the toughest markets with top technology .
i would like to underline the very constructive cooperation we have enjoyed with the court .
it then became very complicated as we found ourselves negotiating whole new delegated acts without precedents for future acts , so congratulations to her and to the council and commission .
in so doing , i am coming out very clearly against the increase in the secretarial allowance and any increase in the number of officials here in the european parliament .
in this case , that means protection of lives , of individuals , and protection of safety and security to improve on the current situation .
the community customs code ( ccc ) was established by regulation ( eec ) no 2913/92 .
in close consultation with this parliament , josé manuel barroso was appointed president of the european commission for a second term .
since the european union has many oil platforms - there are more than 500 in the north sea - everything must be done , at european level , to avoid such a catastrophe in our territory .
the new member states would have been forced to adopt the policy as part of the acquis communautaire and hence would have been compelled to start as new member states under unreasonable conditions .
i am appealing to the commission to assist in a pragmatic and urgent manner .
the situation , in my opinion , undermines the reputation of the government and also of mr saakashvili , who rose to power with peaceful protests in 2003 , and that cast him as the most democratic leader in the caucasus .
it is a self - centred opinion for those other member states , looking after themselves .
firstly , because turkey is not geographically located within europe ; secondly , because turkey is becoming more and more islamic and ankara is actually a leading member of the largest international pan - islamic organisation , the oic ; thirdly , because religious minorities are persecuted and their inferiority is ingrained in society ; fourthly , because turkey continues to officially deny the genocide of one and a half million armenian christians and occupies cyprus in both military and political terms in breach of international law .
the matter concerns implementation of directive 2002/49 / ec relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise .
that also leads me to repeat the very sensible remark by mr rack that we need to be careful , because the industry must be made fully aware of the targets and the future framework in order to adapt .
trafficking of people , be it women , men or children , is a criminal offence and on the increase in all member states .
they exchange information and provide each other with specific training to improve their respective staff knowledge on issues of mutual interest .
setting up a cooperation arrangement along these lines is the aim that has given rise to this initiative .
the report that we are debating and adopting today concerns a ceiling for the eu budget .
once again , the summit dealt with the point that parent banks are responsible for their subsidiaries , as my colleague adrian severin has also emphasised , and a very important step forward has also been taken with regard to energy security .
( nl ) the complex and dangerous situation in somalia and its impact on stability in the region is a source of great concern to all of us .
but it did so with some exceptions which present quite a challenge - let me come back to that in a moment .
at the heart of this is the commission , and no other institution , and , i might add , for the following key reason : the commission is the institution that is tied to parliament in this regard , and parliamentary authorisation for action taken in matters of sovereignty - and monetary issues are key matters of sovereignty - is essential .
eu policy framework to fight violence against women ( debate )
they are a reminder , if such were needed , that destruction is always possible , that the human condition is a permanent struggle for peace , and that nothing we acquire is permanent .
with all due respect for fellow members from member states which are afflicted by the madness of terrorism , i have to say that our duty to ensure that democracy is never defended by undemocratic means is paramount .
therefore , it is difficult not to agree with the rapporteur that it is the member states which are responsible for correctly implementing the directive and establishing effective control procedures for the storage and processing of waste equipment .
saying no to dictatorship does not automatically guarantee the rule of law and democracy .
it represents a significant step away from dependency for bosnia and herzegovina .
the group of the greens / european free alliance has tabled four amendments which , mr president , we cannot support , because they mix concepts of illegal fishing with the content of this regulation , whose operation in practice has shown that the control filters established by customs in las palmas have worked correctly .
in 2100 , we will make up 3 % of that population .
people have to be told where this bacterium is .
i am convinced that it is our responsibility to put the spotlight on the anonymous hoards of women involved in our society , without whom the world could not move forward .
he soon mobilised 12 million people to protest on the streets all over the world calling for an end to farc 's violence .
the proposal to reduce emissions by 25 % to 40 % by 2020 compared with 1990 , or even by 50 % by 2050 , seems to me like random numbers without any real knowledge of the extent to which the emissions can be reduced .
european socialists have long since been calling for a reform of financial markets and for coordinated action by european union governments .
the only logical and defensible approach is for shipping to also contribute .
purchases at trade fairs are now also classed as direct selling .
therefore , there must be possibilities for the consumer to have extra safeguards around the setting up of direct debits .
( pl ) mr president , in its sixth term , the european commission adopted a series of legislative proposals as part of the fight against tax fraud and tax avoidance in the european union .
that is why we must ensure that state subsidies are always there only in exceptional cases , where nothing else can be done , or when we can channel them in a way that supports the common good without distorting competition .
perhaps our children are more proficient in using the new technologies .
i would like to mention something of which i have personal knowledge .
thus , i consider that future legislation should provide for the huge disproportion between the younger population aged 35 , active in the agricultural sector ( only 8,5 % of the total number of farmers in europe ) and the other age categories in this field .
having strongly supported the positions of the german social democrats in your speech just now and thus distanced yourself from chancellor merkel , i propose that you proceed as follows . if you feel so comfortable within the european social democratic fold , come first to german social democracy and we shall take you gradually closer to french social democracy and , by the end , you will be a really good comrade .
thousands of people who have been imprisoned without trial , tortured and exposed to death threats , who have been driven from their homes , displaced or subjected to sexual violence are familiar with the name of salih mahmoud osman .
i wish to draw attention to the high school dropout rate .
often people think of aviation as a single industry but , when one examines issues like airport charging , it soon becomes apparent that the airport and airline sectors have different views and aspirations .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , this week 's council takes place somewhere along the road between despair and hope .
smes are particularly susceptible to such contemporary phenomena unless these are curbed by means of countermeasures , information , supervision and training .
i say this because if we fail to be credible on our immigration policy , we cannot expect our citizens to trust us to open up our markets to legal migration .
the problem is that the council 's current role is transferred to the commission and that the scope for cooperation is severely reduced .
energy efficiency mostly concerns buildings because there is a huge potential in energy efficiency in buildings .
eurobarometer surveys show that 70 % to 80 % of eu citizens believe we need a common security and defence policy .
this own - initiative report rightly recognises the crucial role of consumer organisations , which are the ideal organisations for alerting public authorities to the problems consumers experience in their daily lives .
this strategy has never been so crucial , precisely in this period of economic slowdown , and the structural reforms have to be able to take their course .
the western balkans and serbia are more than just a region of strategic interest to the european union , and not only do the citizens in this region need us , but we all need them .
( applause )
a colleague of mine has described it thus : this report has a whiff of the cold war about it .
consequently it would be pointless as far as equality is concerned to sacrifice another quarter of a century in the name of higher summits .
i just said that we should involve our citizens so that they can do something in their own houses .
that is why the destruction of opium poppy plantations without offering alternative means of earning a living is not an effective solution .
you regret having obtained the agreement of brussels for a drop in oil taxation , but that is simply a consequence of the treaties of nice and amsterdam , which you ratified through the parliamentary route .
against this backdrop , harmonisation of the law on consumer credit has its limits and should be done cautiously and gradually .
the constant calls since it was founded for wages to be cut and capitalist restructurings to be speeded up found fertile soil in the capitalist crisis .
i would like to give a brief overview of the committee on industry , research and energy 's report on a commission communication on ccs demonstration facilities .
russia and ukraine have expressed concerns regarding the issue of visas to drivers , including coach drivers , and to couriers .
when the house votes in a moment , mr president , i will take the opportunity to congratulate all the political groups for the support that they have given to this matter , as well as the taiwanese people , the taiwanese authorities , and their extremely strong diplomatic team .
i did so at the beginning , in the presence of prime minister topolánek .
this is about legislation at european level .
the central idea is therefore to reinforce the consumer 's position in any negotiations to purchase rights of use .
one solution could be to oblige initiators to maintain an internet site containing financial information , such as sources of income , expenses and financial reports .
however , i want to make it clear that i oppose the ongoing liberalisation of railways in the european union , which is responsible for the fragmentation , lack of investment and ineffectiveness of rail freight today .
firstly , i would like to thank you and the european citizens who have expressed their sympathy in relation with the disaster in hungary .
( the president cut off the speaker )
i find it very difficult to agree to amendment 2 .
the following have forfeited their entitlement to the subsistence allowance : jim allister for 3 days , godfrey blum for 2 days , sylwester chruszcz for 2 days , paul marie coûteaux for 5 days , maciej marian giertych for 3 days , roger helmer for 3 days , roger knapman for 3 days , hans - peter martin for 3 days and philippe de villiers for 3 days .
it is a serious problem , but it is a problem that can be resolved .
this is currently a concern which i completely understand , but some members also have prejudices .
in the international arena and on the european political scene , we cannot simply transfer the national model of separation of powers and checks and balances .
the commission proposal aims at the introduction of a unilateral and temporary suspension of import duties on 75 export items from pakistan .
while we admire the chinese culture and make progress in exchanging goods and investments , it is our duty to speak loudly and clearly and condemn the killings and executions .
because mr corbett does not think they should be allowed to !
as always , the question arises of whose security is being defended .
i must say that i am very happy that the majority supports smoking bans and all the other measures that promote smoking prevention .
that is why we have raised this question with the national regulators , and we are monitoring this problem with the european regulators group .
this is also one of the reasons why i voted for this report and i would like to add the need to give increased attention to ports , since 6 out of the 7 ultra peripheral regions are islands .
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , a short while ago , i gave a speech about my work in the european parliament , about my tasks here and about my many appointments .
( ro ) madam president , please allow me to thank commissioner frattini for his answer .
i have the impression , however , that an attempt is being made to latch on to this established movement in order to impose discrimination against the family founded on marriage between a man and a woman and against religious freedom , especially as concerns religious schools .
by saying that it is in cyprus not for the benefit of the turkish cypriots , but for turkey 's strategic interests .
the sitting is suspended .
i should also like to thank your group chairmen , lutz goepel , luis manuel capoulas santos , niels busk , friedrich - wilhelm graefe zu baringdorf , vincenzo aita and sergio berlato .
in the case of acta , a handful of countries have negotiated among themselves the rules that are to prevail in the area of intellectual property rights .
eu industry depends totally on ree imports from china , which holds a monopoly over 97 % of world production and has 36 % of global economic reserves .
we are against measures which impose obligations on small shops to collect , without limitation , small appliances without the consumer being required to purchase a new , similar appliance in return .
also , habits in alcohol consumption vary widely in different parts of europe .
i believe that fears that extending maternity leave on full pay from 14 to 20 weeks will penalise women are unfounded : it is our specific duty to protect the weakest workers , allowing them the right to stay at home with their children .
we must remember that this is a completely new situation for the people of the far north , and also for the fauna and flora .
the debate will take place on wednesday afternoon in the presence of the chairman of the council of foreign ministers , czech foreign minister schwarzenberg .
the priorities should be energy content , eco - efficiency and low - emission technology and its development .
the vote will take place on thursday at 11.00 .
of course , we talk a great deal , we talk about economic governance , we also talk about monetary governance , but we could make matters a great deal simpler and certainly more effective if we devised and implemented real budgetary coordination of the euro area members .
only the rich can choose alternative services in other countries , and in so doing they undermine the public health care system that is the safety net of the poor .
we have hitherto been concentrating far too much on promoting cultural diversity via the muslim immigrant population without ensuring that our own culture , in turn , is recognised in the countries of the islamic world .
clearly , today , we are failing on that score .
during that discussion , it was particularly mr lehne , who was shadow rapporteur for this report , who suggested that member states should already be given the option of excluding micro - entities , the really small companies , from this european legislation at this stage .
some steps forward have been made in the last few years at european level , especially through a 2009 directive , but there is still much to do , especially to guarantee full civil rights to sufferers from this condition in the world of work and of mobility , and in guaranteeing the availability of medication during school hours .
the formation of this group is causing anxiety and fear in neighbouring countries , primarily slovakia , romania and serbia .
they are still allowing youth unemployment , which is reaching rates double those of overall unemployment and which affects many young people with higher education who cannot find work , and even less so work that has anything to do with their education .
however , this is essentially an intergovernmental organism whose decisions , which affect us all , have to be implemented nationally .
north korea (
here culture clearly draws the shorter straw and is in a weaker position than european internal market law .
in addition , we are still waiting for specific tasks and objectives to be defined for the eeas staff .
since this is a disease where the medication costs are very high and cannot be met by the majority of patients , increased funding for these drugs is desirable .
for us , galileo is one of the most important , if not the most important , industrial policy projects and we must ensure that it runs smoothly .
- ( nl ) mr president , the longer we go on the more the european mandarins behave like a breed of political autistics , completely closed off from the real world , from the citizens , whom they nevertheless still claim to serve .
i will mention several figures which will fully demonstrate the absurdity of this assumption .
we really need to be realistic in our assessment of the situation , for even if we succeed in convincing the americans to join in the emissions trading system we shall still be faced with a list of other countries around the world and i personally am not sure how we are ever going to start talking to them .
mr president , first , could i repeat in public my own congratulations to commissioner füle .
the primary reason why they are not more widespread is that these systems are expensive , and the appropriate information and intelligent infrastructure are lacking .
we are debating the persecution of christians around the world , but while we are talking about the violence that has taken place in iraq , egypt , the philippines , india and elsewhere , we continue to ignore what has happened closer to home .
we also reject the proposal on co 2 duties .
only then will we have sensible prices .
question time ( commission )
it needs to take on more employees specialised in development .
epas may not be perfect but many of my friends and family in poorer countries are fed up at the lack of access to goods and services and at being forced to rely on state - run monopolies or companies with links to corrupt politicians .
now the farmers ' unions are beginning to foresee benefits to animal health and welfare through the use of cloning .
we were therefore obliged to include specific articles to cover the illegal use , trade and acquisition of firearms . this compromise takes account of these requirements .
however , they do not use it for micro - credits .
resumption of the session
there is , however , work to be done ; we have european neighbours that have not fully abolished this practice and it should remain our focus to continue our efforts toward complete abolition .
criminals tend to evade controls , of course , and we must have the technological instruments to prevent that from happening , such as the use of biometrics , showing full respect for everyone 's freedom but in order - as it were - to ward off temptation .
i said this before and i want to hear it again clearly .
approval of minutes of previous sitting : see minutes
we have therefore proposed and agreed to this measure as a temporary measure until we have framework directives that establish clear rules .
we must do more to raise its profile .
today , we have strengthened women 's rights , but also those of men , with this paternity leave .
even the simplest of fishermen would be able to tell you that the tide comes in and the tide goes out .
it is work for those in the pipeline industry .
in any case , the ambitious goal of getting the economic crisis under control could not be achieved .
mr president , it was in this very house , almost seven years ago , at the end of the constitutional convention , when we members of the european parliament and members of the national parliaments succeeded in putting forward a proposal that was accepted by the presidium .
commissioner kroes , i would also ask that , at all events , this investigation start quickly - i agree wholeheartedly with mr langen on this - and that the information not originate solely from the acquiring party , as a dossier submitted by magna to the commission is likely to demonstrate what magna wants it to demonstrate .
this leads to your fourth question on the transparency principle and the principle of good administration .
our guiding principle in evaluating the amendments was always the conviction that changes to the current system of coordination should in no event lead to a reduction of citizens ' rights .
i think that this is highly inconsistent with the general spirit of the lisbon strategy .
i know that this is one area where there is not consensus in europe at this stage .
they will probably now have to be reintegrated in the southern economy .
there is no direct link to our interinstitutional cooperation .
what i would therefore like to know is are you willing to stay all new authorisations and all renewals of authorisations , such as that of mon 810 , until the new efsa rules have come into force ?
we need this capital to fill up the cap.
( sk ) i should first of all like to thank the rapporteur , timothy kirkhope , for including provisions on display in the regulation on a code of conduct for computerised reservation systems ( crs ) .
if pedestrians are to be made visible by means of rfid clothing , it will be possible to monitor people 's every step .
obscure privatisations and corruption , the lack of freedom of the press in parts of the country , the intimidation of ngos : all this is making people lose heart and turn their back on the country .
this has been emphasised in the house on various occasions .
we agreed on emission reductions for international transport and , despite resistance from some corners , we put figures on the global financial need in developing countries to fight climate change .
just as was the harbouring by ireland of three ira terrorists convicted in colombia .
i should therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and call on the european commission to implement the proposals in the bendtsen report , thereby helping our economies out of the crisis at the same time .
europe is obliged to innovate if it is to survive globalisation .
the most essential thing to achieving that is for parties to have legal status , and that is what this report is proposing : parties that have a territorial presence and that , at the same time , conduct themselves according to democratic rules ; and a differentiation between recognition of the parties and financing , which requires popular support .
without clear and careful coordination and clear rules at a european union or euro zone level , it will be difficult to manage these very challenging processes .
it is , however , true that there were shortcomings in the supervision mechanisms , which , we should remember , are essentially national systems .
to this end , it will be essential to create not only a programme , but also a special fund for the resettlement of refugees in the union .
the debate is closed .
we received over 700 such papers from national governments , from european - level associations , from businesses , from universities , and from regional and local organisations .
the number of errors has fallen , but we have still not reached the ' tolerable error level ' .
surely , there is great enthusiasm to introduce a new tax on financial transactions .
it should also be a warning to the naive people who think iran can be handled with kid gloves .
we are threatened by a diminution in the working - age population , a fall in economic competitiveness and a decrease in funding for social care and keeping pension systems in equilibrium .
if we do not get this treaty , we will have a europe with fewer social rights .
member states have developed their own safety standards , primarily for national routes , based on national technical and operational concepts .
we do not want this !
i firmly believe these partnerships will only succeed if they are anchored in an enduring partnership based on trust and mutual respect .
it is unfortunate that the partnership principle is not always adhered to in the spending of structural funds .
i believe that the role of the state in this is a limited one - it should not seek to abrogate the rights and duties of parents , of the churches and of schools .
( 12475/2004 - 11803/2004 - c 6-0118/2005 - .
following this , the scale of charges and common time periods for examining applications in the different countries should be harmonised , and the authorisation process should be simplified in the case of formulations with minimal differences or variations in colour , for example , thus avoiding extra specific tests requiring further evaluation by each member state .
concerning support to apiaries in difficulty , i would like to tell you that the commission is glad to see that the number of hives increased between 2004 and 2007 - and this not counting enlargement .
but the sourcing of raw materials in processed food is irreversibly complex , as ingredients are chosen based on price , quality and availability and countries of origin in a single meat processing plant may alter day by day , and even hour by hour .
( interruption from another member )
the way forward for a democratic europe is not putrid compromises , paltry promises and immoral threats .
however , many member states also have independent supervisors who apply and elaborate legislation .
people in this age group bring added value to the world of work , and therefore preparatory measures should be taken to involve them more .
( the president cut off the speaker )
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , food and hygiene go together ; there is absolutely no doubt about that .
that is my main point of criticism and it prompted me not to vote for the report .
it would be nice if this example in this chamber could be followed by many further examples .
i am , of course , delighted on behalf of our group to welcome the fact that taiwanese citizens will soon be able to enter the schengen zone without needing a visa - also known in eu jargon terms as a visa liberalisation for taiwan .
( pl ) mr president , there are several aspects that we must consider while discussing the european union 's common foreign policy today .
on behalf of the ecr group . - madam president , my group supports the publication of this green paper .
their average emissions reduction between 2009 and 2015 would have been 23 % , compared with just 10 % for their korean counterparts , which account for 95 % of total car sales in korea .
this is the position that we need to strengthen and help to consolidate .
the exchange programme for entrepreneurs is a good approach in this connection .
on behalf of the pse group . - madam president , let me first make two preliminary remarks .
on the basis of applications for assistance by poland , slovakia , hungary , the czech republic , romania and candidate country croatia relating to the flooding disasters of may , june and july 2010 , it proposes the application of the eu solidarity fund .
it needs and deserves democracy .
with a higher percentage of protein crops in crop rotation , soil fertility and structure , nutrient storage and the health of the crops which follow is improved .
we are part of a community of peoples who guarantee the rights of citizens , strive for peace and prosperity and want to live in peace .
several of my colleagues in the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and in other groups also voted against the own - initiative report - each having his or her own reasons .
as mr kalinowski said , agricultural products which are produced in line with other standards are imported to eu markets , while european farmers incur huge costs associated with animal welfare or environmental protection .
recently the eu voted against an amendment placed before the committee on budgets that sought to divert eu funding that goes into institutions towards community - and family - based services .
that said , we do need to know what financial obligations we are taking on in the longer term .
it will be clear to anybody listening to this debate just what differences there were between the groups and what a difficult process this has sometimes been .
in great european cities , there are already parking facilities that provide tourists with bicycles , free of charge , during the entire period of stay of the vehicles .
will georgia or ukraine join nato when its reforms have been carried out ?
i prefer to see it grown here rather than imported from elsewhere .
they do not dare to complain about the fact that they are treated badly or about violence or sexual exploitation .
the first situation , relating to social welfare , is where a worker is unable to earn enough to lead a dignified life due to physical or mental disabilities , or other related reasons .
this is the first thing .
second , reducing protectionist tendencies .
furthermore , it adds new points to what parliament has already said in the past , such as asking the high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy and vice - president of the commission to assess the results of the investigations by all parties and report back to parliament , recalls that the responsibility and credibility of the eu and its member states require full monitoring of the investigations and shows concern about pressure put on ngos involved in the drawing up of the goldstone report and in the follow - up investigations , including reference to the restrictive measures imposed on their activities .
however , it seems that it can offer , if not solutions , at least interesting food for thought : it appears obvious to me that training and education should be at the heart of the political priorities of today and of tomorrow .
its renewal therefore confirms this success and we hope that it will continue to do so in the future .
we still need an evaluation .
afghanistan cannot do without reliable administration .
there is indeed , as earlier speakers have said , considerable overlap between their programmes , and i believe that their management and administration , at least , could usefully be merged .
secondly , on the politics of it , this was the first real vote on climate change .
madam president , i support this report because it addresses the issue of diversity and our agricultural policy between the regions .
in today 's global context , innovation policy has a huge impact on all areas of life and , in future , it will become the main pillar of economic , cultural and social development in the european union .
as mrs gebhardt said , rome iii really has at its heart the intention of protecting the weaker spouse at the point when marriage contracts are being concluded .
- before the vote :
i think it is a positive development that we are going to have the courage to channel it through the afghan government 's budget in future .
i would ask the president , in that letter , to remind those teams that there is a fine tradition of sportspeople withdrawing from events on human rights grounds - from muhammad ali and vietnam to cricketers refusing to go to south africa under apartheid and athletes to the moscow olympics .
an eu - inspired crisis will shortly hit the uk egg industry .
( pl ) mr president , european and third - country consumers receive too little information about the quality and standards of european food .
although the economic and financial crisis has had a significant impact on the level of unemployment of both sexes , this crisis has affected women worst .
madam president , that is the end of my speech on the subject we are dealing with at the moment and , like you , i would like to dedicate a few minutes , which are my last , to saying some words of farewell .
we are not having a debate now .
if , last week , that authority was weakened by the way in which the most senior leaders of the european union were elected , it is regained by debates just such as this one today .
i should therefore like to take a few moments to inform you of the position prevailing in the council on the main issues which are addressed by the three rapporteurs , mrs trautmann , mrs del castillo and mr harbour .
in writing . - ( pl ) i voted in favour of the report by mr reul on conventional energy sources and energy technology .
a just peace , which is only possible by respecting the inalienable right of the palestinian people to an independent and sovereign state , with the 1967 borders and its capital in east jerusalem !
in writing . - ( sv ) the european parliament 's amendments improve the legislation , but at the same time i do not want to vote for its implementation .
i must also say that i agree with mr kirkhope 's assessment of the importance of distinguishing between asylum and the immigration of workers .
when we asked you , in the committee on legal affairs , why you had not presented proposals such as those as outlined in the lévai report in parliament , you said that the market would move in this direction anyway and you therefore saw no need for any change here .
latvia notes with pleasure the european commission 's proposals in this regard .
i myself make an effort every few months to alert stakeholders to the various consultation processes that are ongoing and i genuinely believe and would ask you , commissioner , if you do not agree that it would be very useful for the commission offices in each country to draw up a list , a very wide - ranging list , of all stakeholders and ensure that they are alerted to the consultation process , so that they would know and could take part .
mr amato chooses to be absent from meetings on the subject .
evidence of this is the registration of the ' for freedom ' movement , allowing opposition papers to be printed and distributed , and the country 's openness to the eastern partnership initiative .
we believe that these funds will end up in the pockets of the multinational companies in control of the development programmes .
in writing . - the proposal for a directive on the european protection order , submitted by 12 member states , is an initiative aimed at preventing crime .
european network and information security agency (
it is a very sensitive stage of their life and we have to do our utmost to provide some form of security and protection for their own good .
is it possible to adapt the water framework directive so that in the future , storage power plants can also be given an opportunity to ensure there is a balance between solar energy and , on the other hand , wind energy ?
no , we will leave it to our irish colleagues to analyse the reasons for such an outcome and also to propose their vision of a possible way out .
i have a comment and a question to mr cohn - bendit , lest you think that irish ears are not listening to you .
what we do not consider to be correct and what bothers us is the hidden agenda promoted here by some member states and partly by the commission and some groups of meps as well .
it is even sadder that some political forces are treating these events as interference in italy 's domestic affairs and are trying to make political capital out of the gypsy issue .
we shall not be making concessions on those positions .
this procedure will ensure a standard approach to all applications , thereby eliminating the risk of any ' gateways ' to the schengen area appearing .
meanwhile , mr barroso , the summit did not even place it on its agenda .
you will see that it contains significant and detailed legally binding commitments on the way that the us treasury department can process data under the agreement .
the report by helmut scholz , on behalf of the committee on international trade , on the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council amending regulation ( ec ) no 1934/2006 establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories - c 7-0101/2009 - and
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on 9 may , the eu , at the behest of the ministers for the economy and finance , gave a firm response to the financial markets .
( es ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i think the rapporteur , mrs meissner , must be congratulated .
i am confident that the proposed changes will have a positive impact on limiting financial irregularities .
the next eu - russia summit is another opportunity to continue these discussions .
i refuse to believe , therefore , that we are dealing with a kind of industrial dinosaur that is doomed to extinction in the very near future .
member of the commission . - ( ro ) i can only repeat what i have just said , namely that , by the actions taken by the european commission to support language diversity , not only the 23 official languages are supported , but also the other languages spoken in the european union , including the regional languages , the less widespread languages .
the commission is now finalising the new and thorough assessment of each of these requests . it expects to inform ireland of its results in july of this year .
i repeat that , in the opinion of the presidency at the moment , the time for such debates has not yet come , but we have to appreciate the fact that , out of a possible 27 ratifications , only five have so far been secured .
now , with regard to the upcoming summit , i would like to highlight four issues .
we have to look at the entire supply chain and the entire car market which , of course , also includes the vehicle trade and vehicle repair shops .
the random use of antibiotics in agriculture is - or has been - common to all farming , be it large or small .
i would like to invite the committee of the regions to study this area and begin a broad consultation in the rural regions to learn more about life there with all its advantages and disadvantages .
in writing . - ( de ) the erasmus mundus ii programme is similar to the erasmus exchange programme for european students , but is aimed primarily at exchanges with third countries .
he was the beneficiary of an error of mine .
i sincerely admire the idealism of the rapporteur , tadeusz zwiefka .
however , internet commerce also gives rise to questions , especially about the sale of counterfeit products which are protected by intellectual property rights .
we can only make progress here if parliament receives the information it has asked for - proper information , not fragments .
however , there are six points in particular in the report that i would like to highlight here this evening :
you must realise that all of the negotiations today in luxembourg and next week in brussels are being followed throughout the world .
i really think that we should take a stand on this and consider whether we should not have tightened up the rules .
mr president , mr matsakis opened the debate wondering if there was one country responsible for encouraging the whole of the eu to ban the pmoi .
that is how i understand paragraph 4 .
without galileo , we will not have sesar , and without sesar , we will not achieve single european sky 2 .
we have seen what agreements are worth after a coup in the case of the readmission agreements .
it would be unfair and even immoral to change the rules at this stage in the game .
mr president , the future of the common agricultural policy will see increased focus on connecting it with climate change policy .
it is five years since enlargement . it is now time to review things once again .
the fact that we are in an economic crisis does not make our problems of dependency disappear .
in the commission 's view , the detention of mr hu jia places an obligation on the eu to act in a firm manner because of the clear inference that he was arrested as a consequence of speaking freely and honestly about the repression of human rights defenders via a telephone link to a meeting of the european parliament 's subcommittee on human rights in november 2007 .
on the west bank at the moment , there has been no improvement with the borders , or with freedom of movement .
there are a number of disparities , then , between the member states , whether in terms of the grounds for accelerated procedures , or in terms of access to personal interviews or to effective remedy .
there is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues it raises .
we believe it is important to have sensible regulations for products on the financial markets considering what happened , including in your country .
this , too , is human trafficking , and we must not be silent about it .
we should not see a repeat of the situation when the commission did not want to provide the parliament with information that was vital for its decision - making .
we are pleased about the reduction in the duration of proceedings but , on the other hand , we have observed a persistent backlog of cases .
the commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union in respect of strategy papers , as those strategy papers supplement regulation ( ec ) no 1889/2006 and are of general application .
are you aware that the european union will never implement this 2020 strategy if we do not pool investments for the future , if , when you assess the public expenditure of member states , the only expenditure that you treat differently , where you take quality into account , is when member states introduce capital - funded pension reforms , whereas you ignore those who are inclined to make efforts with regard to education ?
that was how it sounded .
again , it is due to this lack of political will that , by the end of the year , the eu still had not received a waste sorting plan .
the agreement will not only make the canadian and european markets more competitive , it will also make them safer as regulators and enforcement authorities are moving closer to cooperation in all matters of certification , inspections and enforcement , to ensure the highest level of safety for passengers and cargo flights .
education is the only way to prevent hiv and aids , and i am pleased that the commission subscribes to that view .
this message must say that ' no one should think that , having got over the worst part of this crisis , those former practices which led to the crisis can be allowed to redevelop , as if nothing had happened ' .

they do not have the infrastructure that is required for a modern ' state - to - be ' .
mr president , i congratulate you on the decision you have just taken regarding quorums in the european parliament .
the candidacy of the state president in parliamentary elections is an unknown precedent in the history of a democratic state , just like the nomination of the head of the radical movement ' nashi ' for the post of minister for youth affairs and the refusal to receive a delegation from the european parliament 's subcommittee on human rights .
it is supposed to bring improvements in administration , flexibility , security and data storage capacities , as well as providing other new functionalities .
as in the case of road transport , we should seek more intelligent solutions .
the european legislation represents the framework for safety and environmental protection measures , both in general and in the event of a specific accident .
to conclude , i would like to congratulate commissioner dalli and the rapporteurs for the good work carried out on this sensitive topic .

the main thing , of course , is that we should be able to export our products to those countries .
ladies and gentlemen , we need a transport system that is competitive , sustainable and environmentally friendly and does not rule out road transport , because at the moment , it is the only way to get everywhere .
i voted for the report on a new strategy for afghanistan .
this was always the commission 's intention .
we would call on the council and the commission to keep us informed of their negotiations .
i also merely wanted to clarify that paragraph 54 , which deals with public services , services of general interest , is problematic , and we therefore voted against part of this paragraph , which continues to call , ideologically but in veiled terms , for further liberalisation .
the stockholm programme adopted by the european council on 10 and 11 december 2009 expressed the view that labour immigration may increase competitiveness and economic vitality .
( applause )
( pl ) mr president , commissioner , the mobile telephone and the internet have become symbols of mobility and innovation .
as previous speakers have said , this parliament has a duty to bring down to earth the commission 's very generous and very altruistic proposals .
that is the only way to get the kremlin to listen .
it is something that i , along with many others , work for on a daily basis in the committee on development .
i voted against the report , as it was ill - timed , in spite of the amendments .
coming from lithuania , i am very well aware that member states alone are unable to achieve significant progress in terms of economic development , environmental protection , sustainable transport and tourism , energy and many other areas .
yet verbal inflation , the inflation of grandiose and illusory objectives is just as pernicious as monetary inflation .
first , all or most of us can come to this house and deplore and denounce terrorism , as well we might , because it is vile and indefensible in all its forms .
it simply defines a person who has entered the territory of the union illegally as an illegal immigrant who has rights .
the council is not therefore competent to give an opinion on this issue .
particularly alarming are the death sentences being handed down to political dissidents .
in writing . - ( lt ) an agreement on civil aviation safety between the european community and canada has undoubted benefits for both parties .
( the sitting closed at 18:20 )
to improve governance , we are counting heavily on the european commission 's proposals .
i am taking account of this new regulation , which was proposed by the previous commission , under mr barroso 's authority , and which improves matters .
our committee was right , but we must go further .
immigration , selective or otherwise , distorts the identity and culture of the people of europe and aggravates community divisions and the tensions that derive from them , in the image of what is happening in every multi - ethnic and multicultural society in the world .
madam president , the internal market is not an end in itself .
so , ...
economically , the plan is quite unsound and , most important of all , it is politically unacceptable to the taxpayers in france , britain and germany that we should do so .
i fully agree that this problem deserves more complete research and that , before presenting draft legislation , we must study carefully various non - regulatory methods for dealing with some of the issues raised in the report , in other words : improved cooperation and coordination among national authorities , inspection and other national enforcement authorities ; an awareness of good practice within companies ; current guidelines and standards ; initiatives on social responsibility ; and transnational company agreements , into which are already built innovative provisions relating to risk assessment procedures and the supervision of subcontractors .
i would have liked us to have had a position that we all agreed on in order to be better placed to enter into negotiations with the council .
first of all , the start of negotiations for a free trade area with the eu is strictly linked to ukraine 's membership of the wto .

campania could make a huge leap overnight towards becoming a recycling community .
the hague convention is the benchmark framework to be implemented uniformly in all countries of the european union , and romania needs to make an effort to adjust to it .

some data should give us pause to reflect whether we are on the right road in our work , even though excellent work has been done over this year and a half .
we now know what he wanted it for .
let me take this opportunity to remind you of what we are already doing in and with iraq and what we can set out to do under still difficult circumstances in the future .
we must strive to ensure that cross - border healthcare services or ' medical tourism ' ( as the rapporteur observes in this case ) do not weaken our national healthcare systems .
mr president , mrs schaldemose has just highlighted the quality of this debate , particularly on the specific point of the consumer agency which , unless i am mistaken , already exists in canada , and mr dalli will tell us how things stand today .
the relationships that have developed between the audiovisual industries of the eu member states and those of third countries must continue and must be strengthened in the interest not only of professionals but also of consumers .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 16 january 2008 , at 12 noon .
bearing in mind the previous distribution of licences and ( non - ) respect for the principle of relative stability in the light of the increase in fishing opportunities , this new agreement therefore involves a marked imbalance : portugal only gains two more licences , while the other member states gain a further 16 ( france ) and 13 ( spain ) .
europe has to face up to its responsibilities and take on the scourge of the mafia gangs that are trading in human misery .
some 25 million people in the european union are unemployed .
by this i mean that some try to see this excellent project - whose purpose is to raise europe 's profile and show that europe 's strength lies in its diversity , in the fact that it is united in its diversity - as a threat to the notion of the nation state , or a threat to european identity , or to something else .

instead , there is a desire to exert pressure in public , in every way possible , in order to influence public opinion .
the chinese government quite properly deployed police and military personnel to quell the violence and stop the retaliatory attacks by the han population on the uighurs .
finally , may i say a few words about cuba .
this report is on the annual report from the council to the european parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy ( cfsp ) in 2009 , presented to the european parliament in application of part ii , section g , paragraph 43 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 may 2006 .

an amendment in my name and that of mr deva and ms belohorská calls on the commission to ask all of the union 's partners around the world , both governments and ngos , to undertake a permanent gender analysis of all abortions and to regularly report the findings to parliament .
i see many friends of smes here .
based on the menrad report , adopted in this house six years ago , on the jurisprudence and on the experiences of management and labour in the last 12 years , the pse group has always asked for an ambitious revision of the directive .
radio liberty and radio free europe were also previously based in munich .
we question this because there has been no clear position on the issue of derivatives , when we know that these products caused major public institutions and authorities in italy and europe to run up massive debts .
finally , i also think that we should work much more closely together in the judicial field too .
the uk must ensure its dwindling gas supplies are kept as a national resource and not allow them to become an eu common resource .
in protest at the false charges and the lack of a fair trial she went on hunger strike .
a thorough consultation involving all stakeholders should take place in 2009 , with a view to considering stricter rules to be applied to this fishery .
there is also an urgent need to carry out a europe - wide campaign to make parents and teenagers aware of the dangers of child pornography on the internet .
i had great expectations that this would be a ruling that would have a knock - on effect on other countries in europe .
i believe that this will guarantee that the process is being conducted according to the approved agreement and that we will be able to eliminate any shortcomings in good time .
what kind of a idea is that , ladies and gentlemen ?
madam president , mr nuttall tells us that the requirement to recycle electrical waste puts up the price of products .
i am therefore opposed to the amendment to article 7 ( 3 ) , which deals with the radio frequency needs of specific eu policies and which proposes using civil frequencies for military purposes .
mr president , as a member of the delegation that went to palestine last week , it became clear to me that there are a number of sensible people who believe that the two - state option is dead in the water , largely because of israeli actions , not least the proposals to extend the wall even further into and beyond east jerusalem , thereby dividing the west bank into the north and the south .
in writing . - ( de ) harmonisation of the existing rules in this field is important as a means of optimising road transport in europe .
the existence of the financial perspectives is what has allowed the union 's programmes to be carried out .
consequently , we must make every effort to develop additional medium and long - term indicators for measuring the factors mentioned and the household level .
however , it is also out of the very limited budget for this instrument that the election observation missions are financed .

in addition , attempts by myself and others to ensure that the focus of the label remained on heritage , and not on political integration , were rejected .
all international organisations and governments should demand this .
the relocation of the 1.3 million homeless in port - au - prince in temporary housing is a very complex undertaking because of practical issues such as land ownership , rubble removal , urban planning and security .
i would like to close with a thought that will perhaps unite us all : i am able to remain quite composed throughout this entire debate for i really do believe that we are on the right road , because i know that the european car manufacturers and , more importantly , the european automotive suppliers - for they really are the driving force behind european industry - have not been asleep in recent years but have been working on a whole series of technological breakthroughs that will enable us to achieve our objectives .
it would certainly also be appropriate to discuss in the bureau the question of differing behaviour , which is partly dependent on the amount of time available .
social responsibility must work to this end and the european union - working through parliament - must restore and reinforce these principles in its every action , above all in dealing with non - member states whose citizens are denied fundamental rights .
this must not just be said to the elite , to businesspeople or to students .
this debate has shown a high degree of conviction right across the political and national spectrum .
last year in the committee on budgets we approved a proposal that i had written to create a body , a pilot project , to assess administrative burdens independently of the commission .
pay rises in europe are not keeping pace with company profits : in percentage terms , company profits are outstripping pay rises for workers .
while asking the chinese government to refrain from the excessive use of power , we have also to ask everybody in the world to refrain from using minority rights as a means for promoting geopolitical goals .
i agree with what mr daul said about neighbourhood terrorism and the middle east peace process as being some of the key objectives that we have in terms of the work we do this year .
i am delighted that the presidential elections that took place reflected the considerable progress made by ukraine and went better than previous elections , in particular , from the point of view of respect for citizens ' and political rights , including freedom of assembly , association and expression .
do you understand , mr alvaro ?
we want to make it easier for macedonia to navigate through these rocky waters , which is why , between now and the next strasbourg part - session , we want to work with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur to find a solution so that we can take a vote during the next strasbourg part - session .
then , on the basis of a relationship of trust between member states and the european union , we will begin negotiating the next financial perspective in order to better establish the focal point of our research and make it more european .
selecting sites to be awarded the label will also help to increase the younger generation 's interest in , and knowledge of , the ideas and peoples of europe , and , in so doing , will bring europe 's inhabitants closer together .
we should therefore professionalise it .
we should also remember the role of further training because it is that which promotes lifelong learning and prepares people for changes in the labour market .
this is at odds with the spirit of a democratic europe .
it is essential to create the adaptation fund and the inclusion of forests into a new climate protection agreement aimed at avoiding further deforestation and carbon emissions caused by forest fires .
however , there is one thing that cannot be disputed : we do need a greater concerted effort by , and more cooperation between , the member states , especially cooperation between the european institutions and the member states , in order to eliminate the threats posed by organised crime , which are wide - ranging and varied .
but we cannot ignore the reality of coal .
if the commission now increases this ceiling , it means that only the member states with a healthy budget can give this .
the reality is that we are adopting strategies we do not all believe in .
i would like to start with the bigger policy issue , on the eu improving its response capabilities .
secondly , it is clear to all of us that the challenges we are facing are getting more numerous and more complex .
mr president , for budget debates , there is a well - known law we call the law of the three ' ls ' , because budget debates involve reeling off litanies , like in a religious liturgy , which ends up causing economic lethargy .
the justification for this is that no similar demands were made of slovakia or poland , for example .
it is for this very reason that i like the paragraph in our resolution in preparation for the meeting which states that there is a desire to extend the aarhus convention to apply to all the principles of sustainable development .
we have dealt with this , i believe , in a balanced way .
we would like to make it possible for the eu vessels to go there , and to secure a level playing field for them because we are not the only vessels in these waters .
mr president , the point i would like to make is that there are many people here today who have not had a chance to ask mr barroso questions .
i voted against the report by mrs krehl on best practices in the field of regional policy and obstacles to the use of the structural funds .
not forgetting to mention , of course , the flexibility of the french presidency .
mr president , i wish to make three small points to add to what my fellow members have said .
in this spirit , the appointment of its members must be governed by criteria of capability and independence .
i am very worried that only 3 % of the fund has been used so far .
in writing . - i support this report which makes recommendations on a broad range of issues including discrimination , immigration , social rights and gender equality .
there was no violation , only a proposal by one parliamentarian ; there was no decision by parliament which could be blamed as a violation that happened .
first check the political stability of mercosur and then we will conclude trade agreements .
i would like , moreover , to congratulate our rapporteurs on their work and , more specifically , to mention the solvit network .
the ferreira report is part of the legislative package for reforming economic governance , which consists of six reports resulting from months of negotiations .
many of the restrictions stipulated by these regulations are no longer suited to the current economic and social situation , thereby necessitating new forms of intervention .
i would like to focus on the notion that citizens from the new member states must not be in an inferior position to those from third countries .
this is the great value of this directive , but more likely than not , as in many matters we have discussed in this house on road and transport safety , it is just the beginning , and not the end of the debate .
it is permissible to express these words of thanks .
commission president , i would also like to extend a very warm welcome to the many members of the commission who are present for this debate today .
i also insist that we need to demand the freedom of all the political prisoners and prisoners of conscience , in cuba and the rest of the world , but i nevertheless advise against taking action that has already proved to be a failure for cuba 's progression towards democracy and liberalisation , such as the embargo and the blockade .
the most important aspect of this agreement is that all participants recognise that road infrastructure safety is essential to improve safety on europe 's roads .
five years ago in december 2002 i was part of the european parliament 's election observation mission to kenya led by baroness nicholson .
'18a . takes note of the declaration by the gcc of 7 march 2011 in abu dhabi , which states that " the ministerial council demands that the security council takes the steps necessary to protect civilians , including a no - fly zone in libya " , which declaration has contributed to the decision of the arab league and then the united nations security council to pronounce themselves in favour of such a zone ; '
one - minute speeches on matters of political importance
vice - president of the commission . - mr president , honourable members , and , of course , especially mrs trüpel , we are absolutely fascinated by your report .
( applause )
in this respect , the cbrn action plan is an opportunity to put the treaty of lisbon solidarity clause into practice .
progress has been made with an agreement between the council and the libyan government , including on general principles such as the statute of rome and the united nations convention on refugees .
saying that is not getting involved in internal politics , that is being honest and i have to be honest , with all the responsibilities that i have , i have to say exactly what happened , whom we negotiated with and when .
article 24 does not oblige the presidency to inform or consult parliament , and so it is for the presidency , where applicable , to inform parliament of the state of negotiations .
it belongs to europe , whether we like it or not , and cooperation with it may soon be vitally important for europe .
1 .
this 4 % is , in turn , made up of two components . part 1 concerns the clean development mechanism ( cdm ) projects in the chain .
common eu rules to prevent exploitation and the employment of illegally staying workers are therefore one way of raising the bar for many eu countries .
it is not up to us at this moment to ascertain whether the responsibility might also be of a different kind , and severe penalties should be imposed if that is the case , but we would not be honest if we blamed politics alone .
it is therefore urgent to launch europe 2020 at the june european council and make sure that both the eu and its member states start the implementation immediately thereafter .
there are different problems for the pigmeat sector .
i would remind you that the whole financial system was in danger of meltdown at the end of 2008 .
at this point , i would like to stress the need to continue simplifying the procedures for using eu funds , the guarantee of their flexible use , the continuing use of gdp as the main criterion for determining regions ' eligibility under the cohesion policy and the need for a specific proposal from the commission on the use of public - private partnerships .
computer modelling and satellite technology are available to aid these situations but , even with all of this technology , we still seem to have been in a position of almost licking our finger and sticking it in the air to see which way the wind is blowing .
in order to set these leverage mechanisms in motion , which , from now until 2020 , will take the form of research , energy efficiency and internationalisation targets , particularly in small and medium - sized enterprises , there needs to be a strong political desire to activate incentives and orientation mechanisms .
on the other hand , the results of the commission 's studies are clearly not very conclusive , at least as regards the potential damage to the environment .
only a few months ago , for example , looking into a country 's statistical data was felt to be an intrusion with regard to national sovereignty .
these have affected the irish glass sector , and today , almost 600 workers are in a situation where they need assistance .
the position of the socialist group in the european parliament and that of parliament in general is very important to the countries that joined the eu in the 21st century , particularly as regards more stringent terms and objectives for reducing air pollution , the flexibility of implementation of these objectives and the coordination of long - term and short - term goals .
i should like to reply to two or three of those speeches .
mrs buitenweg said the 27 % was inconsequential , but i think it is a fair chunk out of what was promised .
the hungarian presidency began this half - year with great ambitions in the area of energy policy .
these penalties would be one of the means of avoiding financial and economic crises in euro area countries , such as the one that arose in greece a few months ago and which is still continuing .
however , it calls for cooperation and coordination on combating fraud and crime and addressing social and public order problems such as addiction and personal data protection .
i believe that , in the dialogue between the european union and russia on human rights , the question should be asked of whether the indigenous arctic people living in the russian federation get enough involvement in the work of the arctic council .
this is also , at the same time , my answer to mrs beer and the concept of human security .
this resolution speaks in terms very different from those used in south - eastern europe only as recently as a few years ago .
that is not acceptable , particularly when culture can be so very important in our national and regional development .
we must recognise that a new approach is needed .
the issue of minority language use in any state arises where there is an unwillingness to communicate or where there are other issues in the background .
article 171 was cited for the vote on the sesar joint undertaking .
i should therefore like to recall the conclusions adopted by the council on 6 december on the social dimension in the context of an integrated europe 2020 strategy .
this is a particularly important topic for me , as well as for the femmes au centre ( women at the centre ) association , which held a conference on the topic a few weeks ago in paris .
this week , we have also had the spectacle of one of the leading climate - research centres in the uk , which advises the government , being caught altering data and stifling debate .
( de ) madam president , madam vice - president , today i would like to talk about internal security and the work programme .
if we do not maximise every country 's energies and opportunities , we shall all lose out in the end .
as they allow for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions , we saw fit to tolerate the substances that they contain .
( for the results and other details on the vote : see minutes )
a third item may be added .
it is intolerable that today , in an immense open - air ghetto , a people is slowly dying , hounded by the cameras of the whole world , a people bled dry , without the right to develop , to move freely or to educate its children , but a people for whose survival we pay a high price and who most of all must not die on us , because that would taint us and our democracies could not cope with it .

labels will not reduce obesity .
in addition to unlawful bunkering practices , the continual spillage of pollutants , albeit in small quantities , and accidents involving spillage of cargo are threatening to transform a protected area into a sewer .
the dossiers are complex and the inclusion of issues which are member state competences , such as public expenditure in the area of health , does not help matters .
i am therefore pleased that my amendment on this matter was adopted and that , when the farmer makes his single application and declares the area used for agricultural purposes , he must also agree to comply with criteria relating to public health , animal welfare and respect for the environment .
we will raise these issues not only within the united nations process , but also in other settings in order to help build the necessary momentum .
i feel that to say the problem is that the word ' jihad ' must disappear in one section , when it subsequently appears in three sections , and again in recital h that jihadism is doubtless the main focus of the type of terrorism we are dealing with , is looking for excuses that do not hold water .
i will take , by way of supplementary questions , only the author of the question because we do not have enough time to do more if we are to get through enough questions .
because , ladies and gentlemen , the reason why these crosses appear on these flags is no different from the reason why crucifixes are displayed in italian classrooms , and it is not a religious reason but rather a cultural and traditional one .
i believe you will agree , mr zahradil , that 27 different bureaucracies are worse than one bureaucracy .
so the european institutions and we , the members of parliament , are obliged to reaffirm our determination to uphold fundamental freedoms and to condemn and combat any manifestation of racism and xenophobia by means of law .
we also think it important for more efforts to be made at every level of decision - making to use all available financial instruments for the deployment and take - up of new ict - based technological solutions that enhance energy efficiency .
there is also a need for confidence in our shared commitment to preserve our particular brand of social market economy , and in our long - term agenda for a low - carbon economy .
firstly , do you believe that , during the spanish presidency , we will succeed in making headway with regard to visa arrangements for kosovo , so that kosovo will not remain a prison within a free balkans region ?
finally , i have two specific questions .
numerous members have said and i too wish to emphasise the fact that this is a rare occurrence and must of necessity be taken into account in the commission 's final decision .
eu support , particularly from the european globalisation adjustment fund , is fundamental in helping those who have lost their jobs due to the relocations that have occurred in a globalised market .
eu - brazil agreement on civil aviation safety (
( pl ) madam president , western sahara is , today , at a crossroads .
madam president , i congratulate and thank all colleagues in bringing us to a successful conclusion today .
i think this is something we also have to acknowledge : that they play this important role and that we need to have , like the european central bank , a real , independent supervisory structure which can deal with these subjects .
the path that we were put on under germany 's auspices must now lead to the best possible result for all european workers , across all european sites .
fortunately , the number of incidents related to cbrn materials , including acts of terrorism , has been relatively low .
towards a reform of the world trade organisation ( debate )
revision of the broadcasting communication - state aid for public broadcasting ( debate )
in order to be active citizens , people must have a broader world view . and the opportunity to get out of a totalitarian country .
however , it contains nothing that shows how the eu wishes to contribute to the success of the development round .
we are talking about vulnerable and often abandoned children who sometimes disappear from sight .
that is why the icesave dispute must remain a bilateral issue between iceland , the uk and the netherlands .
after all , this muslim country is unique in that it took the first steps to adapting european values almost 100 years ago and despite the various historical winds , it did not go off the road .
that in itself is a political decision .
the lukashenko regime , or the people of belarus ?
after 14 february , when we have received the responses of individual member states - especially those whose agenda for adopting the necessary regulations we do not yet know - on which any decision of the commission to start infringement procedures will depend , we will consider our position again and see where the infringement procedure will start .
we must make it quite clear that this would be a disaster for everyone who lives near an airport .
the report correctly emphasises the importance of ratifying the comprehensive nuclear - test - ban treaty .
the european union cannot have a credible strategy of labour protection without providing financial support to the member states .
the ruling regime should immediately lift all restrictions on free speech and fundamental rights , including bans on peaceful political activity .
over the years , the traditional role of peace missions has changed .
now that the us congress has pledged its full support for boeing , it is the duty of the european commission and europe as a whole to make a political commitment to the airbus cause .
i could also mention that we are encouraging smes to play an active part in the activities of the european institute of innovation and technology , to ensure that they can also benefit from the transfer of knowledge that institute will promote .
we still have not clarified the terms of the repayments and responsibilities , nor have we set out how the banks will be supervised .
let us reject double standards and respect our own actions and words , and remember that what brought us together more than 50 years ago were human rights .
as part of the revision of the cap reform , it is being taken into consideration for tackling challenges such as mitigation and adaptation to climate change and , as you are aware , within european policy development , common agricultural policy is considered to be an important factor to be taken into account in relation to a broader policy of tackling climate change .
it puts citizens at the core of our policies by facilitating the exercise of their specific rights .
lowering the 80 % threshold to 75 % would not solve our problems .
it is ironic that a sincere vote today means voting with your eyes closed .
the ten - t policy has supported the preparation of this major european project until now , and once it becomes operational , it will be possible to use the transport infrastructure much more efficiently .
however , we want a reliable multiannual solution for iter , but you should not complain about current cuts while the management structures of iter are poor .
developing countries need aid to reduce poverty and isolation , measures that contribute to development and measures necessary to exit the crisis , especially in this difficult period .
1 .
furthermore , i believe in the principle that the polluter pays , and i also voted in favour of the amendment calling for an assessment of the costs , monitoring , the sending of regular reports to the european commission and the participation of national governments .
examples of this include the case of the so - called cia flights and the complicity of many eu countries ' governments in the kidnapping , torture and illegal transfer of prisoners to guantánamo bay and the continued occupation of afghanistan by nato forces and the successive massacres of civilian populations under the pretext of combating terrorism .
i would therefore ask the commission to reassess the relevant text .
this benefits nobody , especially when it concerns the scale of the human tragedy resulting from forest fires .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , all the institutions have been ambitious in this project , though not all in the same direction .
the future of the european economy lies in the service sector and the knowledge economy .
my group is in favour of the proposals and amendments that oblige the member states to resolve the issues of payment and compatibility in a six - month period instead of protracting it for a year and a half .
cod in the north sea , which is being fished even before its reproductive age , is a typical example .
going further , while this directive , or proposal for a directive , includes many good things , there are , however , several places where it goes too far .
who would like to speak in favour ?
there was a lack of transparency in 2009 and 2010 in the way in which we dealt with the h 1n1 strain of influenza , designated by the world health organisation as a pandemic .
i do not believe that this is a good way to proceed .
correct it how ?
as i said yesterday in the debate on the financial crisis , the commission , for the first time , has managed within 24 hours to get proposals on the table .
that is part of the discussion , as you know , that is currently going on .
this is not just a useful financial instrument , but also offers greater transparency in relation to how the eu is financed .
copd is a common and costly lung disease whose advanced stage is chronic respiratory failure .
if this was accepted , it would have cost eur 2 billion to the european economy and hundreds of jobs across the union .
we will see tomorrow how the members from germany have voted , because there is a labelling loophole here .
russia has got used to the equivocation of the eu .
( hu ) thank you , mr president .
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the european union cannot perform its function as a reliable and stable global partner unless it remains able to act and pursues a refined strategy that responds to the specific needs of different countries .
neither the language law nor any of the previous topics raised here by the hungarian members have any detrimental effect on members of ethnic minorities .

as well as being an incontestable principle of the civilised world , and not least in a europe that sees itself as culturally and socially developed , ensuring the equal treatment of self - employed men and women - particularly as regards access to social protection mechanisms , above all , those relating to maternity - is becoming even more pressing and obvious during this long period of profound economic and social crisis .
we in this house do not think of the elephant in the way that the african does .
when it comes to governance and eu 2020 , we are looking for an adequate balance in how to motivate the member states in a positive way , and at the same time how to ask for better , stronger , efforts from their side .
with reference to the increase of the de minimis threshold , this is not a new issue .
the gas crisis which we have just survived has clearly demonstrated once again how important a secure , reliable and cheap energy supply is for the eu .

rising european unemployment means greater co 2 emissions .
betraying his electoral promises , mr sarkozy now says he wishes to continue negotiations , and in fact start up fresh negotiations in areas ' not directly linked to accession ' , according to a formula as demagogic as it is hypocritical which solves no problems whatsoever .
these mutual interests must be handled positively and constructively , and where external policy is concerned , this naturally also means that russia must take on some responsibility .
furthermore , the south sudan government should begin to enact foreign investment policies that would attract foreign investment in natural resources and would thus contribute to the policy of poverty reduction .
i doubt very much if eamon healy , the farmer i just mentioned , is aware of our debate here this morning .

if you drive your car , mr barroso , down the road , and the brakes only work 79 % of the time , you will no doubt at some point crash .
it is a pity that the house 's reaction to the communication threatened to get bogged down in a policy debate on whether or not these longer heavier vehicles - ecocombis or gigaliners - should be allowed , as mr savary said just now .
for this reason we will not be supporting this report .
in particular , the planned joint action for the introduction of a bank levy or financial transaction tax at a global level should also be emphasised in this context .
we should not forget about it , because this will give us great opportunities in the future .
it has been announced for this year , and so this would not mean too much of a delay .
however , if you look at the current economic recovery plans at european and national level , you will see that they consist of a lot of words , but that the objectives of sustainability , climate protection and the efficient use of resources are still not being taken seriously .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as a new mep , let me start by saying that human rights issues are also extremely important to my party , the german left , and that we condemn any violation of human rights - irrespective of where or by whom they are committed .

we are seeking a way for them to be strong enough to resist the coming recession and with the activities which are most likely to be profitable on those sites , and there lies the opportunity for both of the shipyards , once the assets are bundled , taking into account that there are a couple of potential investors who are interested in just giving them a viable future .
madam president , we talk a lot about the melting of the ice caps , but as well as the arctic and the antarctic , there is also the ' third pole ' : the himalayan ice cap and its glaciers which give water to some two billion people - almost a third of the world 's population - in china , india and elsewhere on the subcontinent .
this is to support and fund the action of the numerous civil society organisations , so that they can further their undermining role within these countries and promote the interventionist plans of the eu .

in writing . - i agree with the rapporteur on the need to emphasise the importance of data gathering , proportionate regulation , airport and airspace capacity , and environmental sustainability , whilst acknowledging the importance of one of the fastest - growing industries of our time .
lastly , i should also like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs , the secretariat staff and the experts who assisted us . this work took more than 14 months , and there were 1 690 amendments .
quite the contrary : trade leads to development , duties lead to poverty .
it is being said that the cause of the media hysteria is a desire to get rid of stocks of vaccines and the ineffective drug tamiflu which are taking up shelf space in pharmaceutical warehouses , and an attempt to divert attention from the world crisis .

humanitarian catastrophes and other unforeseeable events can unleash a wave of refugees , to which we must be able to respond jointly , within an eu framework .
the european parliament has one clear demand to make before the commission starts negotiating the methods of exchanging pnr data with the united states , canada and australia : the protection of personal data is too sensitive a subject for these negotiations to be conducted exclusively among member states , behind closed doors .
i hope that the commission 's new single market act will be truly ambitious .
it will assess its effectiveness , its speed , and respect for guarantees of defence .
that could be an aim - why not ?
i would also like to emphasise that we share the european parliament 's concerns about the proceedings against the justice and development party ( akp ) .
however , for all that , there are nine member states that are asking for enhanced cooperation .
not even temporarily and certainly not if we have servers here in europe and no longer just in the us , because the data will continue to be sent to the us nonetheless and legal protection will not be guaranteed .
that is why a european system for an order allowing the attachment of bank accounts seems to be such an appropriate and necessary solution .
of course , this aid will stop after 2010 and our farmers will be wiped out , just like the acp producers , not to mention workers .
mr schulz has already pointed out that we live in a changing world , a world in which china is strong , india is growing in strength , brazil is growing in strength and the united states of america is still as strong as ever .

after the directive on trafficking in human beings and the imminent directive on the victims of violence , announced by commissioner malmström , i think that the treaty of lisbon has laid the basis for achieving greater legal harmonisation in the way member states acknowledge the importance of crimes of violence against women and children as specific forms of violence , as well as defining the essential standards of services for consulting , legal assistance and protection for women and children in cooperation with ngos .
i am thinking of the attitude adopted by mr borghezio in the recent cologne demonstration as , if this framework decision were valid , he would certainly be accused of provocation to terrorism .
good ideas soon become international .

commissioner , we urge the commission to issue an initiative for the establishment of independent bodies to control eavesdropping devices in member states .
unfortunately , we have seen in the existing agreement that this is almost never the case .
given these numerous abuses of power over the past eight years by member states , and in the light of the commission 's proposed communication on a stocktaking of counter - terrorism policies , can the commission provide details of specific measures it plans to take to ensure that eu counter - terrorism policies prevent such abuses in the future ?
the amended regulation should , in future , better mitigate the risk of fraud or manipulation of statistics , or of any other kind of irregularity .

these are private businesses , independent of the public authorities , which meet the needs and demands of their members and the general interest .
and are we going to impose similar restrictions when a copyright is infringed in other ways ?
( es ) madam president , firstly i would like to thank mr florenz for his generosity and open - mindedness as well as all the groups that participated in this political exercise and debate on both background issues and the future .

mobile cranes and truck jibs are used for public hangings and , as there is no drop , this subjects the person being executed to a slow , painful death by asphyxiation .
let us not mince words : russia is sliding down the slippery slope to becoming a full - blown dictatorship with a strong leader : a strong leader who will not tolerate any protest and who deploys his secret fsb police whenever he thinks it necessary ; a leader who will not give up power under any condition and who will use all kind of trickery to keep his hands on the reins of power after the parliamentary elections in december and the presidential elections in march .
therefore , all of us in this house and the press have a responsibility to ensure that , behind what we do , there is a critical , but also true , picture of what the issue is all about .
we know that figure is rising , unlike in the housing and energy sectors , where the figure is falling .
( pl ) mr president , commissioner , at the outset , i would like to stress that i consider the report to be particularly important , and to congratulate the rapporteur , mr luhan , on an excellent job .

i am also extremely grateful that the european parliament has , in some way , become a sounding board for all the legitimate demands that fall under the defence of human rights .
the decision to enter into dialogue with the authorities in kosovo is especially important to stability in the area .
mr president , i understand that the free university of minsk is today situated in vilnius , lithuania .
in my view , it is extremely important to improve parking facilities for heavy goods vehicles on a europe - wide basis ; that is a key element of safety management .

in this respect , the rules of procedure must be changed .
the centre in vienna was known for its unreliability and the ease with which complaints about racism and anti - semitism were abused - this was the case , for example , in 2001 and 2005 with regard to radio maryja , the republican league and my own country , poland .
before we focus our debate on the international negotiations , i should like to comment briefly on an issue which was very rightly highlighted in the report .
will this argument be taken up by the commission ?

fighting tax havens all over the world is not solely a matter of justice in tax but , above all , one of social justice .
a good compromise solution has emerged , as we have also heard from the remarks by our fellow members , and this is indeed due to the fact that there has been exemplary cooperation between the council , the commission and the european parliament .
it rightly demands that this contribution should appear in national accounts .
that is why we need preventive budgetary surveillance and effective enforcement as proposed in the package and indeed by your rapporteurs and your committee .
the directives and declarations of the european parliament must apply to everyone , even italy .
women make up a significant proportion of the population that is at risk of poverty , partly on account of the usual discrimination that is still prevalent from all sides in connection with wages and pensions and partly due to their very common precarious working conditions .
it could be an education society , which also extends to body education and exercise .
i would remind him that democracy is a method whereby you vote for people who govern you and then , if you do not like what they do , you can get rid of them , turf them out and put somebody else in .
one might ask how much this will amount to .
i honestly believe that the presidency 's answer hit the nail on the head .
the government of kosovo must also push ahead with its decentralisation programme .
you may find a few hundred examples of these within the framework of the internal market of individual states and it is in my view an open question .
the opt - out method weakens the community of values .
there can be no doubt that , in the recent riots in xinjiang province , many innocent han chinese were brutally murdered .
the text also protects consumers , whose interests - i stress - are central to our policies .
men are also interested in cosmetics - more and more so , in fact .
the trauma of rape is aggravated by the fact that many of the victims then suffer social discrimination and ostracism by their families and communities .
the text stipulates that heavy goods vehicles shall pay the cost of air and noise pollution .
the report has all the important components as regards fundamental rights .

in view of the fact that we must count on further losses through climate change , european forestry finds itself in a difficult and risky situation .
thank you , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , and thank you in particular to my colleague .
in any event , we need more frequent and better controls as well as information on the rules , not just for drivers from our member states but also for drivers from third countries .
in the european colonial period attempts were made to change that situation , but not with a view to equality and equal rights for the hutus .
' expresses its strong willingness to enter into negotiations with the council on the basis of the commission 's proposal for a revision of the mff 2007-2013 for eur 5 billion in the framework of the proposed european economic recovery plan ; takes note of the conclusions of the december 2008 european council in that respect ' .

there are new elements , because it means the extension of the scope of the programme to the doctoral level ; it means third - country universities are enabled to participate in the joint programmes ; it will provide full study scholarships to european students to follow joint master and doctorate courses .
it is just as dangerous , as it causes different forms of cancer and different forms of illnesses .
the minimum measures needed to save it were taken in a climate of emergency , but let us not delude ourselves : the pressurised conditions , the direct interests of the main member states , and the painful and slow nature of the decisions have led to the precarious image that the public and the world have of the euro and the european union .
i would like to suggest to the president , mr buzek , that we redress the situation by inviting shen yun to stage a sample performance in the parliament at the earliest convenient date .

in all our involvement with them we have always advanced the principles of pluralistic democracy , freedom of the media , of expression and of assembly , respect for human rights , an independent judiciary , and good governance .
do i think we can do much more ?
in addition , article 176 points out that the european regional development fund is intended to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the union through participation in the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining industrial regions .
however , at the 10th eu - china summit in beijing on 28 november , the european union was represented by its president , by the trade commissioner and by the economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
then we must tackle the issue of where we only want to make proposals for standards to be observed in national law and where we want to create european law .
what we have at present is too ambitious .
there is no doubt that ageing populations are a concern in many countries .
the british prime minister has a problem .
i think we need to remain very aware of that when we make a balanced assessment of our negotiations with turkey .
however , it is very clear that we have to go for universal acceptance of the statute and of the court .
that is the only way that we will manage to deliver aid more effectively .

after all , that is how it works for every one of our citizens in the eu : if their house burns down , for example , or ice crushes the roof , they receive compensation only from their insurance companies , if they are insured at all .
we are not naive , therefore , in our relationship with the united states , but nor do we want to pre - judge its intentions .
secondly , i am delighted that we have together managed to grant european dairy farmers financial support .
however , any legislation that comes forward to regulate this sector must be from the national sporting bodies or authorities such as fifa and uefa .
i refer to a number of comments made by mrs hohlmeier , to which i would add this : we are saying that , after six months , the burden of proof for people being prosecuted in their country shifts to the member state , not to the asylum seeker ; this alone creates bureaucracy and may be used by some as an argument for abuse .
the irish vote encourages us in our european action and , at the same time , it links us .
it is the overriding duty of the european union to press for measures aimed at safe sea shipping at international level , as has already happened in the european union .

the major problem in europe is the lack of competitiveness .
member of the commission . - mr president , the equality directives started in the 1970s and since then , many directives have not only changed laws in the member states - there were no laws in the member states at that time - but have created the laws in the member states , the laws of equality between men and women at all levels of our society .
that means we have to be more determined to act .
we are working actively with the member states in the council towards agreement on the final regulation .
the european union has already implemented rules , which will come into force at the end of the year .

all the political parties in georgia - both government and opposition - must do everything within their power to improve the atmosphere in the run - up to the elections and to establish a truly democratic political culture .
will the commission do it ?
this is one level .
a progressive export and liberalisation model for trade has been pushed on these countries , if necessary , by resorting to blackmail .
we are a long way from the unequal treatment of women on pensions and the remedies on which the committee on women 's rights and gender equality wished to predicate its report .
draftsman of the opinion of the committee on petitions . - mr president , in the minute i have on behalf of the committee on petitions , i would like to do three things .
to conclude the debate , i have received one motion for a resolutionpursuant to rule 115(5 ) of the rules of procedure .
( de ) mr president , in the speech made by our esteemed colleague mr kacin , there were two things missing , in my view .

the rapporteur stated that transparency is a two - way street .

these small companies create the majority of jobs , and have the highest capacity to reinvent themselves and take the greatest role in innovation and preventing the european economy from falling even further behind .
the more that those on the right oppose what has been said , the more it becomes clear from your speech , mr brown , that we are on the right path .

we are discussing reducing administrative burdens now , but in the future we will also need to work on reducing compliance costs .
in some countries , travel agents are liable just like package tour operators ; in other countries , like mine for example , travel agents are only intermediaries .
this is why we have voted against .
thank you , mr zapatero , too , for stressing the role of the european parliament , a role which has grown significantly with the entry into force of the treaty of lisbon , and it is that cooperation between the european council , the council of ministers and the european parliament which will be the basis of future interinstitutional structure and balance in the european union .
if you blend blood , then you make contaminated blood .
i urge us , at this stage , not to level down our ambitions in terms of either targets or deadlines .

in contrast with other times when the european parliament , in non - binding discussions , accepted the principle that workers ' representatives should have the right of veto , as in my report on the role of women in industry , it has now refused to include this in the directive on the european works council , which is regrettable .
the european asylum support office will provide a coordinated approach to the common european asylum policy .

we need to improve flexibility in this area .
i therefore welcome mrs niebler 's initiative and stress the importance of continuity and constancy in the diplomatic relations between the eu and russia in order to ensure that the international geopolitical balance is maintained .
we cannot have a pick - and - mix strategy allowing everyone to do the easy parts , the feel - good things , and leave the real challenges to the others .
financial instruments are required .
this means there will have to be interinstitutional talks .
( de ) mr president , for a long time now , all the sports organisations have been calling for sport to be given greater significance and , indeed , greater visibility than has hitherto been the case , and we are acting on this call today .
firstly , the setting of high energy - efficiency standards in europe for household goods such as fridges , dishwashers , microwave ovens and so on can not only lead to a reduction in co 2 emissions here , but also create the conditions for higher standards elsewhere .

it shows that , although the structural funds were not originally intended as emergency funding and should not , in future , be regarded as such , if necessary , they can be sufficiently flexible to make a suitable contribution in times of crisis .
however , the commission regrets the fact that the chinese authorities have reacted by putting his wife , mrs liu xia , under house arrest , and by restricting freedom of movement for many of his friends .
i consider this connection to be inextricable and hope that the timetable which has now been submitted will result in our finding a true consensus between the european institutions on the question of the internal market in energy within the next few months .
mr president , as we know , this report calls for an extension of the prüm treaty into the fight against cross - border terrorism .
therefore , mr solana was undoubtedly too quick off the mark - as the council has also said - in taking a stance , in signalling his intention to attend , without having a mandate from the council and without having heard the opinion of the european parliament .
the sport is subject to licence in finland and closely supervised , and there is guidance available from experienced hunters in the safe and responsible use of weapons .
there are a number of policy areas involved here - budgetary policy , policy in the judicial sphere , in relation to internal affairs - but the most important one for me is foreign policy .

it is also giving the commission every opportunity , as a budgetary authority , so that this can happen .
we have given the floor to six members of your group .
as you all know , much progress has been made over the last month on this important proposal as a result of joint efforts .
the thinking is that the united kingdom can nationalise the banks while others - france , in particular - can recapitalise them .
however , it is also important that , as the developed world , we not only live up to our historic responsibility , we also need to do something , and , above all , we must find a successor regulation for the kyoto protocol .
we are concerned here not with an arrangement with industry brought about by the commission , as was once the case , for example , with the reduction of co 2 emissions from motor cars , but rather with a sort of automatic development .
all of what the council said on the supposed implementation of article 20 of the treaty , the ' lead state ' , video conferences and joint centres , is pure science fiction in an emergency .

this militant xenophilia and anti - patriotism are very wearing .

we want the kyoto protocol itself to retain its importance for the environment and , above all , we want to avoid creating a financial bubble at the expense of european businesses .
freedom of movement for individuals must not make it easier for criminals to avoid being held accountable for criminal acts committed on the territory of another member state .
in writing . - ( pt ) europe is faced with an increase in migration flows resulting from the instability that many countries are experiencing , and this represents a challenge for the eu .
these peoples , quite rightly , have been imprudent in calling for their freedom , but i hope above all that they will have awakened our consciences .
however , the commission considers that the procedures to be applied in the different cases covered by the report have to fully respect the relevant provisions of the treaties , notably article 215 , and of the framework agreement , so as to reflect the legal and institutional differences between them .
i agree with the rapporteur and the resolutions on discharge when they draw attention to the urgency of introducing a national declaration at an appropriate political level , covering all eu funds coming under shared management , in order that each member state take responsibility for the management of eu funds received .
in europe we could reduce co 2 emissions by millions of tons for the benefit of our major export industries if only we were courageous enough .
many of the citizens of europe were annoyed about this .
has the commission already formed an opinion on this question and , if so , what line will it pursue in negotiations ?
take the blinkers off !
this means that the new negotiations will be conducted by a different group of people .
incidentally , no one will defend european law as resolutely as i do .
this agreement will ensure a stable framework for temporary employment agencies whose role in the european labour market is undeniable .
i believe that not just in the european parliament and the commission , but also at ministerial level and the level of heads of state , constant attention needs to be paid to belarus and the situation in it , because belarus is a country that shares a border with the eu .
( es ) mr president of the commission , as you are aware , the members that belong to the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament want a real change in europe 's social agenda and a renewed social agenda .

in writing . - i strongly support smoking bans in public places to protect public health and to avert the dangers of passive smoking .
yet despite that drop , europe remains the biggest donor , especially in africa , and we hope the drop will only be temporary .
this is a significant step forward and , at the same time , sends a positive signal to the outside world .
( applause )
mr schnellhardt said that we should act promptly and mr arsenis asked particularly , with regard to the timetable : when will this end ?
brian crowley said to president klaus that the irish wish for the lisbon treaty .
patients today wishing to avail themselves of medical services in a country other than their own come up against many administrative and financial obstacles .
we hope that the ban on the advance payment of any sums during the withdrawal period and the imposition of staggered payments where long - term holiday products are sold will be positive contributions .

all of the union 's member states have developed ict policies and consider these technologies to be an essential contribution to domestic growth and employment in the context of the renewed lisbon strategy .
i have to tell you , president - in - office , that i am disappointed with the council 's new proposal , as parliament 's key demands have not been taken into account , and i think it provides a level of data protection that in some respects still falls below that of council of europe convention 108 .
i wish to conclude by expressing the hope that the positive expectations arising from the directive will also be met .
it also seems essential to me that access to public contracts by smes - who account for 99 % of all european businesses and over 100 million jobs - be improved as soon as possible .
illegal employment should be punished , and its negative consequences should , first and foremost , be felt by employers , and only later affect the workers themselves .
in this context , combating job insecurity , particularly for women , represents a very constructive contribution to social stability and gender equality , one of the fundamental values espoused by the european union .
similarly , improvements are urgently needed to agencies ' internal audit procedures , and i welcome the possibility of having an inter - agency disciplinary board .
ladies and gentlemen , we must try to deal with the effects of the reversal of the question times that we have had , by attempting to respect all and give everyone the chance to put their questions .
madam president , today the workers of vf and bortex have a better idea of what solidarity means and a better idea of what the european union means , and i , from here , salute them .

we have known for a long time what a bad condition haiti is in , and how badly its structures function .
as regards multilingualism , european policies to promote language diversity must take into account that not only official languages exist but also regional and minority languages .
through its work and reports in the relevant committees - economic crisis committees in particular - parliament is already providing valuable contributions to the deliberations of the task force .
they were in government when it all happened .
if we are serious about mobility in europe , then these kinds of issues should not arise .
this point must be regulated immediately at the very least .
that seems to me to be a sanction that would hit the politicians , but not the people .
the domenici report gives an account of how to close those back doors .
while aspects of the climate package were on the agenda at last week 's summit meeting , and a requirement from that summit that any future revisions on amendments to aspects of eu ets be available to be considered by future summits , at the subsequent trialogue on saturday morning in brussels , i added , with the full support of all the shadow rapporteurs , a new recital to my report - subsequent to the summit - which was then accepted by coreper on saturday afternoon .

( fr ) mr president , minister , mr almunia , first of all , on 3 september , germany , the united kingdom and france reached an agreement , spoke with one voice to express a european consensus on the matter of the supervision of traders ' bonuses .
this is clearly not a sufficient reason for the eu to stop advancing towards the establishment of the free trade area it agreed to with those same despots .
more than ever we need to attend to the double dimension of the subject : on the one hand , ensuring equality in all policy areas ( gender mainstreaming ) and , on the other hand , introducing targeted measures to curb discrimination against women , including awareness - raising campaigns , the exchange of best practice , dialogue with citizens and public - private partnership initiatives .
we indicated that the votes would be postponed until 12.15 or 12.20 , so please let us carry on with the answers from our commissioners .
secondly , this week , in my country , the chancellor of the exchequer has imposed higher fuel taxes on british car and freight drivers without understanding the consequences of his actions .
we must reach an agreement sooner rather than later because , if we fail to do so , the only victims in this conflict will be the political parties , who play a vital role in bringing the eu nearer to the citizens and encouraging them to get involved in politics so that they feel part of a common political project and a political future .
today there are nearly 5 000 websites contributing to the radicalisation of young people in europe on these issues , and the slovenian presidency , as you know , managed to secure an agreement on these challenges at the justice and home affairs council meeting on 18 april .
that is good , and it is especially good that the committee wants to tighten up these requirements even further .
we strongly support measures to end discrimination , including additional measures , but cannot at this stage support a call for further eu directives in this area .
another case is that of nixon moreno , a student leader at the university of the andes , elected to the university council several times and president of the federation of university centres .
the advantages of the european arrest warrant by far outweigh any possible inconveniences .

the new rules will cover almost all sales made in shops , by phone or online but will particularly strengthen the rules on cross - border transactions .
substance was in short supply here too .
( heckling )
compliance with nuclear safety standards and protection for the population against nuclear risk are particularly important aspects which justify the funding granted by the european union to the three member states for decommissioning their nuclear power stations , which could have no longer been modernised to meet the highest safety standards .
the vote will take place on wednesday , 11 may 2011 .
we intend to be ambitious and comprehensive in tackling all challenges .
in this sense , though we have tabled several amendments , they are in essence one and the same , and since it is a technical amendment that does not alter our overall opinion of the proposal , we appeal to the common sense of all members in order that this amendment be approved .
in fact , during all this time , captain dadis camara , who assumed power , has promised that he will drop out of the contest and not present himself as a candidate .

i think that is wrong .
in the case in question here , i can confirm that all of this can be verified and checked and that we have all the procedures with which you , moreover , and i are familiar .
the decision has , in fact , already been taken , and the cereals will be placed on the market at the end of this month .

it is true that we , in sweden , have better social insurance systems , but the reimbursement rates have fallen from 80 % .
the second dimension is the close link between food products and energy sources and the interrelationship between their prices .
only europe 's wonderful regions can safeguard that specialness and they must be able to rely on the protection of the european union .
then , we also need reform with regard to the rating agencies , even if the latter are like weather forecasts : either they are too flexible and we want them to be slightly more inflexible , or they are too inflexible and we want them to be slightly more flexible .
that is why , ladies and gentlemen , i am asking you to consider three courses of action .
eu citizens demanded we take action to keep the products of the cruel commercial hunt out of the eu .
besides , european interference in this dossier is unacceptable .
i simply have a plea to my colleagues in parliament and to the commission : please , let us think in future about the unintended consequences of our legislation .
i therefore believe that , instead of suffering globalisation , we can shape it , because we are , by nature , a globalisation laboratory ; we are the champions of global governance .
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , as you well know , agriculture is an economic sector that comprises specific features that mean that public intervention may occasionally be necessary , if not desirable , in the interests of producers , consumers and the public .

we would like to thank you for voting with us on the closure of tax havens and on solidarity with the member states .

this mainly means that there has to be europe - wide commitment to training and research very soon .
it is not a case of generous people on the one hand and heartless people on the other .
funds are also lacking when it comes to technology demonstration , for example carbon capture and storage .
i sincerely hope that as meps we can agree on these positions , because they truly represent a new social europe .
the commission 's answers to the request for information reached italy just a couple of weeks ago .
of the advocated measures , i would stress : effective and flexible meat - market mechanisms ; combating speculation on cereals and the creation of a safety net in this sector ; adequate protection of farm workers in the most disadvantaged areas , and greater power for producer organisations .
they are making croatia a better country and a better society for its citizens and by that , croatia is becoming a better neighbour and contributing to europe , because fights against organised crime or corruption must be made across borders , and it is an advantage for us to see the achievements made in croatia .
however , we must not forget that here , we are debating the amendment of a regulation and therefore , the continued cooperation of all european union institutions and common agreement on the revision of transparency rules are imperative .
railways are included in the emissions trading system , but buses are not , which again puts buses at an advantage and trains at a disadvantage .
it is indicated in this agency 's accounts that revenue was recorded , which was accrued from interest amounting to more than eur 143 000 for the financial year 2008 , which highlights that the agency has a high volume of liquidity over long periods .

it is also important to implement joint projects on renewable energy in collaboration with the union 's neighbouring countries , so that all europe 's renewable energy resources can be used more efficiently , effectively and sustainably .
what should be stressed above all is the fact that we are still below the ceiling of 20 % of the overall administrative expenditure of the european institutions .
tax competition is a good thing .
that is the problem , and that is the point originally raised in relation to the recast versions under review .

yet here he is , hiding in the eu , away from his faithful supporters .
by touching on these topics and others of interest to europe 's citizens , the report and recommendations from mr lambsdorff mark a step forward , which is why i am voting for it .
this is an organisation which upholds sharia as the basis of human rights and which is holding the united nations hostage with its undisguised anti - semitism .
however , this problem cannot be a pretext for creating other , larger ones .
this will ensure a quick withdrawal of the european union from every domestic area .
however , we do need to take into account the fact that tajikistan has recently made progress both in combating corruption and improving the human rights situation , as well as various other sensitive areas .
however the eu cannot do everything on its own : it must cooperate more with the relevant international organisations ( ilo , wto , oecd ) , in particular , for combating the phenomenon of free zones , as these go against any social legislation .
i draw your attention to this and i hope that the spirit of cooperation will remain .
mr barroso , i was critical when the greek members of my group voted against the programme for greece .

it permits the cultivation of certain gmos and the consumption of products deriving from genetically modified fodder , such as meat from non - member countries .
i hope that in this year the commission will focus on regions where poverty and social exclusion are at their most acute .

i should therefore like to congratulate the committee on development and also mrs van lancker , who have made sure that this debate is being held here today and that tomorrow , we will be adopting a resolution which gives a detailed account of what has gone wrong .
i myself believe that the common european external action service will definitely improve our opportunities to take human rights into account in all our work , though this will not happen by itself .
the presence at the negotiations in geneva of the commissioner who is here today was also appreciated .
if we talk about parliament 's position with external bodies , for example , with human rights organisations which could be affected by this and if we fail to come to an agreement , although i hope that this is not the case , and if individual projects cannot then take place , i believe that there is support and understanding for parliament 's position .
i have emphasised how important schengen is , what a gift it is to the european union and that we must strengthen it and not weaken it .
the next item is the report by mr ehler , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council amending directive 94/19 / ec on deposit guarantee schemes as regards the coverage level and the payout delay - c 6-0361/2008 - .
imports are necessary .

in the years since it was created , the arctic council has been a model of cooperation in managing shared problems .
i am very critical of this european parliament in any case , but it does have to take care not to make itself a hopeless laughing stock and turn into a kind of clone of the supreme soviet .
this is needed to boost hopes of maintaining the comparative advantage of the eu 's developmental capabilities .
the mayors there need our help too .
mr sarkozy , the path to be followed lies elsewhere .
( de ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i believe we are faced time and again with the question of the right way to proceed in our political dealings with china .
while making these amendments , we also clarified a number of other points in the regulation on the basis of past experience , particularly in relation to the introduction of the ertms ( european rail traffic management system ) and registers of rolling stock .
the priority to be assigned to agriculture in development policies is also an issue to be addressed , especially as the commission is preparing to adapt and reform development policy .
this suggestion allows an economy of scale in financial , human and technical resources .
i would like to thank mr lyon and all of the shadow rapporteurs for their work .
i imagine that new resources would be needed for this .
these relations must be mutually beneficial and contribute to reciprocal development and the principle of non - interference and respect for national sovereignty must be observed .
i should like to ask the council if it could explain in its reply the route map towards achieving a common energy policy in the eu , giving the timescale .
so what if the committee of ministers of the council of europe is called upon to monitor enforcement of the court 's judgments ?
we received good news last week with the successful sale of portuguese , spanish and italian bonds , and we saw reductions in the spreads for belgium and other countries .

a large portion of the funds was allocated to energy projects , but considerable financing is still required for decommissioning and national funds are not sufficient to cover this : the state ignalina nuclear power plant decommissioning fund has failed to accumulate sufficient funds .
it is vital for the european union to play its part in devising appropriate responses and to demonstrate unity in its measures for dealing with the consequences , not only with a focus on the poorest sectors of the eu population , but also in developing countries .
there is a need for change here , particularly in the council .
among the current 35 romanian meps , 12 are women .
i would like to comment on the situation in japan .
mr president , this oral amendment is intended to make the text more precise and up to date .
( de ) mr president , we in the group of the greens / european free alliance want to see strong european economic governance .
this country is in a really very serious situation , in which human rights and the chance to oppose a dictatorial government must get the european union interested ...
there has been progress in all three areas .
the very concept of this proposal is alien to many judicial systems within member states , especially those who have a legal system based on common law .
belgium is about to fall to bits and the rest will follow .
it is for this reason that we must indeed implement and apply the think small first principle , which consists of considering the interests of smes in all union legislation .
will we continue to have 27 simultaneously existing decisions , or does the commission already have other proposals , and to what extent will the airlines be involved here ?
thirdly , minority rights .
i can inform you that the european union welcomes the resumption of the dialogue between the envoys of the dalai lama and the chinese government , which was restarted again in september 2002 .
this triangle needs to be an isosceles triangle .
the proposal to mobilise the fund to help great britain and northern ireland , which were afflicted by flooding in june and july 2007 , meets all the formal requirements .
what is sauce for the goose is une for the gander , as they say .
certainly , this new challenge will involve costs and inefficiencies that are difficult to justify unless , as i have already said in previous interventions , we make necessary and courageous choices such as the return to nuclear power .
we need , particularly in times of crisis , a representative voice to speak on behalf of the eu .
in order to plan and implement a development course which will help to balance the relationship between man and nature and satisfy grassroots needs , we need , in the final analysis , to overturn capitalist relations of production .
on behalf of the uen group . - mr president , with your permission , i would like to start my speech in irish .
anything else would be counterproductive .
this is about - and i quote - ' air emissions and environmental taxes ' , just as the last speaker said .
in writing . - i cannot but welcome the commission proposal for a partnership on the fight against cancer , which is a serious public health concern in the eu .
a year ago , parliament endorsed my proposal to start these negotiations as quickly as possible .
without business and without industry we cannot conceive of protecting jobs , or of safeguarding the right to work of our fellow citizens .
as was the case during the various wars which marked the break - up of the former yugoslavia , the evil is attributed to only one side and repentance is demanded from only one camp .
i believe that the fact that someone here in parliament who supports serbia has condemned the eulex mission is simply grotesque .
reducing greenhouse gas emissions , making more use of green energy , and more economical energy management , all provide opportunities to reduce the extent to which we rely on imported gas and oil .
( cs ) mr president , i would like to comment on mr tabajdi 's report on sustainable agriculture and biogas .
another proposal is the need for real partnership , based on dialogue and consultations , in which support for democracy is treated as a separate topic and in which various dialogues are more coherent and coordinated .
i said this at the time when my appointment was approved by parliament .
in gaza , hamas has created a terrorist fiefdom : it tolerates no opposition to its views , it has murdered those palestinians who opposed it , it has split the palestine authority , it refused to stop terror attacks on israeli civilians , it refused to recognise the right of israel to exist , it refused to acknowledge the peace agreements previously negotiated .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , economic policy coordination , growth , employment , innovation , social inclusion : those are the slogans of the new 2020 strategy , that is , the one which , after the lisbon strategy , is supposed to guide europe towards the end of the crisis that is weakening europeans ' spending power and spirits .
despite the declarations which have been made , both in the eastern partnership and the black sea synergy programmes , construction of the nabucco gas pipeline , which is to connect deposits in asia with users in europe , continues to be postponed .
it should provide incentives to renew fleets and create more efficient , more modern aircraft .
the commission proposal suggests a maximum emission target of 120 grams of co 2 in 2012 , which was retabled as an amendment .
the current portuguese presidency is even aiming to strengthen european relations with africa in this context .
perhaps those who are more vulnerable , namely employees who have lost their jobs , are once again at a loss as to what they are being punished for .
this anti - grassroots eu policy also bears the hallmark of the pasok and new democracy parties , which continue to support the choices of capital , while shifting the consequences of the crisis on to the workers ' shoulders .
if they are not allowed to annex to albania , they want true independence .
an appropriate balance has to be found between maintaining national social security traditions , which are important in each of our member states , and making the changes which are vital for facilitating cross - border mobility .
i cannot believe that anyone in this house believes that a right to privacy is a right to evade tax .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , here in the european parliament , we have been debating the services directive for a long time , and we have expressed many concerns in our debates about how it should be implemented and how we can ensure that service providers have free movement within the european union .
turkey would help spread stability in the volatile regions beyond its eastern and southern borders .
rather , we need to demand implementation and a review and to be realistic so that the standards we have established are also put into practice .
i would like to stress three points .
allow me to recall once again that , if this directive is applied to the trans - european network , it will save more than 600 lives and prevent around 7 000 accidents every year .
all actors operating in this field will have to take note of that .
secondly , if we returned to the drachma without abolishing the euro area and the euro , there would be no legal facility for automatically converting deposits in euros in greek banks , both inside and outside greece , to drachmas without the depositor 's consent .
it is between 21 % and 30 % , therefore clearly above the 15 % for appendix 1 of the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora ( cites ) .
at present we are seeing time and again in greece , portugal and ireland that , under pressure from the european commission , in negotiations with the national governments results and packages have been put together in which it is the weakest that suffer , and in which the wealthy - who did very well out of the previous 20 years - are left alone .
do you see a need to modify the television directive based on the new technical regulations ?
to the supervisory authority the ce marking is the only indication as to whether conformity , that is to say de facto safety , has been assessed .
as you very well know , it is a strategy which is intended to bring our citizens work , prosperity and stability throughout the union for a whole decade .
it was worth the effort .
on friday , the ministers from france , the czech republic and sweden adopted a plan of action .
i would therefore like to highlight the urgent need to support growth through investment in knowledge - based economic sectors .
if you look through your interventions , you will see that there is a considerable convergence in the goals we would like to achieve together .
the member states must be able to decide how many migrants with sound qualifications are needed and to set to work in their countries without causing a brain drain in sensitive sectors , such as health care , in the third countries .
through this report , the european union is inviting the european spring council to give a strong political impetus and draw up a roadmap for all the legal initiatives in order to guarantee , along with parliament , that they will be adopted in good time .
this is more effective than broader sanctions in the form of general trade embargoes or other more arbitrary measures .
whether the reform package and reform laws will actually be implemented in practice remains to be seen .
it will take extensive initiatives from the european commission to correct this situation , and it is therefore necessary for the european commission to be informed in its work in a qualified and detailed way , both by member states and by the private sector .
the objective of the impact and sustainable development assessment was to analyse the economic , social and environmental impact of the future free trade agreement and to identify any necessary support measures .
this issue will not be discussed at this summit , but we will discuss enlargement later in the autumn , with a possible decision being taken in december .
there is a sea change under way in the arab world .
i can in no way agree that the natural environment in europe can be made slave to eu external energy policy , when in recent years europe has spoken out forcefully for environmental protection .
the whole thrust of cap reform now is to give support to farmers for environmental reasons , but also very much to push them in the direction of producing for the market place .
it undermines the fundamental rights of our people and the foundations of our democracy .
go to the places where freedoms are ignored , human rights are restricted , and there is still war and conflict .
mr president , commissioner ferrero - waldner spoke of the importance of getting the relationship between the eu and russia right .
no amendments .
in principle , financial support to help member states in further building up national capacities to implement improvements and create new tools for statistical data collection should be included .
therefore , i think we will need to consider how best to proceed but , given the nature of this assistance , i think we have to reflect very carefully on that .
that should not be allowed .
they recommend that immunity be lifted , although mr vanhecke is not the author of the controversial text , and the belgian constitution clearly stipulates that only the author can be prosecuted if known .
at the same time , i agree with my fellow members who say that the court of auditors ' report contains not only positive points , but also downright appalling and alarming ones .
as you well know , under community legislation , every request for asylum or residence must be examined in the member state first entered by the applicant , regardless of his or her actual destination .
in germany , i feel that i have been provided with sufficient information on how i should behave .
i voted in favour of this report as the rules of procedure of the court of first instance lack any provision as to the language required to be used in appeal proceedings ( against decisions of the civil service tribunal ) .
this directive will not only help boost efficiency in this area relating to the recovery of claims , but will also help the single market operate better .
it seems to me that our position and our targets really do set the pace in terms of the changes needed in order to pre - empt ecological disaster .
in low - income countries the fact that testing is voluntary is a serious obstacle to combating the aids pandemic .
thank you for your attention .
the problem being dealt with today is essentially an administrative matter , a matter related to internal order in venezuela , a matter which is being resolved and what is more , has even been resolved according to information we have .
all of us in this chamber have the political responsibility to make this happen .
she has always indicated her support for improving consumer confidence .
this is unacceptable .
i understand that the rationale behind this suggestion was not to achieve such an outcome , but believe that this would actually restrict patients ' rights as defined by the court .
the approach outlined in the recommendation has proved to be a step in the right direction , especially during the economic crisis .
i believe we have succeeded in rounding off the procedure or system in those areas where certain issues were missing , such as getting subsequent administrative offences once the information has been exchanged and notification made .
once again , i would stress the absolute need for consistency between internal and external processes , as you have already mentioned , mrs reding .
i also call on the commission to take concrete action and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against roma in europe .
25 .
anyway , thank you and we will undoubtedly speak about this again .
i feel that , very often , that economic role is ignored , and we do not talk about it ; we do not even think about it , and we relegate culture to second - class status .
today three quarters of all rice consumed in haiti is imported from the usa .
the strategic partnership with brazil is a decision in favour of brazil and in favour of mercosur .
madam president , this is essentially an issue that concerns not only smes , but all enterprises facing this kind of competition .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
i believe that the commission has done a great deal towards achieving these objectives .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , we are looking at the progress that the european union has made towards becoming this area of freedom , security and justice .
i hope in the next four weeks , in this campaign , that the voters of europe can see the real face of this project .
i believe we must all remind course providers that they can obtain funding for their proposed courses from the european social fund , for example , or from any of the structural funds .
this is excellent news , but it is mainly by focusing on these structural causes that the commission will show that it has grasped the extent of the crisis and that it recognises that both it and the eu are fully accountable for what happens today .
they suddenly left .
that being said , we felt obliged not to vote on the regulation itself .
technical and economic developments alone make this an absolute necessity .
this question , jan andersson , is about social europe .
these are undue administrative interference , insufficient respect for the freedom of expression and access of all parties to media , and an overall lack of public confidence in the democratic and electoral process .
as a polish woman , i would also like to emphasise our solidarity with third country citizens legally residing in the european union .
we are all responsible for the delays in achieving the millennium development goals , which makes coordinated action by the eu and the un a matter of urgency .
in committee we have therefore already put a stop to further wishful thinking , as a member state which receives funds for its workers should already be aware of its responsibilities .
i would like to thank president barroso for his particular contribution to getting the nabucco project off the ground .
in writing . - ( bg ) the lack of suitable instruments for diagnosing public finance problems early , along with the poorly operating mechanisms of the stability and growth pact , are among the basic causes of the long - running crisis which the euro area and eu are going through .
in writing . - a good report where , among other things , parliament welcomes the fact that the agenda of the 16th regular session includes reports on the ' rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ' , and on the ' promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism ' , as well as extensive meetings on the rights of the child ; welcomes also this year 's nominations of special rapporteurs on these key topics , and takes note of the reports to be presented by the special rapporteurs on torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , on freedom of religion or belief , and on the situation of human rights defenders ; calls on the eu member states to contribute actively to these debates .
the ' blue card ' offers an opportunity for migrants to settle with their families and work in our countries .
the next item is question time ( b 7-0407/2011 ) .
we therefore continuously encourage this dialogue and this search for a solution .
they actively opposed a requirement that product labels must show that pesticides used as preservatives are included , so that the consumers would be aware of the fact .
this is a good balance between intellectual property rights and the rights of consumers .
we are all aware that the current model of soft law imposes the requirement to undertake transposition into the national systems .
firstly , a horizontal directive on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings , which will , for example , clearly establish the following enforceable rights : easily accessible victim support services in all member states ; the right to interpretation during interviews ; a minimising of contact between the offender and the victim during proceedings , with any new courts to be designed so as to provide separate waiting areas ; and the right in all member states to request a review of the prosecution .
one of the fundamental features of the revolutions in central europe in 1989 was the ability immediately to create genuine organisations to represent the democratic , secular revolutionary forces .
after the vote :
it should , however , be stressed - as you have done - that this measure will have to be approached in a realistic and pragmatic way .
subject : measures to promote family - friendly policies
in 2006 , the acknowledged needs of the new member states made it necessary to revise the directive .
it is making a laughing stock of france by organising anti - french demonstrations in paris because it was upset by french protests about the mistreatment of the people of tibet , which it continues to oppress .
10 .
the acp - eu joint parliamentary assembly is a unique institution that has succeeded in establishing itself as a key player in european - african relations and in north - south relations .
that is another task for the commission .
i once again urge my fellow members to avoid any political games when voting on the amendments and to make sure there is a large absolute majority for this report on turkey to be adopted in plenary .
i do not believe that we can any longer accept the continuation of this transitional system .
rising fuel prices were also discussed last week by the g 8 finance ministers representing the most developed countries .
some time ago , you announced that they were going to set up a kind of chinese rapex system .
only the partner countries are in a position to force us to provide more effective aid by actively defining not only their development objectives but also the means of achieving them .
in writing . - the eu as a bloc is the world 's largest contributor of humanitarian aid .
trade policy cannot ignore any failure to respect workers ' rights and therefore , the development of society may continue only after these drawbacks are removed .
let me say again : let us think before we act .
yesterday the danish parliament refused a referendum on a treaty they have not read .
instead of talking about symptoms , it is time to get serious about the disease : the fact that we have used all the easy oil and are still addicted to the stuff .
( applause )
on the borders , no answer and continuing generic waffle about enlargement , without raising the geopolitical problem of europe 's borders which , for us , is the key issue .
how can you think that the standards of the osce and council of europe are too high for the european union ?
i think that we should take far - reaching steps to defeat these diseases of civilisation .
in the meantime , we need to work on the remaining trade and economic problems , for example , the siberian overflight fees , measures at the border that hamper the importation of commercial vehicles into russia , the discriminatory road taxes , plans to limit the import of containers by road , export duties on timber and the protectionist measures russia has recently taken .
on top of this , they have an essential role in combating climate change due to their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen .
in accordance with this code , the union started making annual reports that are actually reports on completed arms transfers .
europe must not hide when it is needed most .
from the perspective of our long - term energy security , nuclear energy is the solution that can guarantee a sufficient amount of energy with the lowest levels of carbon dioxide emissions and , therefore , we must place great emphasis on the related question of the safe storage and production of fuel .
a review of support tools is also appropriate in the context of an economic crisis that has had a particularly virulent effect on smes , as eloquently documented by the loss of 3 250 000 jobs between 2009 and 2010 alone ( more than a third of the new jobs that this sector had created ) .
( it ) mr president , commissioner , this agreement contains a clause that does not convince us and has never convinced us .
they also have problems of the first magnitude and i would like us not to transform what is a legitimate reflection on how to run major advanced economies better into a criticism of the euro which , as i said , has delivered exactly in line with what was expected .
it seems that the council has either completely or partially failed to grasp the fact that improving quality and ensuring greater consistency and solidarity is not only in the interests of the asylum seeker , but also in the interests of the member states themselves .
thank you for listening .
decisions concerning certain documents : see minutes
as you can appreciate , i have been quite flexible about the timing , partly because all the speeches have been very agreeable as well as very powerful - the imf , casinos and cholesterol - all great fuel for this discussion .
here we have reached some important milestones .
first , there are tremendously dedicated people there doing the work to try to help the haitians , and second , the haitian people are a very proud people and we should recognise that at the beginning of this debate .
forest cover is not only affected by forest policies , but also by other policies such as taxation policy , land tenure and rights .
recent earthquake in haiti ( motions for resolutions tabled ) : see minutes
freedom of movement between the two continents has thus become urgency and should constitute a priority topic already at the prague meeting on 5th april 2009 .
this scheme will allow householders who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments to defer all their principal and up to 70 % of their interest payments for a period of two years .
between the countries that are fearful of the effects of independence and those who dream only of validating their independence as soon as possible for various diplomatic reasons , slovenia will initially have to ensure the cohesion of the union by seeking first and foremost an internal compromise , if the eu 's foreign policy as laid down in the treaty of lisbon is not to be trivialised or even ridiculed .
well , this is what we have done here .
that is the kind of certainty citizens need .
the same can be said about the next 50 years .
unfortunately , none of these amendments were adopted , and i therefore voted against the report .
we need a general agreement which provides a coherent and legally binding framework in order to protect personal data and to enforce the rights of individuals .
the vote will take place on wednesday .
secondly , who would benefit from this ?
firstly , the common position introduces a provision which allows member states to regulate or prohibit strictly for reasons other than safety during transport the transport of dangerous goods within their territory .
the eu should be deeply concerned for the resolution of the israeli - palestinian conflict which , in addition to the victims it has caused , has , for decades , created great instability in the region and in the world .
i would like to assure them that the commission is giving careful consideration to the question of eib regulatory supervision .
we are opposed to the fact that the report contains a number of aspects which have nothing to do with trade policy .
in writing . - i support this report , which calls for the eu to promote the introduction of a financial transaction tax ( ftt ) at global level , and failing that , as a first step , the eu should implement an ftt at european level .
we have a very responsible commissioner , a compatriot of yours , andris piebalgs , who acquitted himself admirably last week and during the gas dispute with russia and ukraine , but especially with russia .
i think these are the major points that i would like to make at this stage , but i am sure we can come back to this topic again , maybe after the meetings have taken place .
national declarations and the participation of member states need a stronger legal basis .
in this regard , i can but fully endorse what mr barroso had to say .
once again , i wish you complete success in your presidency .
amendment of regulation ( euratom , ecsc , eec ) no 549/69 determining the categories of officials and other servants of the european communities to whom the provisions of article 12 , the second paragraph of article 13 and article 14 of the protocol on the privileges and immunities of the communities apply (
i am afraid the wrong light came on when i pressed the button .
the ombudsman produces an annual activity report .
mr president , honourable members , i would like to reflect briefly on two trains of thought .
this is a time for brave decisions at national level , with a long - term view and without cutting any corners .
however , i would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the issue of the health and safety of workers employed in the construction sector .
the europe we see now is the exact opposite of anything related to democracy .
i would like to start by thanking you all for a fascinating debate , for many interesting ideas , and for the enthusiasm and support you are showing for the eu 2020 strategy .
this is why it is important that we put as much money as possible into aid for areas affected by the natura 2000 programme .
the various european commissioners involved will need to coordinate their approach so as to put an end to any action that excludes or discriminates against roma people .
however , i very much doubt whether the proposition to regulate scores of airports throughout the eu is going to produce the utopia in airport charges that the airlines and the commission want .
there was one main weakness , however , in that proposal , which is that there was no provision for the selling off of tyres that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date .
it is also pursuing convergence objectives ( despite the damaging changes in this field since the last enlargement ) .
anyone who has never lived under communism cannot understand how much a person 's life and way of thinking can be affected by a totalitarian system .
this would go on to form part of the conclusions of the presidency of the edinburgh european council , which took place in december 1992 .
i also welcome the important achievement that the principles of the treaty , in particular transparency , non - discrimination and openness , will also be implemented in the defence and security market and , as has already been said , this will result in an improvement of the efficiency of defence spending .
such situations , which are happening at an alarming rate , require decision makers to think carefully about the european economic and social model as well as its sustainability and its future .
the eur 30 000 to eur 60 000 increase of de minimis aid for companies for a period of only three years can help them in this complicated situation .
it is very disturbing to see how particular countries have so easily allowed russia to manipulate them .
however , on the other hand , there have , in fact , already been very many such debates here , and we are very good at talking .
in the case of a nurse or an it specialist , this is not needed to enable them to play a useful role in our companies .
the report has discussed that at length , so i shall not say any more about it here .
we have many concerns about the target , which was to halve the number of victims by 2010 .
in fact , regardless of which of these groups we find ourselves in today , we will all be held accountable for the future fate of the nations of europe .
if we fail to regulate that properly , then i will no longer have any desire to work on the other sub - initiatives .
what does the council intend to do to prevent speculation on portuguese public debt ?
the next item is the statements by the council and the commission on preparation for the european council meeting of 4 february 2011 .
in writing . - ( pt ) the toy safety directive represents an extremely important step towards ensuring our children 's safety .
i think it is widely accepted now that we must have a sustainable biofuels strategy and , if we do not get it , then we have to look again at the targets we have set .
( cs ) ladies and gentlemen , world intellectual property organisation figures clearly show that europe 's problem is not a lack of new ideas ; what is missing is their transformation into business opportunities .
lapsed written declarations : see minutes
european politicians should not be supporting the dictatorship of globalism , but be dealing with the real issues : how to eradicate unemployment , halt mass immigration , and have the discriminatory and inhumane beneš decrees and the slovak language law repealed . i also call on every colleague and fellow member to support the aspirations for autonomy of the largest disenfranchised minority in europe , the hungarians living outside hungary 's borders .
( applause )
concerning the third issue of tracking systems to locate containers at sea , this possibility could be further explored .
if the eu is to have credibility as a global power it needs to put its money where its mouth is .
claude turmes , you will secure a very substantial majority in favour of this report tomorrow and i would like to congratulate you here and now on that achievement .
but i am afraid , here on this occasion , that compromise has not been reached : in fact , we have heard some comments from his colleagues that suggest that some of his own group members , those with a more developed social conscience , are squirming and feeling rather uncomfortable with the approach that has been taken by the rapporteur .
we want more clarity ; in other words , we want to reduce the lack of clarity in the law so as to ensure the unhindered application of the principles contained in the european union 's treaties , and we want to honour the international agreements that we have concluded .
our system of social care is also far from perfect .
as we are aware of the need to cut red tape and eliminate disparities between countries , we will indicate specific measures - such as setting up one - stop shops and the use of e-government - to try to speed up processes in this area .
there is that , and there is also the treaty of nice , and a parliament with fewer seats and fewer powers , and a commission with fewer commissioners .
it is hardly mentioned in this document .
yes , mr dalli , you will have our support , but we experience that unease born of the risk associated with the distribution of competences between yourselves .
it appears that the world of crazy finance has not learnt from the crisis .
i welcome the clarity of this report also because it mentions matters which we generally avoid discussing for a variety of reasons .
this part underlines the key role of education , training , research and innovation , the importance of facilitating the establishment of the so - called knowledge triangle , and the need to support small and medium - sized enterprises , which quite often play a pioneering role in innovation .
we all know that there are some governments who are undermining the whole schengen system through the mass regularisation of illegal aliens .
in closing i would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their extremely pleasant and constructive cooperation on this report .
in this context , special attention must obviously be focused as well on the security of the travel documents issued by the third countries in question .
i therefore repeat with conviction that i fully support the directive .
as such , this regulation makes an important contribution towards better air quality , and hence to improving public health .
i call upon all eu institutions to avoid further delay in deciding on the macro - financial assistance for the republic of moldova .
the new cap must enable people to enjoy an adequate supply of quality food , as well as being able to sustain the production of non - marketable public assets .
i truly hope that the writing of history and commemoration of the victims is the main focus in ukraine and that this catastrophe is not manipulated for political purposes .
most of these farms can use the sustainable model of agriculture for the good of farmers , the environment and of us all .
online gambling accounts for just around 5 % of all the takings from gambling , but the sector is growing at an enormous rate .
in our democratic national systems , each time that there is a political discussion , even sometimes one that is very polarised , we do not call into question the very legitimacy of the state , while very often in europe when those of us who are for europe strongly express these objections , we have to confront those who are against europe and who explore all sorts of populisms in order to damage our institutions and compromise this great project of peace and solidarity that is the european project .
( fr ) madam president , firstly i should like to commend the swedish presidency 's efforts to reach an ambitious agreement in copenhagen , despite the very strong wind of pessimism prevailing over these forthcoming negotiations .
but what can westminster do as long as we are in the eu , because at exactly the same time , the european commission wants all the powers over asylum seekers passed to them ?
these savings must benefit the new intermediary regions of course , but also the other regions .
this is not an emergency aid solidarity fund ; it is a fund which is based on reimbursement of specific costs for emergency operations after disasters , allowing for a return to normal living conditions .
yes it did .
however , europe has suffered from something else too .
with a view to cap reform after 2013 , it will be necessary to tackle the matter with commitment and come up with measures necessary for limiting the impact of price volatility in the agricultural sector once and for all .
one thing is clear , however : this europe will only be a good europe if it is a democratic one .
for this reason , we place special emphasis on prevention ; this explains our day for the eradication of poverty on 17 october , as mrs záborská has pointed out .
by september our fuel provision to the gaza strip had surpassed 90 million litres .
this is our moral obligation .
the commission is financing csfp joint actions establishing planning teams in pristina .
in greece , we are calling for the establishment of a centre for romani and gypsy studies , with special emphasis on culture .
the commission certainly supports the country 's commitment to the consolidation of peace , stability and , above all , democracy .
to this end , we must fully utilise the technical means available to us in all bands to achieve the greatest possible efficiency .
i want to say that , in relation to the future , your comments are particularly welcome .
developing countries must be supported to give them enough political room to manoeuvre so that speculation can be prevented and financial stability can be secured .
madam president , i would like to point out that this is , of course , a worker - protection issue .
my own position remains unchanged : recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia are comparable , under international law , with recognition of kosovo .
14 .
therefore , the way in which we pursue our energy policy and how we deal with those who we expect to invest in the projects is important .
the member states should not always shift responsibility to the commission but should also be prepared to take their own decisions .
member of the commission . - do you mean these three questions on the ccctb ?
moreover , in exceptional cases , where this is specifically provided , this will be extended for a further12 months .
in writing . - the abolition of the death penalty worldwide is a priority of this parliament and a particular priority of the socialists and democrats group .
thus , there are technical specifications for energy efficiency and environmental performance .
i am just thinking about the debate on the professional qualifications directive , which we later also combined in a single instrument because this fragmentation was no longer manageable .
i hope that we will get the support of tomorrow 's plenary for our motion today and , above all , that it will encourage the commission to get to work on this issue .
rather , it is the best possible result today , as it fills a void and opens the way for further developments .
in writing . - ( sv ) the report 's starting point is increased interinstitutional cooperation by means of a general increase in services within the eu 's institutions .
legislation on gender equality is harmonised , but greater effort needs to be made to implement it in order to reduce the differences between men and women in terms of their participation in the labour market , politics and the decision - making process , as well as with regard to access to education .
early diagnosis and research provide a solid foundation for health protection .
it harms the dutch economy and dutch citizens .

however , we also failed much closer to home , in our own territory .
the problem , which is starting to cause serious difficulties , lies in the imposition of a congestion charge .
we , the european parliament , other eu institutions , the member states have to understand that unless we care about young people today , it may be that none of our other strategies , including eu 2020 , are ever implemented , as there will not be anybody left to implement them .
as legislators confronted with that global backdrop , we need to do something .
it is therefore necessary for the statutory conditions for the industry to be cleared up as soon as possible .
i would also like to highlight the recognition given to traditional agriculture , particularly organic and small - scale farming , which exists in the more disadvantaged regions , and which represents not only an economic asset but , above all , an environmental asset , as it is essential for preserving biodiversity .
this is a de facto and de jure situation .
for example , it would make it easier for us to cooperate effectively in general terms if russia implemented higher data protection standards ; research , education and culture also provide numerous opportunities for cooperation in the interests of our citizens , and should be taken into consideration in the new agreement .
i would add greece ; you all know the problems it is facing .
the eu - us aviation markets , taken together , account for about 60 % of world air traffic .
this relates to special aid for establishing the public administration , strengthening civil society and for educational projects .
i think the simpson report will be particularly popular due to the notion of tourism satellite accounts , namely , the adoption of pilot projects that will make it possible to assess the economic impact on individual sectors of the economy , in other words , aspects relating to same - day visits , the evaluation report to be drawn up every five years and the possibility , indeed the necessity , of a five - yearly report to assess the effects of statistics .
our response to this phenomenon through the european union 's solidarity fund provides important support in the task of rebuilding the areas affected by disasters , along with reducing their potential cross - border effects .
it has often been said in the past that the strategy of cooperation that characterised the lisbon strategy failed .
ec - pacific states interim partnership agreement ( vote )
however , parliament is also passing up an opportunity with the garriga polledo report .
they have to export their goods .

the international community , and above all the european union , must force israel and the palestinians to reach an amicable settlement .
russia is planning to build two new nuclear power plants even closer to the european union 's borders in belarus and kaliningrad .
only then will we be able to reduce the need for resources and the amount of items going to landfill .
a draft recommendation constitutes a finding of maladministration by the ombudsman .
this is a disgrace .
in writing . - ( fr ) i welcome the adoption of this report , which presents a balanced and realistic view of the issue of immigration and has achieved a broad consensus , as the rapporteur hoped .
the social and political changes that have taken place in montenegro in recent years are a positive sign not only for the eu , but also for the country 's neighbours .
although it is , in principle , to be welcomed that the european union is considering how it can support the efforts of member states to provide adequate pensions , pensions policy is , and remains , the task of the relevant member states , in respect of which the eu should only take action with the utmost sensitivity and with consideration for national circumstances .
he may be a nice chap who donates a lot of that money to good causes , but if we were to use open software more bravely in this house , it would be a step towards cleaner , cheaper and modern management .
we cannot return to the old ways of doing things .
many sports are subsidised from the profits of state - run lotteries as well as licensed gambling .
my most important point is the issue of the 12 - day rule .
the vote will take place on thursday , 19 june 2008 .
in this case , i feel that the crisis in campania offers an important lesson on waste management to all europeans , including lithuanians .
by adopting this resolution , the european parliament is openly supporting transparent funding , which is a fundamental element of democratic values and good governance .
why did the commission and its services not react earlier in the case of greece or ireland ?
we are talking here about the european social model that we want and that we love .
if we want to change that rule , then that is fine .
oral explanations of vote
the green new deal has now become a concept , and one that receives our wholehearted support .
i mean , hands up those of us who fell for endowment mortgages ?
the latter were particularly interested in the method of financing and even more so in the public procurement contracts related to the galileo programme .
it is therefore clear that this event does not make a symbolic contribution but a legal contribution .
in subsequent budgetary policy i think that parliament should ensure that the priorities are that the eu is able to increase its own contribution , that the budget supports material efficiency and policy on climate change through its own choice of policies , and that in this way the europe 2020 strategy and a greener economy are achieved .
mr president , i welcome ms ferreira 's excellent work and cooperation , thanks to which we have before us a report that gives a comprehensive and honest appraisal of the potential and limitations of market - based instruments .
preparation for the summit is therefore proceeding .
the amount paid by the european taxpayer should be exclusively used for development objectives , that is to say that it should be spent for the benefit of the fishing communities , so as to enhance their living conditions , to provide training programmes , to ensure safety at sea and to create new local jobs .
so far , we have only achieved an increase in efficiency in the external action service of 1 % , whereas the target is 10 % .
all credit to her .
one aspect of this report in particular which interested me is the position of the new member states , but not very much information is provided in this area .
consequently , parliament must make it very clear today that we are talking about the citizens of europe , irrespective of the member state concerned .
the report is in favour of approving the conclusion of this agreement on visa exemption as soon as possible , in order that all eu citizens , including citizens of estonia , latvia , malta and cyprus , can travel to brazil for tourism and business purposes , just as brazilian citizens can already travel without a visa to all eu member states .
i should emphasis that we have sought to ensure coherence and consistency in this report and this regulation with the other parts of the package .
i participated in a workshop on consumer protection data breach notification , which is about to be discussed in parliament as part of european legislation .
mr president , i would like to continue the topic raised by my colleague , thomas mann , about moving intergroup meetings to thursday afternoons .
he received this prize for the defence of freedoms we share across this parliament .
finally , it is very important to ensure recognition of the right of female and male workers to take part in restructuring processes affecting industrial undertakings , by guaranteeing their structures , in particular the european works councils , full access to information and the possibility of decisive intervention , including the right of veto .
yes , his party won as many seats as the liberal democrats in the last european elections in the uk , having outspent them , i think , by a factor of 10 - mr duff is nodding , so i suppose that is right .
this is evidence of the need to address the issues relating to regional policy and cohesion policy in detail in this house .
the rule of law and respect for human rights and the fundamental freedoms are fundamental principles for cooperation within the european union .
parliament 's committee on economic and monetary affairs voted a few days ago for the package on the supervision of financial activities .
the reports about the tragedies unfolding at our external borders are as plain as day .
we have therefore decided to abstain on this report .
we are in favour of the free movement of workers and of ensuring that the member states comply with the directive .
indeed , science , education and innovation are the foundations for economic revitalisation and the creation of new jobs .
all of the information presented for this option and which formed the basis for my own decision indicates that the criteria set out in article 283(2 ) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union have been met , and show that there is a need for the ecb to be fully independent , in accordance with article 130 of that treaty , and i therefore welcome the appointment of mr praet .
i would like to point out that the resources invested from 2000 to 2006 by way of the european regional development fund have enabled the creation of 1 400 000 jobs in the european union , as well as the building of over 2 000 km of motorways .
firstly , a european union diplomatic service , not an inter - governmental service , and this means an assurance that 60 % of posts will be appointed by the european union .
another waste of money : how many billions is this house of history going to cost , to sell propaganda and tell how the european union ' saved the world ' ?
in this regard , i welcome improving relations with regional organisations .
concerning the question to the commission on the implementation of the eu - russia visa facilitation agreement that i tabled on behalf of the alde group , i wanted to learn what progress has been made so far and whether we are , at the moment , in a position to expect a breakthrough in tackling technical questions such as the requirement for eu citizens to register with the authorities within three days if staying in a private home in russia .
i voted in favour of mrs paliadeli 's report as i believe it presents a complete , detailed overview of what the european ombudsman does in terms of handling and resolving citizens ' complaints .
surveillance of fiscal policies is at the heart of emu , and i must also include surveillance of structural reforms and implementation of structural reforms , and surveillance of the evolution of the cost competitiveness of the various economies , particularly , members of the euro area .
that is an important piece of legislation . we need to see it implemented .
where the logic is in that final option i just do not know .
while i do think it is vitally important to step up the control of timber imports at the borders of the single market , i feel that the report proposes too onerous and bureaucratic a system , which will penalise our own european forestry sectors .
we do not understand how this mission can contribute to state - building .
my fear is that , if we lose the opt - out , we will force more people into the grey economy and then they will not be covered by health and safety legislation , in particular the dangerous machinery directive .
on behalf of the uen group . - ( pl ) madam president , 50 years of experience in european schools that are faced with the specific problem of different languages , cultural diversity and migration makes one consider whether this experience should be used to make this school model more widely available .
the data supplied today by iata are worrying .
at a time when the ageing of the population is continuing , the birth rate is getting lower and demographic disparities are prevalent , these policies must identify specific measures for countering the impact caused .
given europe 's cultural diversity , some of these practices , which are alien to the eu 's respect for animal welfare , have begun to take root .
( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i gave a definite ' no ' to a document further impaired by the adoption of various amendments which have made it worse , and in particular because of the introduction of sugaring which we had managed to stave off for years , taking the view that sugaring is no more than a way of making up for nature .
i believe this must be active through the second pillar of the cap.
thirdly : after adopting the strategy on the rights of the child in january , parliament cannot now take a step backwards and lock up children or treat them as proposed .
it has no democratic legitimacy .
i am not a chávez follower .
i would like to use this opportunity to call on the commission and council to make every effort for the eu to strengthen its cooperation with the other states in the horn of africa in order to prevent occurrences of piracy and to make transit journeys in the region safer .
in fact , consumers should benefit from every reduction in expenses and from every increase in the efficiency of the system .
enabling citizens to live longer certainly represents an achievement for the member states of the union .
the commission has taken account of parliament 's call .
the small number of special reports that the european ombudsman has had to present to parliament ( 17 since 1995 ) is proof of the cooperation that exists between the eu institutions in the vast majority of cases .
we have banks that are ' too big to fail ' , as the catchphrase goes .
membership of committees and delegations : see minutes
all the debates in plenary will be translated into all the languages .
if , therefore , we are now asking how to achieve stability or even growth in the volume of global trade , ladies and gentlemen , it can only be through effective measures for halting economic collapse , through measures for stabilising the economy and through the gradual start - up of economic growth .
( applause )
i have received five motions for resolutiontabled in accordance with rule 115(5 ) of the rules of procedure .
their resolve to seize what they saw as an opportunity was commendable .
the fourth element is regulating and preventing market volatility , which i believe is essential .
therefore , more favourable circumstances should be developed by strengthening the strategic partnership in the spirit of full mutual openness , transparency , complementarity and respect for the autonomy and institutional integrity of both organisations .
that is why we need the treaty of lisbon .
creating a separate eu constituency is an artificial way to try to create a european demos .
it is particularly this cause which the commission would like to address with the new cod recovery plan .
commissioner , you are now being asked to do something .
the commission does have a role to play on its own in this area .
( hu ) the proposal on maternity leave is inherently a health and safety provision , and the primary reason why the 1992 directive needs to be amended in terms of improving mothers ' living conditions is that the international labour organisation adopted an international convention in 2000 , setting the minimum length of maternity leave at 18 weeks .
time is therefore needed so that democratic forces - not the forces ' recognised ' by ben ali , but truly democratic forces - can develop .
11 .
the treaty of lisbon and also the europe 2020 strategy have de facto eliminated the poverty goals .
better lawmaking 2006 pursuant to article 9 of the protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality (
today , it is particularly important that we firmly condemn acts of aggression inspired by racist motivations , whoever the perpetrator is .
i am pleased with the compromise that has been found , so i voted in favour of this text .
and then the one that was supposed to be free is as follows : credit card fee : eur 12 ; taxes , fees and charges : eur 39.96 ; insurance : eur 14 .
in addition , the necessity of signing new agreements on economic partnership was the result of decisions made independently of the european union .
judge lee kang - kook and judge min hyung - ki made clear the need to limit the use of the death penalty and to reduce the number of crimes subject to capital punishment , while judge song doo - hwan argued that any decision on the death penalty should be the subject of a public debate and action by the legislature .
it is because civilisation and humanity are two of the many constituent principles of the european union ; they form part of the foundation of our treaties and i therefore believe that we must not merely take this matter as a starting point , but we must make it our serious business to consider what the eu 's attitude ought to be as a whole with regard to munitions of this type .
the roots of the instability , although linked to the drama in darfur , are also domestic and can only be overcome through internal political processes .
we cannot anticipate what funds will be available for the social fund but , certainly , we believe that we should have adequate ambition at the european instruments ' level .
i would like an explanation .
mr president , mr tremosa i balcells raised the issue of low - cost production in agriculture and it is an issue which i have huge concerns about , as do many others in this house .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as well as offering my condolences and support to the people of taiwan , i would like to emphasise the timeliness of the european union 's humanitarian effort in this disaster .
in reality , the exact opposite is the case .
we know that this measurement is very complex and can be manipulated , since fossil fuels , after extraction , are transported and processed , and their by - products distributed and used in many ways , at thousands of end points .
switzerland and sweden are already producing biomethane and using natural gas networks for its distribution .
( nl ) mr president , if we are to implement the employment chapter of the europe 2020 strategy , it is of the utmost importance that we make adjustments to the immigration policy of most member states and that of the eu .
for these reasons , i supported this report .
i should like to reaffirm that , mr posselt .
mr president , i wish to thank all the speakers and , in particular , to thank the rapporteurs once more .
minister , we are thinking of you !
we think that in principle , the commission 's proposal is positive , as to a certain extent it gives farmers the opportunity to take the initiative to renounce .
there are sites in the uk , belgium , poland , spain , germany and other european countries .
there are countries without any national room for manoeuvre , which are unable to resist the simultaneous and violent forces of the internal market , single currency and globalisation .
tuesday :
i can well understand president barroso thinking of his legacy , but we must not let his legacy damage european universities and research facilities .
i think i am right in saying that he is a prisoner who is both an israeli and a french citizen .
it is a process requiring adequate resources , but the commission is very closely cooperating with these authorities and carriers in this country to allow further positive developments .
on criteria that we ourselves decide , that our president is called upon to rule on , not the commission or the council ?
today 's vote concerned a request for assistance for 598 workers made redundant by eight companies operating in the nace revision 2 division 58 ( publishing activities ) in the two nuts ii regions of noord holland and zuid holland , amounting to a sum of eur 2 326 459 financed by the egf .
we need effective measures to adapt human society to new living conditions .
i am not saying ' no ' to measures at national level .
however , the situation is kafkaesque to put it mildly .
some time ago , this would have seemed an unlikely association .
europe 's duty in this regard is quite clear : it must harness all its resources and all its diplomatic skills to aid the transition and the organisation of democratic and open elections .
it is strange that today there is talk of turkey 's entry into europe , when belarus has a much stronger and more significant partnership role with europe .
so we have to raise awareness to promote the take - up of these ict goods and services which i believe will be one of the solutions to the problems of the ageing society .
have these problems also been sorted out in the meantime ?
if we manage to pull this off , then this is a precursor to my mind , and an important indicator that the horizontal instrument for consumer protection should be fully harmonised for all consumer purchases .
this should be the subject of serious consideration .
i will give my reasons for that .
it is highly unlikely that the human rights situation will improve under a president dmitry medvedev enthroned by putin .
the people of china liken this disaster to earlier cataclysms accompanying major historical changes in that country .
the objective of reducing pesticide use , and not only the dangers associated with it , has been added to the list of commitments to be met under the respective national plans only .
by contrast , china is well on course to beat us when it comes to energy efficiency and resource efficiency .
in any case , micro - enterprises will continue to keep their sales and transactions records for management and tax information purposes .
others would have voted ' no ' given the chance .
apart from the multilateral talks , an important way to overcome these barriers is through the leverage available to us in free trade agreement negotiations .
concerning the questions by mr kaczmarek and mr audy : the ultimate objectives of the scheme are indeed education and the eradication of poverty .
on one hand , its global values are low in comparison with the needs of the economic and social cohesion policies . on the other hand , the funds have not been spent , because the countries that were most in need of that money found it difficult to budget for the required cofinancing .
it is crucial for the member states , and therefore europe , to implement policies to ensure an abundant , secure supply .
of course , there were a few conflicts and i would like to mention some of these .
in that country , the united nations failed badly .
in developing a harmonised european pilot 's licence , the european aviation safety agency is about to wipe out the imc rating , leaving many private pilots unable to fly unless they can guarantee cloudless skies for the entirety of their trip .
in writing . - ( ro ) as a deputy elected in romania , i praise the approval of the european parliament 's draft resolution on the european union draft amending budget no. 1/2008 .
this is sufficient cause not to invite alexander lukashenko to the eu summit , in response to the appeals of the belarusian opposition .
also , if pension reforms are as essential as they are made out to be , which i personally do not believe they are , other examples of successful programmes could also be found .
finally , social protection for family carers is also important .
do we want to make it so expensive to borrow from a european bank that our customers , our corporates , just go and borrow from wall street and end up handing another coup to wall street at the expense of european banks ?
it therefore seems important to me that member states should be able , if necessary and in a proportionate and transparent fashion , to require the use of mandatory routes .
this is therefore , to my mind , the basis for the parliamentary legislative work we have carried out .
anyone violating it also violates international law - and that is something this house really cannot accept .
i am sure that the citizens of the european union , if well informed , will give the treaty their unqualified support .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( de ) mr president , i am speaking on behalf of my colleague who is unable to be here and i would like to make a few remarks .
it also needs to be said that when more and more changes take place in the markets and eu import protection decreases , administrative and regulatory mechanisms for the market will be needed in the future as well .
consequently , within the framework of the second strategic energy review , what can be called connecting the energy islands in the european union to the internal market has become one of the union 's key objectives .
contrary to what is claimed , it is necessary to reverse the route that the cap has been heading down , where successive reforms have dismantled the instruments to regulate the market , quotas and production rights , leading many thousands of producers to gradually abandon the sector .
( applause )
it was a patchwork of legislation and compliance which was , wittingly or unwittingly , different in the various locations and which sowed a seed of doubt in the minds of consumers when they considered buying timeshare property across the border .
what i cannot understand is the strategy .
in my view , a sufficient reduction in warming is possible only if we succeed in setting up a global market in carbon .
i should like to endorse the request that prime minister topolánek and the opposition leader mr paroubek sit down together and negotiate responsibly , because domestic policy problems cannot influence the fate of the whole of europe .
so we have shifted the burden of proof .
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , let us say this clearly : the way in which the negotiations on the anticounterfeiting trade agreement are being carried out is unacceptable to the european parliament .
the oft does not have jurisdiction to tackle any scams from elsewhere , including from other member states , so the problem continues and i continue to receive my share of complaints .
i accept that we want also to look very carefully at what we do ourselves and make sure that what we do is complementary and not duplicating other work .
on the other hand , however , we must give parliament the opportunity to fulfil all its duties and responsibilities which these same taxpayers have entrusted to it through the treaty of lisbon .
for example , can the additional investments be put in place in the same areas as the ispa projects ?
in such agreements , it is not the tightening - up of border controls into the union that should be the primary concern but monitoring the ratification of and compliance with the geneva convention .
that is why i will not tire of advocating economic , social and territorial cohesion at european level .
this report on the future of pensions in europe is , up to now , the only european institutional document which goes against the tide of the commission 's thinking - as represented in particular by its annual growth survey - and the thinking of the merkel - sarkozy duo in their document on the competitiveness pact .
the swiss being the swiss decided that they were better off by not joining or achieving full eu membership .
the current situation is therefore our most powerful ally , but it could also be our most fearsome adversary .
our group would like to see an end to this institutional debate and we are confident that the french presidency will work towards achieving this goal .
we know that the indirect benefits of the programme are estimated to be around eur 60 billion per year , but the commission has admitted that additional investment will be required in order to reach full operational capacity .
with regard to the eu entry / exit system , part of the data required to create this system was already collected by systems such as vis , sis and eurodac .
setting up the european external action service is the natural corollary of the process whereby the european union is acquiring more and more external competences .
you would be perfectly right if the amendment had not lapsed as a result of the previous vote .
energy efficiency will have a huge impact on economic growth , the methods used to cut co 2 emissions and on creating jobs in areas such as it , construction and services .
there have been repeated attempts to manipulate and distort the outcome of the election .
when we talk about tightening directives and regulations , we should always be well aware that a directive or regulation is only as effective as the instruments that ultimately verify its observance , in this case the market - surveillance mechanisms in the member states .
this is important when a cross - border criminal activity takes place .
if climate change is not dealt with , it will result in disasters all over the world .
in writing . - i voted in favour of the abovementioned report which includes an increase in loan commitments for programmes aiming at eradicating and tracking animal diseases as well as observing the physical well - being of animals which could present a threat to public health linked to external factors .
i voted in favour of this document , codifying council directive 86/298 / eec of 26 may 1986 on rear - mounted roll - over protection structures of narrow - track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors .
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , i thank you , but , in general , i hope that the commission considers that the time is right to re - examine the guidelines on vertical restraints that you mentioned just now , since they are in fact already about 10 years old .
they are helping to build poland .
montenegro still has a long way to go to attain membership of the eu , but remaining obstacles are being dismantled bit by bit .
in our bilateral dialogue with india - an eu - india summit is to be held - we may also discuss this issue of protected species and how we can better protect endangered species .
as i listened , i actually wrote the heading ' plan ' on a sheet of paper , where i intended to make notes of the information you would give us about what the eu was going to do .
lastly , i would like to point out that the council 's text largely takes account , on the one hand , of the freedom of expression clause in article 2 and on the other , of the proportionality clause in article 14 .
the vote will take place on tuesday , 9 february 2010 .
the same applies to cooperation with authorities in third countries .
i think he did a fantastic job because i understand that his interference actually helped the ' yes ' campaign .
i would also like a mid - term health check when it comes to the roadmap for gender equality , which contains a lot of nice words , but no regulation so far on the horizon .
the report condemns the approach adopted by the commission in making concessions on agriculture in order to obtain enhanced market access in third countries for industrial products and services .
we need to obtain an accurate and clear explanation of why there are problems in this area .
i would also like to thank mrs grelier for her report .
regarding fyrom - macedonia - it is important , as the commissioner has already said , that the country endeavour to reach the commission 's benchmarks this year , so that a decision can be taken on the start of negotiations .
this is unacceptable , mr president .
i would like to thank neena gill , the rapporteur , for having conveyed this message extremely clearly , much more than other rapporteurs , i must say .
i am therefore very pleased that we have reached this agreement .
the framework the directive establishes on this basis will allow us to provide a structure for dialogue between carriers and airports when determining and collecting charges .
the entry into force of the agreement between the european union and the government of the faroes on scientific and technological cooperation will enable the faroe islands to participate fully in the european union 's seventh framework programme for research , technological development and demonstration activities .
in my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the pse group for this report and a member of the committee on employment and social affairs , i would like to express how pleased i am that the implementation of the european credit system for vocational education and training has been approved .
at the same time , our representations are regularly ignored in the human rights dialogue that the european union is conducting with the chinese representatives at all levels - with a friendly smile , but ignored and dismissed nonetheless .
i would be very happy to come back to you with concrete proposals once we have the concrete legislative documents .
i would like to call on the commission to adopt concrete measures to support the roma 's integration into the labour market through providing funding for training and retraining , as well as measures aimed at a strict application of the legislation on combating discrimination in employment .
the hellenic capital market commission should therefore be able to supply the data for greek companies .
on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( fr ) mr president , president - in - office , president of the commission , the forthcoming european council will take place in the context of the signature of a new treaty , immediately after a particularly important eu - africa summit and also - let us not forget - during the first phase of implementation of the annapolis process .
security issues form an element of policy requiring particular care by every country , and they need constant readjustment in a changing world .
it is easy to forget the arduous road to get to that point .
the figure that he quoted concerns only managerial staff .
mr president , europe 's future depends on securing energy .
the commission is working in that direction .
the aim was , and still is , to curb inflation risks created by high living costs , by escalating petrol and oil prices .
the evidence brought by this committee following fact - finding missions in the area have clearly shown the encroachment caused by the construction industry and the need to defend the rights of spanish citizens as enshrined in the treaties .
the fact is , agriculture is the sole means of existence for 70 % of the world 's poor , as mr diouf underlined .
the reform treaty transfers the principle of free competition from the main body of the treaty to the protocols that are to be annexed to the treaty .
mr president , on a point of order , i think mr leinen said that you should have been satisfied that the 40 members were counted at the beginning - i.e. earlier on today .
i trust that you will find it a solid and balanced proposal which takes into account parliament 's recommendations and concerns .
this is the area where impressive savings can be realised with relatively small outlay .
you can understand both sides .
eu transport ministers are meeting today to decide how to deal with the air transport situation .
the popular struggle must be united against the imperialist system as a whole .
firstly , the fishing waters belong to the individual countries , not to brussels .
in relation to brazilian beef we have concerns about that too .
it sends us a report which sweeps three - quarters of the subjects under the carpet .
mr president , i came down to the chamber while i was watching the debate in my office just to make , i suppose , a broad point .
it aims to eliminate the market regulation mechanisms , liberalise planting rights from 2015 and allow the cohabitation , under virtually identical labels , of very different categories of wine .
the european parliament is therefore largely in agreement and has also repeatedly expressed this in its resolutions .
two thirds of these people are not making the homeward journey .
mr president , commissioner , timber is a valuable building material ; it is healthy , practical , perhaps a bit lacking in fire resistance , but increasingly sought - after .
the action taken by the new president shows that that activity is regarded as illegal and intolerable on ethical and moral grounds .
i come from ireland , a nation that had to export 12 million of its people over a hundred years .
while condemning the ' violence ' perpetrated by the pkk and ' other terrorist groups ' , it merely advises the turkish army not to engage in any ' disproportionate military operations ' .
( fi ) mr president , europe 2020 was , in the wake of the deepest crisis in european economic history , supposed to represent a new beginning .
we do not feel that this type of measure is in line with good european practice , and it would not be found in similar cases in other eu member states .
a third point - and this is information arising from yesterday 's ecofin talks - is that only one member state out of the 27 was in favour of using this instrument yesterday , and that was the member state that has already used it .
therefore , with your permission , i should like to put a specific question to the commissioner .
the realisation of a full single market is essential to europe 's economic success .
more than 60 people perished , there were many casualties , and thousands of hectares were reduced to ashes .
all of a sudden there is going to be a second vote .
co 2 emissions caused by road transport amount to about 70 % of all transport - related co 2 emissions .
i personally hope nevertheless that belarus , if it does not reunite with russia as some within the kremlin would like , will one day enter its rightful place amongst the european family of free nations .
they include all the partnership countries , not just those included in the neighbourhood and pre - accession programmes , but all partnership countries .
many people have spoken about assessing the effectiveness of security measures , particularly counter - terrorism measures .

from the perspective of my group , i would like to underline that that is the crucial test that the commission has to live up to and we need to contribute to because , if so , we can all contribute to europe with more and better innovations .
firstly , let me say that the lisbon treaty is not a train wreck and it is nonsense to be saying that .
i call on our members not to be naïve today .
this case is , for us , a particularly conspicuous act of terror , because it was carried out against a parliament .
substances that are proven to be detrimental to health will not be licensed , on that we are in agreement .
we should clearly recognise that it remains an american problem in which we could prove helpful , if only for the fact that human rights are paramount to us .
we believe that those who come here as observers should relinquish their national mandates .
how does the commission view this problem and what measures would it propose we take ?
the eu must put in place the basic conditions needed to safeguard the future of our farmers so that they can stay competitive internationally and their businesses can remain economically viable , despite the fact that we have the strictest animal welfare standards in the world .
we should categorically reject such hidden tactics here and now , because we have successful transaction taxes even at a national level and these transaction taxes work in sub - markets .
nevertheless , there is no doubt that much remains to be done in this respect , and that the european union and the russian federation not only share a historical , cultural and religious heritage , but that they also have common interests and challenges which warrant a closer relationship on many levels .
a constituent of mine recently returned from a holiday in another eu country .
in addition , incentives for energy efficiency are laid down as well as , albeit with no purpose specification , an obligation on the part of member states to invest at least half of the revenues in developing countries and new technologies .
perhaps these aspects will be removed during the trialogue - i am relying on the rapporteur in this regard .
since the drop in aggregate demand will affect the implementation of the budget by greece and ireland in 2011 , the ecb will then come and tell us that the austerity policy was right , but that it did not go far enough or deep enough .
it is about all of us , what we have achieved together at the european parliament in the last 15 months , and what is ahead of us .
again , additional funding for a price monitoring system on fish prices will be made available by the budgetary authorities by september .
what we do not need is carelessness or any turning of a blind eye by those who are responsible for monitoring .
it is what the societies of those countries expect , and it is what they deserve .
i would like to draw attention to the importance of reforming the ecolabel scheme and to the need to simplify the system by reducing the administrative burdens involved in using the label and extending the range of the product categories participating in the scheme .
a ban on this kind of weapon must be implemented globally , through the un and on the initiative of the nation states , not by the european parliament .
our consumers and our farmers deserve clarification .
our involvement in zimbabwe is well known , but we should continue to mention it , again and again , precisely because of people like abel chikomo .
those responsible should not complain if this fear of citizens again goes against official europe in the subsequent european elections .
finally , we need new public financing sources .
the european union will give added value to the initiatives developed by the member states .
even the eu 's employment record over the past ten years has clearly shown that atypical and precarious jobs , in particular , have risen to 60 % .
however , most of the problems identified then are still current today , in particular , the problem of domestic violence against women and the involvement of women in armed conflicts .
this is ridiculous .
i do not think it can be left in the hands of the parliament 's services to determine which amendments relate to the treaty of lisbon and which do not .
the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe , which represents centre and liberal parties in the european parliament , has so far been the only one of parliament 's political groups to say that strasbourg should stop being used .
he said that the economies of europe are too different for the euro .
that is what mr gerbrandy said .
for instance , one young latvian in three is unemployed , while approximately 43 % of spanish citizens under the age of 25 are affected by this problem .
the ivory coast document talks about the amount of money that we are spending on doing this .
let us recall the words of angela merkel , and i quote - use different terminology without changing the legal substance , for example with regard to the title of the treaty , the denomination of legal acts , and the union 's minister of foreign affairs - end of quote .
prevention of unequal treatment is a highly significant question , but we must not forget about people who suffer discrimination .
in greece , for example , 35 spouse murders have been recorded over the past eighteen months .
significant progress has been made in securing the borders and improving cooperation in combating cross - border crime - like human trafficking and drug trafficking - and it will be possible to return persons who are illegally staying on european soil .
the tanzanian government must take consistent measures to end this dreadful situation .
it is particularly unacceptable that this form of this aid is falling in hungary .
the economic community of west african states ( ecowas ) called for a full international inquiry into the matter .
the youth on the move dossier does not focus very much on the importance of the market ; we actually wanted to avoid that question altogether , but we have emphasised in several places that education systems need to adapt to the needs of society and the economy , and that this large gulf , this large gap , should be reduced as much as possible and that young people should be enabled to enter the labour market with as few obstacles as possible .
the success of the europe 2020 strategy , too , will largely depend on the success of the eu 's cohesion policy , which is why it is extremely important that , in the next seven - year period , these funds remain a priority for the european budget .
in effect , however , you are betraying one of the most important principles of the treaty of lisbon , namely article 4 ( 2 ) : ' the union shall respect the equality of member states before the treaties as well as their national identities , inherent in their fundamental structures , political and constitutional ' .
he is now chair of the subcommittee on security and defence , and , when he writes a report saying that the european union needed its own armed forces , then we can be confident that that is precisely what the european union intends to bring about in due course .
parliament is aware of the statement .
the doubtful effects of the kyoto protocol , the privileged position of developing countries and the rising costs of this policy make us opposed to this resolution .
we need more europe on this , and not less europe .
in all member states , responsibility for financing care must be taken away from social security systems and become a community responsibility .
we have got to have the right number there to keep the landscape but have a good quality sheep that can then be marketed properly .
a significant factor in this is , i think , a rational policy for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
the treaty of lisbon has given parliament new responsibilities .
mamuth said that , when he eventually got his refugee status in greece , he would not be able to travel freely and that it would take an eternity before he was granted greek nationality .
in the process of trying to make this cooperation effective and meet the needs of citizens as quickly as possible , we realised the importance of electronically processing and exchanging data between the institutions of the various member states .
the budget headings should be revised during the mid - term review , because our budget should respond to what the european union deems to be most important .
we have to build a social europe , based upon solidarity , economic , social and territorial cohesion .
e-justice within this parliament , and certainly within the committee on legal affairs , also chimes in with the theme that we have long had close to our hearts , that of access to justice and how we provide access to justice on a cross - border basis .
the crisis in greece and the attack on the euro require a joint response , but unfortunately , this has been delayed .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as a hungarian from slovakia , i declare that the slovak language law is bad .
the geographical breadth of the european union has to be represented within the external action service .
since this could pose problems for some banks or insurance companies , we advocate that this capital increase take the form of government holdings entailing corresponding influence on company policy .
in other words , we are not first determining what the general thinking in europe is on data protection , and then applying it across the board to every matter and every international partner , whether it be the us today , or china , south korea , or saudi arabia in the future : any of the international partners who request this type of data .
the single labour market , which is not yet developed , would enable jobseekers to gain new skills and experience and would provide them with an opportunity to choose a job and realise their skills , and employers would be able to choose from a larger number of employees in order to secure the specialists required .
the lisbon treaty now demonstrates that europe is ready , confident and self - assured .
one of these questions is this : has frontex fully incorporated human rights obligations into its existing regulatory provisions and practices ?
it is a deficit that has not been used to propel change in the productive model , either .
i should also like to say thank you for all the many positive comments that have been made in this house today about the negotiations that have been carried out .
we would like to extend a warm welcome to them .
the time of economic difficulty that we are currently experiencing is a moment when we are ready to fundamentally uproot the ideas we have had up until now and when we are most open to innovation .
that has been an absolutely crucial issue , and i am pleased that we have also been able to achieve what we wanted to in this regard .
it is more important to send a clear message of support for the stockholm programme from the european parliament .
i would like to thank the committee on foreign affairs and particularly the chairman , mr saryusz - wolski , for taking this initiative and for giving parliament an opportunity to debate this extremely important issue for europe , and i look forward to continuing our cooperation in the future .
one of the most important innovations that the commission introduces in the communication concerns a ' new ' working method .
the european union has played an immensely important role in the process of economic and political reconstruction of the countries of the former yugoslavia .
prepare yourself for our harsh , but fair , exchange of views with you and your college .
eu - russia summit on 18 november 2009 in stockholm ( debate )
we do not need to think about what we might have done differently to be able to prevent the hatred .
on behalf of the alde group . - mr president , the commission is quite correct to say that the service ought to combine all the instruments and assets that are required for the conduct of an active foreign policy across the globe .
2 .
this target is fundamental for helping europe to meet its objective of reducing co 2 emissions , and to reduce dependency on fossil fuels , but it should continue to be exactly that , a target which the various states adhere to voluntarily .
as i have already indicated , part of the reason i was very pleased to be able to participate in this debate is that this has been raised once before with the foreign affairs council - but we will come back to it at the end of january - and the concerns that honourable members have made have resonated and echoed with the concerns which have been raised with me from a variety of different sources , not least from some of the member states and some of the ministers who have been most concerned about these issues .
we must realise that when we speak of coal , we are talking about areas that have no alternative to mines and should be allowed the opportunity to adopt production technologies that are competitive and compatible with the free market and with the environment .
i am therefore looking forward to a clear answer concerning the compatibility of the eu rail network with the ertms standard .
it is like hearing that a hurricane or tsunami is coming and being told that we should reflect on the positive aspects of water and wind !
these are ' red lines ' , as they say in english , which must not be crossed according to the eu 's ruling circles .
( cs ) mr president , i have been saying , for many years , that a privileged partnership between the union and turkey would have been far more beneficial than the promise of turkey 's entry into the european union .
this murder was committed in the context that mr taseer opposed the notorious blasphemy law which has been a legal justification for the persecution and suppression of other religious groups .
in the uk , bt has come a long way from nationalised telecommunication provider to a successful regulated company .
data supplied by eurobarometer and gathered by coldiretti in italy show that in a food emergency , 43 % of italians , for example , avoid the foods they have heard about for a certain length of time , whereas 13 % cut them out of their diet for good .
the two - headed head of the european external actions must wear both hats at all times , thus assuring the unity of the service and the coherence of its action .
it has also driven us to look towards making changes to the european economy and to its production capacity , and towards improving competitiveness in the whole of the union .
it is the first legislative action in the area of young people since this cooperation came into existence more than 20 years ago and i am delighted that it is also closely linked to volunteering in sport .
vice - president reding has met many ministers over the last few months and they have explained that the national leave systems work well and that it is not possible , given the current financial constraints , to increase the length or payment , but the commission made it very clear that it is not prepared to reduce the level of ambition of this proposal .
( pl ) mr president , i wish to draw attention to a very important problem in the european commission , and one which is constantly neglected here in the forum of the european parliament : it concerns transport communications .
irish farmers do an excellent job of ensuring that their goods and the production processes used are of top quality , and equivalent standards are required to ensure a level playing field , proper competition and the sustainability of the european agricultural sector .
the member states can encourage , or make it easier for , people to choose ecological products through market - based instruments .
by the way , if banks were to require longer - term state support , they too would be subject to similar requirements to the polish shipyards .
for this reason , my group will give its consent to enhanced cooperation .
i think we should say , today , that it ought to be greater , and that the greater it is , the greater and more ambitious can be our expectations of ukraine .
i welcome mr coelho 's report and his proposal on the need for bulgaria to take additional measures , by preparing a special action plan with greece and turkey , due to the problem of illegal immigration on the greco - bulgarian border .
europe , together with norway , produces more than 200 million tonnes of crude oil a year , most of it from the north sea .
many procedural guarantees and legal rights for migrants to appeal against deportation have vanished from the final text , which could also put at risk the rights of those migrants who are able to apply for asylum .
a targeted action plan is the best way of giving fresh impetus and contributing significantly to targets on safety and the environment as well as to those on traffic flow improvement for road transport .
in addition , as the court of auditors says , there are significant errors and a high incidence of non - quantifiable errors , which should be improved .
we regret , therefore , that coreper decided , against the commission 's will , to reduce parliament 's role in an issue intimately related to parliament 's business , namely the financing of the political parties .
i therefore support the package of measures that the european commission has tabled on economic governance .
i am grateful that it was relaunched by the swedish presidency , but it is only a roadmap on a step - by - step basis .
i say quite clearly that guaranteeing a settlement system that functions properly , especially on fast - moving markets , is essential to the stability of the financial markets and , in times such as these , is even more important .
besides the destructive action of the economic crisis , we can also see the effects of the colonial approach in the past of the old eu countries towards enterprises and banks in the new member states .
( ro ) approximately 2 million passengers in the eu - 27 use air transport every year , with 22 % travelling domestically , 44 % inside the eu and 34 % outside the eu .
we in the european commission have always supported this treaty , and we had reason to think that , by taking the time to listen to the concerns of our irish friends , together we would be able to find the elements for a solution .
prisoners who cannot be sent back to their country of origin due to a risk of torture or persecution should be allowed to remain in the united states , where they should receive humanitarian protection and compensation .
at the present juncture , financial stability is being safeguarded by the eu - imf stability mechanisms and especially by the actions that the member states - especially the vulnerable member states - are themselves taking .
( it ) madam president , president of the council , president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , in my political worldview , ideals need to be reconciled with interests .
yet we are a force in the world due to our social model .
for example , the regulations have been simplified and made more flexible , and that will help to make us more competitive .
the compulsory control by the european parliament is inalienable .
for this reason , the proposals for implementing integrated pesticide management , the use of alternative substances and risk management will help yield suitable agricultural products which take into account the environment and public health safety , thereby reducing dependency on plant protection products .
the cholera epidemic that has gripped the country has highlighted the incapacity of the haitian state to react appropriately to the situation , along with the limitations of the international aid system .
we must demand reciprocity and access to foreign markets for our own products .
every so often , indeed very often , information reaches us of further attacks , beatings , threats and even murders , including the burning alive of christian people only because they are christians , including women and children .
( fr ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , it is in this time of crisis that the value and usefulness of structures will be shown , and this crisis is showing us that the europe of brussels is no use at all .
' one world , one dream ' : the slogan of the beijing olympic games fully highlights and faithfully represents the fundamental principles of the games .
i also thank you on behalf of bishop ján vojtaššák , monsignor viktor trstenský , štefan putanko , štefan janík and thousands of other brave sons of the slovak nation who were victims of communism .
of course one reason is the serious nuclear accident in japan .
moreover , the minimum harmonisation of the directive has caused legal fragmentation in the member states .
they will have to carry out a comprehensive assessment of any risks that a toy could conceal , regardless of where the toy is produced .
they are two major issues as you are well aware : mitigation and financing .
we must encourage our farmers to produce that extra food .
it is for this reason that i renew my appeal to create a genuine european civil protection force capable of being deployed rapidly and effectively following disasters of such seriousness .
so it is time for politicians in this chamber to stop emitting their own hot air over energy efficiency and climate change , cut out the hypocrisy and close down the strasbourg parliament .
we are facing floods , desertification , water shortages , forest fires , glacial meltdown , and changes in the flora .
rather , it is a mechanism intended to extend to all member states procedures that are already in use , sometimes in different ways .
it seems to me that what is needed here is more partnership and amicable negotiations , as there is room for both airbus and boeing in the world market .
this means , then , that the european commission can really be effective in the area where it really has competence , that is , in matters of gender mainstreaming - equal opportunities for men and women - to combat discrimination by introducing improvements to legislation and particularly by exerting pressure on member states to implement legislation so that things finally get moving .
this should be all - inclusive , in the sense that it should cover domestic violence and genital mutilation , but also some more insidious forms .
the commission must regulate the procedures and conditions stipulated in the treaty of lisbon whereby eu citizens can invite the commission to present a legislative proposal on issues which they regard as necessary .
the obama administration merely declared that it was disappointed with the decision by the italian court .
while the interim agreement includes specific provisions on the rules of origin for fishery products , it was important to manage this derogation .
a community tax base is a blow to tax competition in the eu , with all the associated negative consequences .
i think that the energy crisis will become more acute in future years , so getting the right market framework in place , and creating the right kind of incentives for the right kind of investment , is crucial .
the first is the dispute regarding the so - called intermediate category , which runs very much along national lines .
we finished the conference 10 minutes ago .
for customers whose primary concern was not the date of the trip but rather the cost of the ticket , skyeurope was the preferred choice in the czech republic .
the pressure from the united states must have been enormous .
commissioner füle will take the floor on behalf of the vice - president of the commission / high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy .
no black anti - communist front can wipe out the huge contribution made by socialism , its unprecedented achievements and its abolition of the exploitation of man by man .
no option on our agenda should be neglected in order to reduce our energy import dependency .
i would invite the agrochemical industry and their cerp community to look into and invest in this area .
in fact , the problems concern the dreadful name issue , which is being misused for the purposes of blackmail by both sides .
the eu basically needs to deal with the process of establishing democracy and reinforcing stability in kosovo .
i believe it is time to have done with all this .
one is , why this great haste and why this fast pace , because the commission only tabled its proposal in july .
before the vote :
in addition , the recovery plan must also serve the purpose of delivering a fair international agreement to give poorer countries the opportunity to escape poverty without fuelling global warming , by helping to finance massive investment .
we know that the mexican authorities are taking this seriously and have put in place a lot of measures to address the problem .
( es ) madam president , the year that is coming to an end - 2010 - has been described more than once as the year in which we lived dangerously .
my message to them is clear : butt out of an irish sovereign decision , because nobody will tell the irish electors what to do .
having said that , i think that the exercise agreed on by our member states and european partners will be a serious one .
16 .
i would like to take this opportunity to address the government of cambodia and request their compliance with the u.n. special rapporteur 's report in a swift and timely manner .
the statistics show just the contrary .
( explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with rule 170 of the rules of procedure )
what were the procedural matters that we changed ?
i would also like to express my thanks for the huge amount of support that members from all groups have shown for the presidency 's absolute top priority , namely to reach an agreement in copenhagen .
on a final note , i would like to assure baroness ashton that parliament will continue to scrutinise closely the work of the european external action service and will criticise inaction or the ineffectiveness of action taken in the area of human rights .
yes , the european union must be firm with regard to all human rights violations .
i believe that it is a stage of this dialogue .
now that we are to carry out a mid - term review , we have the opportunity to ensure that it is better adapted to dealing with the ever more complicated reality in which we live and in which radical measures are required . ( debate )
i think that the budget policy for the 2014-2021 period can only be devised and structured after these policies have been finalised .
it seems not , just this once !
europe needs to step in here with practical , properly funded programmes to enable health professionals to do the work they were trained for in their own countries , under proper conditions and within proper structures , with the necessary equipment and medicines .
economic forecasts predict a major reduction in eu growth of 1.1 % in 2010 .
we call on public authorities to fully protect all religious communities , including christians , from discrimination and from repression .
however , the real problem to solve - and the true priority of the report - is to pay attention to products intended for children and to products that appeal to them .
the governments ignored the writing on the wall after the ' no ' vote in france and the netherlands .
the floods in ireland during november 2009 caused severe damage , particularly to the agricultural sector , homes and businesses , the road network and other infrastructure .
thank you for your attention .
attempts have been made to question people who could communicate with the eu representatives , and this is completely unacceptable .
to begin with , we must bring about a new dynamism in the sector by putting effective structures and appropriate measures in place ; after all , this sector provides large numbers of jobs throughout europe both directly and indirectly and , in particular , is essential for the development of our coastal and port areas .
the first message to take from this today is that we want a green single market .
documents received : see minutes
when regulation ( ec ) no 717/2007 was adopted , the price of calls between networks did not fall markedly , but remained near the upper limit set by the regulation .
for this reason , i voted in favour of parliament 's proposal , which adopts the commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the consultative working party of the legal services of the european parliament , the council and the commission .
nevertheless , i am convinced that an essential precondition for community media as well as any other local media financed , even partially , from public funds , is to be independent not only from national but also from local power .
attention should be drawn to the fact that the new regulation would result in much confusion and a lack of clarity in this area .
however , the present global economic crisis is also a challenge .
i also fully concur with the need to ensure coherence and complementarity between the various instruments which currently exist for supporting research , development and innovation .
i consider the initiative to create a black sea euroregion for promoting democracy at regional level , which was launched by the council of europe , a good starting point in this direction and i invite the commission to manifest its entire support for their success .
mr vice - president , all eyes are on you , now !
( de ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , what i feel is missing from this debate is the necessary distinction between national transposition in the member states and the task that exists at european level .
own - account drivers , i know for a fact , are under tremendous pressure to work night and day .
this is why one of the eu 's eight human rights guidelines explicitly aims to ' promote gender equality and combat discrimination against women ' .
that is why i am against traffic light labelling .
however , it seems clear that negotiations have not fully addressed many other serious concerns of this parliament and , of course , of our socialist and democrat group .
then we had a pledge of a common european energy policy , but three years on it seems like nothing has changed .
this , too , is schengen .
as the rapporteur recommends , it is now time to develop a european judicial culture alongside the national judicial cultures .
president - in - office , we , your fellow europeans , are your friends .
we look forward to broad support in this chamber .
i would particularly like to bring your attention to standards relating to the indication of origin .
i think that we should have been very clear that it must not be permitted to lead the internet down such a blind alley .
the ruling of the lithuanian constitutional court on the spelling of polish surnames only in lithuanian transcription is an example .
i have one final comment to make , and that is that the programme is being complemented by corresponding national programmes in all the member states .
moreover , we are planning to develop a new type of cooperation whereby the european parliament would be involved in the preparatory work of delegated acts , and we would like to do this on very solid ground .
this charter is legally binding and enables women to be protected in the same way as men .
i therefore understand the concern that the local elections , which are key in terms of fostering democracy , strengthening it and establishing it , may involve certain rights being violated .
on behalf of the ecr group . - madam president , i would like to share with you some extracts from the interim report of the uk chief inspector of nuclear installations : ' we all need to adhere to the principal of continuous improvement .
in recent years , eu member states , faced with a dramatic decline in the birth rate , have had to cope with an increasingly ageing population .
yet is it not true that , if it is possible to abduct a child , it is also possible to get hold of his or her passport ?
in that context , the benefits that selective distribution brings to consumers , both in the on - line and off - line worlds , will certainly be revisited .
the cyanide disaster on the tisza river ten years ago , as well as accidents that have occurred since then , also serve as reminders of this problem .
i am convinced that a ceiling on direct payments would unquestionably discriminate against large farms .
i think that the review of the athena mechanism by the polish presidency will solve the budget problem .
i would therefore encourage baroness ashton to perhaps steer the union 's strategy back on the course plotted by the commission in 2005 in its report for the barcelona summit .
( bg ) mr president , we are concluding during this session our evaluation of bulgaria 's and romania 's readiness to join the schengen area .
parliament has in fact already approached it on this matter .
this had the makings of a great report .
eu - cameroon forest law agreement
the aim of the directive on consumer rights is to simplify contractual relations between consumers and businesses , thereby contributing to the better functioning of the internal market and increasing their confidence in cross - border purchases .
should there be a safety valve for members of the european parliament to raise the matter on the floor of this house ?
we have made considerable progress in those 100 years , but much remains to be done .
the monuc head claims that they have instructions to open fire if necessary .
i will do my utmost to have the agreement of the contracting parties that we can fully inform you .
the debate is closed .
my second reason is that the new offence of harassment has the alarming prospect of , in fact , curbing the rights in respect of freedom of speech and freedom of religion , particularly for those who proclaim a christian message .
secondly , we must have the courage to aim for freedom and flexibility .
occurrences like this can be prevented when the commission and parliament take adequate action , as mr jarzembowski has said .
in my opinion , this needs to be effectively combated in the transit countries in particular .
it cannot be said , however , that promptness and efficiency characterise the council when it comes to formulating a common stand .
once again , after the immigration - related accusations made against the italian government in this house by those who are on the opposition not because of a strange conspiracy that they see themselves as the victims of , but because of the sovereign will of the people , an opportunistic , ridiculous and self - serving attempt has been made to distort the reality of the situation in italy , with the sole aim being to denigrate the government and our country in the person of our prime minister , mr berlusconi .
the next item is the debate on :
this is what will strengthen the role of the family .
i am sure that it would be very well received by european public opinion because , as i said earlier , we are talking about a very vulnerable group which touches the hearts and minds of all european citizens .
in the words of the hungarian poet attila józsef , ' it is a great enough struggle to admit the past ' .
in other words , this common foreign policy on energy does not yet exist .
during the meeting of the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs ( libe ) , i asked that we might hear from the brazilian ambassador to the european union in order to discuss some fundamental issues such as the respect of human rights , the fight against terrorism , and views on freedom and security in europe and brazil .
thus the ministerial meeting in the algarve has plenty of work to do .
the directive concerning asylum has been in force since 2003 and is working .
- ( pl ) mr president , commissioner , the fact that elections are observed by recognised institutions improves the election atmosphere and sometimes even helps to crystallise significant changes , as happened , for example , during the orange revolution in kiev .
it is not just about languages and cultures : it is about peoples ' needs and their abilities and catering to the wide diversity of that as well .
bearing in mind the growing importance of the partnership between the two countries , the addition of korea to the other three partners with which the eu has agreements in the range of anti - competitive activity seems fully justified .
our thanks also go , in particular , to alexandre lamfalussy , the president of the european monetary institute , whom we met yesterday evening , and who is also taking part in a colloquium now .
this makes it practically impossible for creditors to block those funds .
first of all , those who are on the spot will tell us clearly what they need .
as council regulation ( ec ) no 55/2008 expires on 31 december 2012 , and as it is important to ensure legal certainty for producers , exporters and importers , it is proposed to extend the validity of council regulation ( ec ) no 55/2008 for another three years to 31 december 2015 .
as i said , he has now left the stage and i wonder whether he saw the writing on the wall .
as brussels will only provide the money for the esf when the member states take responsibility for cofinancing , this means that there will be around eur 150 billion on the table for creating more and better jobs .
in writing . - ( fr ) the worthy sentiments propounded by the different political groups , with the notable exception of the communists ( and with just cause ) , is merely an echo of the political correctness spouted by the hippies of international show business .
the report is both helpful and encouraging .
macro - regional strategies represent a way to the future , being , to a considerable degree , unique projects hitherto unparalleled in the european union .
seven months ago , i supported here the need to urgently revise the provisions relating to offences against religions in the so - called ' blasphemy laws ' .
in our view , that also implied a strict disclosure obligation for the authorities and provisions on public freedom of information .
i call on the commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points ; i am sure it can count on the support of parliament in this .
fortunately , a section of this wall was knocked down last year , when we removed the visa requirement for citizens of macedonia , montenegro and serbia .
on behalf of my group , i want to give mr solana a very clear message : for goodness ' sake , press ahead !
mr president , i was in the chamber on monday evening when the green group asked for a postponement .
the one thing that the commission could do to address the disproportionately high prices of food is to announce tomorrow that they are going to dismantle the common agricultural policy , but of course they will not do that because certain member states , particularly france , benefit disproportionately from huge sums of taxpayers ' money being poured into an inefficient , grossly disproportionate farming sector .
the question of young people is complex and requires the involvement of many policy areas .
( it ) mr president , romania and bulgaria adopted the schengen acquis when they joined the european union in 2007 , yet both countries still carry out border checks as a result of the partial application of the measures contained in the acquis .
that is the condition governing transparency and it is also , in my view , the condition governing the citizens ' support .
in addition , the directive does not introduce unreasonable obstacles and costs , particularly where smes are concerned .

thanks to their generous involvement and commitment , we were able to include the following concepts : social integration ; the requirements of the labour market ; personal development along different training paths ; non - discrimination with the inclusion of disadvantaged persons ; equal opportunities ; respect for the principle of subsidiarity and the creation of coordination points within the member states .
that is my hope .
this is why our group is refusing to participate in the vote on this resolution .
a climate of insecurity will only serve to worsen the human rights situation and encourage violations of international humanitarian law .
it will be available for the council on 3 and 4 june .
i think we should remember this .
can we then exploit this situation to encourage belarus to change track ?
nevertheless , the commission is well placed to serve as a european information switchboard .
this is a breach of the basic legal principles of the eu member states and the european union as a whole .
the union and the member states must therefore provide financial or tax incentives to businesses and individuals , in order to focus on scientific and technical research and development in areas that are less lucrative but highly beneficial to the public .
we also believe that all members of the eeas , whether officials of the eu institutions or member states ' officials on temporary contracts , should enjoy the same rights .
the eu must work with the nations of europe to ensure that we adopt a coherent strategy to promote the industries attached to our rich and culturally diverse continent .
however , the westminster government is looking into rolling out hgv charges in accordance with european law by 2015 .
the collection of data will not impose any additional burden on respondents .

to its credit , the report stresses the importance of completing the process whereby energy and communications in particular are opened up to competition , because developed and open networks are ultimately in the interests of the consumer and a guarantee of growth .
aside from the fact that the budget headings , in my view , are an incredible waste of european taxpayers ' money , they are doing more harm than good .
mr president , it took ireland 700 years to get the british out of the republic of ireland and i have to sit here time and again listening to people we threw out telling us what we should be doing in ireland .
on behalf of the ppe group . - mr president , on behalf of the ppe group , i propose the following oral amendment to paragraph 7 : the words ' deplores the azerbaijani authorities ' decision not ' should be replaced with the words ' urges the azerbaijani authorities ' .
we all agree that the debate started on the future cohesion policy should be supplemented by the territorial dimension .
over the course of the two - day visit , our delegation held an extremely informative exchange of views with members of the icelandic government and of the icelandic parliament in relation to their application for membership .
so the status quo is really not an option for the commission .
i reject the absolutist approach to human rights .
the bond of trust between consumers and producers has once again been broken .
the conflict between israel and gaza has simply gone on too long .
artistic studies in the european union (
instead , it tries to justify an eu - wide policy of neo - keynesian demand management by spending more on a great majority of items without any underlying structural reforms .
therefore we should start elaborating global standards .
it is a european problem , and i am pleased that there are members with a whole variety of perspectives speaking on this subject .
the penal code : article 301 has already been mentioned , that is quite clear .
its conclusions indicate that romania meets all the schengen acquis requirements .
the situation with the hidden population of older children from three to six years old , in other words the so - called little schools , is not much better .
on this topic , i call on the rapporteur , mr arlacchi , to revise , if possible , perhaps through an oral amendment , the passage on the use of drones on the ground and make it more operational .
i am therefore of the opinion that policy must be oriented in such a way that , within the scope of our competences , above all , support is given to public cord blood banks .
i also wish to pay tribute to the professionals themselves , who have displayed a real openness of mind , and i would like to say to them that i still feel a debt of gratitude towards them .
since agriculture is not simply an economic activity , and since agricultural and food policy must be in the service of essential objectives such as food supply and food security , the main challenge is the efficient harmonisation of commercial and non - commercial considerations .
we are their friends and must tell them that we are doing this .
i will simply add this : this dispute indirectly reveals several facts to which my group has constantly drawn attention .
morgan tsvangirai and the mdc majority deserve not just words of comfort or any sort of consolation position but rather to be invested in office according to the results of the 29 march elections .
mr wurtz 's group was leading a protest about the threat to 12 000 jobs at unilever .

these rules will give the payments industry three years to put forward a long - term commercial model for automated debits that abides by competition rules .
( es ) mr president , firstly i would like to thank mr florenz for his work , and , of course , the chairman of the committee and all the coordinators and members of the committee as well .
the first concerned the council 's responsibility for the choice of languages used in its presidency websites .
it is a conflict between the hopes and aspirations of our people to rid themselves of this occupation and the attempt by israel to destroy these aspirations , as well as obstructing international efforts that aim towards establishing a palestinian state by peaceful means .
this was used in the uk and it is estimated that , in the uk alone - and a dutch colleague said one per cent of their population is affected - it is something along the lines of 236 000 to 284 000 adults who have a gambling problem .
madam president , if we were to exclude all the countries that had breached the rules of monetary union , there would soon not be many members left .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , president ahmadinejad said today in busher , in the south of the country , that israel is a filthy zionist entity that will fall sooner or later .
when a major accident happens , those who live along the coast pay the consequences .
in the united states , there is equality between states in the senate .
( cs ) the mandatory certification system for bodies in charge of maintenance and placing in service railway vehicles is the only railway system improvement .
4 .
convictions of teenagers for homosexual behaviour may be in accordance with the law in force in iran , but we cannot , of course , agree with rule of law understood in this way .
firstly , the percentage of the total budget expenditure spent on agriculture is steadily falling and will be only 32 % in the last year of this budget perspective .
this must not happen .
the costs are literally halting the transport of goods .
a lot of other , very important points were made - and may i say that they were all right - about the role of community financing .
i do not understand how , in this house , one can stoop so low as to say such things , and i demand an apology , mr president .
you have prevented their oppressors from taking refuge in the fact that their crimes are forgotten .
everyone has spoken about it .
i favour this choice by the commission from a legislative excellence point of view , although i believe that the member states should be given sufficient time to analyse the possible consequences within the context of a broader review of the basic legal instrument in this area , namely the directive relating to measuring instruments ( directive 2004/22 / ec ) .
those two examples have been cases in point .
the summit will take place in the second half of 2008 .
however , our citizens cannot be burdened with a further structural crisis .
that became very clear in 1989 .
subject : new road charging system in slovenia
all of these have been conceived precisely for the purpose of sidestepping the capital adequacy and transparency requirements we impose on banks .
uniting and sharing are what the european union is all about .
a few points bear constant repetition .
i would like to hear the commissioner comment , in particular , on whether he is likely to encounter any difficulties in implementing the next budget in 2012 because of this actual decrease in the european budget as compared to the national budgets of the member states .
we cannot have a new agreement with morocco until we have a new system for entry prices .
undoubtedly , our hard - pressed farmers will be faced with yet more bureaucratic headaches .
will it be some kind of ' big brother ' ?
we all remember the outcome of the first flotilla and its consequences for talks and attempts to resume the peace process in the middle east .
it has to be said that we are entitled to discuss this matter because hungary is part of the european union .
( pl ) mr president , i would like to draw attention to two matters , which , in my opinion , are very important .
these legitimate demands for finding the right balance are , unfortunately , often used by the authorities to preserve the option of secretiveness .
such decisions should be taken by the member states themselves .
secondly : work has to be paid work .
the weakness of ukraine 's constitutional framework has also contributed to this .
in practice , this is not efficient and has led to situations were disputes remained unresolved , as they could easily be blocked by the ' injuring ' party .
the three - year reform of the financial regulation will enable us to establish the legal basis for this simplification , but i do not think that tinkering with the tolerable risk of error is the right way to go .
this is not a humanitarian crisis where we pay some money and then the government decides how to implement the projects .
in writing . - ( pl ) i should like to express my support for the report by mr grosch on the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council on the common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services ( recast ) .
i think that when viewed in relation to the instruments which we are using to combat climate change , these adaptation measures always need to be viewed with a critical eye .
i think it is absolutely essential for european citizens to be able to get information in any crisis situation , whether it be a general crisis or a crisis for themselves , and there needs to be an awful lot more clarity in the situation .
nevertheless , i abstained because in my opinion , the text does not go far enough .
at the summit with russia , the european union intends to express its full support for the partnership for modernisation , which will enable us to strengthen our cooperation in all areas , particularly in key areas such as innovation and energy .
this coming thursday , the heads of state or government of the european union are meeting for an extraordinary european summit in brussels at the instigation and on the invitation of our president herman van rompuy .
mr wijkman raised the point of inconsistency between emission trading systems and the carbon tax .
the commission will , in this regard , act in full accordance with its role as guardian of the treaties .
we in the eu believe in open borders and free trade as a sine qua non for peace and stability on our continent and also in the south caucasus .
will the government encourage political , ethnic , cultural and religious diversity ?
we had our own arguments over section 28 .
the public - private partnerships proposed by the commission are therefore an excellent solution .
we must not hesitate in combating the sovereign debt crisis that has been affecting some countries in the euro area .
( nl ) madam president , this is the third year of our financial perspectives and it is also the third year that we have gathered here to talk about their intermediate adjustment .
primary industries and power generation require many years of investment and concentration of capital , which means they need to be subsidised .
we need a special programme here .
the question , however , is whether we are going too far with the amendments to the rules of the globalisation fund .
talking about the fragility of the government right now and the situation in moldova , we have to remember experiences at the beginning of the 1990s in this country , when the difficult economic situation led to a failure to pay pensions and salaries and to a break in reforms .
this event has shown that strict environmental protection measures must be adhered to when oil is extracted from the deep sea .
a number of colleagues said , and i am only quoting an italian colleague : for the first time in the history of the union , we take into consideration the residents and not the citizens .
specifically in the uk , northern rock became insolvent as it raised money in the short - term markets to fund long - term liabilities .
in the years before and after this date , the critical human rights situation in burma was the subject of numerous parliamentary resolutions .
he is absolutely right too .
i support the terms of neil parish 's oral question today , which seeks to check on the level of compliance with these measures .
in the school year 2004/2005 , the european schools had 274 pupils with special educational needs .
for our group , the partnership between the european union and the acp countries is part of an historic commitment , which must retain all its specific characteristics , which must not be watered down , even by the need to comply with certain rules , such as those of the wto .
on this point , mr president , mr jouyet and mr barrot , we call for vigilance from the council and the commission and we promise that this parliament will do its utmost to work together with you .
where europeans are quick to see risks and hide fearfully behind the precautionary principle , americans see new opportunities .
to mitigate the problems , our words must therefore be in harmony with our actions .
( el ) mr president , the announcements of the results of the g 20 summit were important , there can be no doubt of that ; however , a second reading raises important questions on certain points .
it is correct that volatility in foreign exchange markets has increased in recent weeks , with significant shifts in the value of major bilateral exchange rates .
our aim is to adopt the proposal for a directive during the first quarter of 2011 .
i think that this piece of legislation will bode well during the current economic crisis because the european economy needs cohesion and its biggest driving force , smes .
both countries have met all the criteria .
all of this leads to mounting unemployment and problems for small and medium - sized enterprises and , in my opinion , we should perhaps focus on fewer issues in the future while ensuring that those issues we do focus on are implemented in full .
the commission has also proposed the modification of regulation ( ec ) no 1080/2006 on the european regional development fund , which would allow use of this fund by all member states for increased expenditure on energy efficiency improvements and the use of renewable energy in existing housing .
it also lays down a series of essential elements that must be specifically included in contracts .
( ro ) the european commission and member states financed a study published recently , which criticises the european union 's climate policies for being limited to reducing industrial greenhouse gas emissions without attaching importance to the natural capacity for capturing carbon dioxide .
( pl ) mr president , in view of the increasing amount of freight moving from the north to the south of the continent , and the insufficient number of transport corridors , i should like to underline the significance of the central european transport corridor , cetc road 65 .
that is why the proposals in this report , which aim to go beyond this approach , to adopt a new definition of tax havens and to introduce new tools - including sanctions - to help in this fight are hugely important .
we have a number of balls in the air and we have to make sure that none of them falls while conducting economic policies : europe 2020 , economic governance , the single market and cohesion policy .
the next item is the joint debate on :
images of skeletal women sitting outside their burnt - out houses with hungry children in their arms , images that were common in poland and in other european countries during the second world war , are now a daily reality in chad and sudan .
nevertheless , we find it gratifying that the decision in favour of galileo has now been taken .
more firmness with regard to the member states , more submissions to the court of justice if necessary and more firmness in executing the decisions pronounced by the court .
( de ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to express my sincere congratulations to the rapporteur .
personal data , their protection and the individual right to this same protection are subjects that have increasingly been attracting interest from political decision makers and civil society itself .
( sk ) i am very disappointed that , despite the mounting social problems in eu member states affecting every single citizen regardless of nationality , questions relating to the duel between slovak and hungarian members are always being raised in plenary sessions in this institution , as is the case today at 10 minutes to midnight .
every agricultural product in the eu must be clearly labelled with the origin of the raw materials .
( the president cut off the speaker )
a clear target has been set by the european council to deliver by june 2011 .
i think that the particular circumstances at the moment , between copenhagen and parliament 's democratic process , meant that we absolutely had to conclude this at first reading , or there would not have been agreement , which was possible .
air baltic , with its machinations , is trying to make a fool of the european parliament .
transfers of appropriations : see minutes
antibiotic resistance is a subject which we must take seriously and which , hitherto , has had too little attention paid to it in the context of animal husbandry .
one can readily understand that every institution should wish to use specific symbols .
in writing . - ( de ) i voted in favour of the annual reports on simplified access to documents of the eu institutions .
i believe this is because here in parliament we do not act in a specific enough way and we are not honest enough , but rather pursue something resembling a general , headlines policy .
( pt ) mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the european qualifications framework for lifelong learning is a decisive document to enable the national and sectoral reference frameworks of qualifications to be compared at european level .
i agree with mrs wallis 's point that a call for a 50 - year moratorium on any exploitation is neither practical nor reasonable , but i think a limited moratorium on new exploitation - pending fresh scientific studies - is something all civilised nations could perhaps agree to .
i add my voice to the appeal by international humanitarian organisations to prevent the enormous number of children orphaned as a result of the earthquake becoming victims of human traffickers .
however , your predecessor did not act fairly in allowing many members to overrun by half a minute or 20 seconds - the commissioner also spoke for seven minutes and 36 seconds instead of three minutes .
at the same time , it is essential to note that we have already taken very substantial and significant policy decisions to stimulate the european economy and the world economy .
( sk ) the committee on internal market and consumer protection held intensive discussions about the provision of cross - border healthcare back when the services directive was debated .
the only possible opinion on this situation is that we condemn the perpetrators of the coup and demand that constitutional and civil order be restored in this country as soon as possible .
the argument that this will help small and medium - sized enterprises does not stand up because , with the figures quoted in the regulation , the enterprises in question are not small and medium - sized enterprises .
similarly , i can agree with the rapporteur that pre - trade , post - trade transparency needs improvement , and particularly that post - trade data for non - equity products are provided in a form which is readily consolidated .
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i had asked to speak on an issue connected with our work schedule : the fact that the new school year has coincided for some years , and will unfortunately coincide again next year , with our plenary poses major family problems for our members and for many of our officials .
we have a european directive in need of approval .
thinking about all the aspects that make up the framework of the inviolable rights of man , i consider , finally , that special attention should be paid to the most vulnerable individuals , namely children , the elderly , migrants , and young people looking for work .
as the gravity of the situation has increased , we have also acted as a ' facilitator ' as far as deliveries of gas to the community were concerned - a role that was very much appreciated by both parties , because they were not talking to each other at all .
this is due to the fact that the council has to deal with other matters as well .
for example , if countries like qatar , whose per capita income is higher than that of 25 member states of the european union , are included in the gsp system , i am certain that we need to take a very critical look at this when reviewing the whole system .
not only that , but married couples of the same sex should be able to move freely around europe and have their partnership legally recognised wherever they are .
that is encouraging , but it is not enough if we want to respect the 2 °c target .
this is what our development cooperation stands for , but our commitment must not be measured by budgetary allocations to the health sector alone .
in greece , the dangers come from the exploitation of gold in bulgaria , which is the evros catchment basin .
unlike the original commission proposal , which seemed to me a little divorced from practice , this new amendment has managed to move closer to the reality that prevails in commercial and contractual relationships .
on behalf of the uen group . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i too would like to thank the community institutions for the support they have shown for italy and the people hit by the earthquake .
i wonder , would the commission consider only funding , from a safety and interoperable point of view , rail systems that are operated electrically , and phase out over a period of time diesel - guzzling locomotives - i know in my own country all the rail systems are operated thus - and set a target date to have safe , interconnected and environmentally friendly rail systems across the entire european union ?
i am particularly happy to see that those killers we know as bull bars will now have to pass the same performance tests on the vehicles on which they are intended to be installed , although for me the campaign to ban bull bars outright still goes on .
security of energy supply is an important element of general security .
it is like a supply of oxygen and it has helped significantly to ensure that there have as yet been no mass redundancies among the major manufacturers in europe and that they have been able to retain their workforces .
mrs oomen - ruijten has asked for the floor .
in writing . - as i understood , this report deals with international investment treaties .
large parts of the report - which was voted through in plenary - are very sound , however , and my ' no ' vote should not be interpreted as an unwillingness to participate in the work on policy coherence for development .
i believe that we took a significant step forward in this respect as well .
it is the first step in a series of changes required to establish a credible economic government .
in summary , this means that there is currently no sustainable pension system , especially not without active people with disabilities .
i would also hope that when they vote tomorrow , members would look at every single amendment carefully to ensure we have the right balance between investment and carrying out our responsibilities as a parliament , and careful public spending .
we propose simplification and clarification of eu procurements directives by 2012 , in line with the green paper published earlier this year .
( pt ) mr president , commissioner , allow me to begin by highlighting the role of the rapporteur , mr van nistelrooij , for his work in search of consensus in this matter and also for the willingness that he always demonstrated to include other contributions in his report .
the solution can come only from the hungarian citizens , who will reject this constitution when they realise that an autocratic regime cannot provide high living standards and more freedom .
( fi ) madam president , i think this resolution is fine but slightly inconsistent as you get the impression in some places that one is , as it were , surrendering to terrorism .
despite the exceptionally technical nature of this proposed regulation , its value to europe and the member states should not be underestimated .
it is therefore necessary for us to have a cohesive and active policy - not only to save the jobs that it is possible to save , but also to help those who become unemployed to get back into the labour market .
at last we can now humanise capitalism !
let us not wake up to find that we are pushed away from the political and economic stage , which has been taken by another actor , or even being accused of passivity , lack of political vision and inability to resolve the conflicts in our neighbourhood .
however , i would like to say that i support the commission 's suggestions in principle , because the scientific experts ' reports are conclusive .
the last word of thanks goes to ms enikő győri .
these affect everyone , but they are particularly discriminatory towards women .
regarding africa 's development , i believe that there is so much work to do on this continent and that china , as a new player , should be welcome to participate .
this is part of the thessaloniki agenda and a cornerstone of our integration policy for the western balkans .
but the second point with regard to what this directive is doing - and possibly the most important of all - is that for the first time it recognises the contribution of session musicians by establishing a fund to allow them to ensure that they have a return and remuneration for their work - which has been exploited by people over a long period of time - for which they may only get a one - off payment if they are lucky .
citizens need to be placed at the heart of the single market .
i am pleased that the procedure for obtaining this permit has been simplified through a one - stop shop system , which will ease administrative procedures for foreign workers .
- ( pl ) mr president , the posting of workers directive is one of the foundations on which the practical implementation of one of the four basic community freedoms , which are european freedoms , is based and which has accompanied treaties and the european community right from the start .
in addition , the advanced mid - term review of the 10th edf will provide a good opportunity to identify new needs and assess whether these would be better addressed through general or sectoral budget support .
( fr ) madam president , this debate got off to a bad start , with the good guys , the anti - nuclear people , on one side , and the bad guys , those who still support nuclear power , on the other .
passengers are also concerned that different airlines behave differently towards passengers , and to always obtain compensation from these airlines through the courts is not the easiest thing .
we firmly believe in the importance of sending out a message of hope to citizens as regards the gloomier aspects , and we should therefore encourage you to reinforce those emsa mechanisms which proved to be useful precautionary , and then protective , measures for the coastline , to press ahead with this third maritime safety package and , in particular , to improve cooperation between ports , which was perhaps not always as good as it might have been , and certainly to present all those aspects relating to improving the quality of marine fuel , a proposal which was agreed recently by the imo and will certainly improve the outcome or consequences of this type of incident .
i especially look to commissioner verheugen on this .
in the case of large - scale offences , the international criminal court must play an important role and establish a close correlation with the decisions made by national courts .
i believe that this initiative will serve as a spur to member states to draw up prompt payment codes .
this law seems to have been drafted under the political influence of horthy , kádár , antonescu or ceauşescu .
to achieve these goals , we need to mobilise the flexibility instrument to the value of eur 105 million .
lastly , i believe that the commission should take account of the concerns expressed by the various associations in the sector , so as to ensure transparent and fair negotiations that do not harm the european economy .
i voted in support of the resolution .
we have an opportunity now to make a good impression .
secondly , exchanges of students and researchers between the universities of different countries , and increasing the funds available for their support .
however , in practice , the officers start to exercise power and find that they like it .
2006 discharge : european food safety authority (
i declare that my name is panayotopoulos and that i submitted a question about paragraph 6 of the framework for negotiations with turkey .
if there is anything that the recent financial turbulence has shown us , it is the benefit of a strong central bank that can withstand short - term solutions , not to mention the stabilising effect of participating in a large currency zone .
i hope , too , that it comes back to our people , who are very depressed and disillusioned by a feeling that they carry a very heavy burden for the rest of the european union .
we already know about the suppression of the ancient buddhist tibetan culture over the last 60 years ; now we see the same threat looming over the city of kashgar in the restive province of xinjiang .
this is certainly a case of progress therefore , and i welcome it .
i salute the courage of members of the gay community in uganda who bravely fight each day against this menacing threat to their identities and their very lives .
our economic partnership is a key driver of global economic prosperity and represents the largest , most integrated and longest lasting economic relationship in the world .
i am certain that my country would be a good host for the institute because of the government 's commitment to research and innovation / development , because of the country 's research infrastructure , because of hungary 's early role in the advancement of science , and not least because of hungary 's hospitality .
moreover , as mr le foll said at the start of his speech , we should consider implementing mechanisms for regulating the markets as part of the common agricultural policy post - 2013 .
in the past years , we have seen political instability , characterised by competition between the president and prime minister , exacerbated by a lack of clarity in the constitution .
i want to stress that as long as these violations of the law are allowed in bulgaria and the state continues not to take any action on the issue , honest voters are in actual fact being deprived of their basic human right - the right to choose !
we all recall events like the cod wars between the uk and iceland , which happened in particular before the introduction of the common fisheries policy .
the agreement marks a genuine step forward in promoting fishery resources and sustainable development .
one of the inspiring meetings providing us with an opportunity for joint discussions on the urban dimension was an event entitled european urban day , which i organised together with partners at the beginning of february in prague within the framework of the czech presidency of the eu .
the year 2020 is only 10 years away .
( lv ) i should like to confirm that the members of the group of the european people 's party from latvia will support president j. m. barroso 's candidature .
it seems that a central information source is lacking .
i congratulate our rapporteur for insisting on adoption at the first reading , which should accelerate the implementation of this programme , guarantee its effectiveness and prove that european legislation is perhaps not as cumbersome as people sometimes accuse it of being , but that it can act effectively in the interest of citizens .
i voted in favour of this report on using funds from the european globalisation adjustment fund ( egf ) , specifically for the 512 redundancies that have been made from nxl semiconductors netherlands , operating in the electronics sector in the nuts ii regions of gelderland and eindhoven .
at the same time , however , we must not interpret this report as meaning that the eu 's borders are going to be closed .
about a year ago , the european parliament , as a consequence of the ahtisaari report , agreed on the supervised sovereignty of kosovo .
this idea is today the subject of a consensus .
this is a solution that would enable us to avoid the consequences of restrictions on expenditure in a situation where irregularities are detected by a national control agency .
it includes the target of increasing the share of renewable energy sources to 20 % and improving energy efficiency by 20 % .
after all , the wave of protests was triggered by broken promises of political reform .
i voted in favour of this resolution because i believe that the full realisation of a dynamic services market is one of the basic priorities for the european union .
so we must look to the opportunities and take them , and not the negatives .
just as the people of france , germany or poland can speak about their nations ' past , so can those of hungary .
i will digress slightly , if i may , beyond the specific scope of the question .
if these obstacles are overcome , numerous question marks still remain about the viability of the two states which should coexist on the territory of the former sudan .
the commission must help : please , facilitate the transfer of best practice among member states and also ensure that minimum energy - performance standards are compatible whilst reflecting regional differences .
whilst amendment 4 poses some difficulty , i recognise the important work of the report and i recognise the importance of producing traceable , high quality and safe products .
on behalf of the pse group . - ( es ) mr president , i take a very positive view of the commission proposal to transpose the recovery plan for bluefin tuna agreed at iccat into the legal order and i agree with the commissioner that the measures it contains , if applied correctly , will allow a gradual recovery of stocks both in the atlantic and the mediterranean .
' follow me , i 'm right behind you , ' is the paradoxical slogan the eu has developed for itself .
i fully support the need to ensure that airports in a dominant position do not abuse that situation and i fully support an open and transparent appeals procedure , provided that the rules of engagement and the remit of the arbitrator are clearly defined .
the house has taken note of this .
it is true that in order to reduce these constraints , we need to diversify the forms of our dependence , from the viewpoint both of energy sources and of supplier countries .
( es ) mr president , i first wish to congratulate the ep rapporteur , mr castiglione , for his splendid work .
so , while i recognise that it is not possible to have no regulation , i also support the priority of better regulation , not least because that is something that legislators and governments can do .
i still regard enlargement as being very important , but i also believe that the differences expressed by five of the member states must be taken into account .
dates of forthcoming sittings : see minutes
their interests should be represented by their meps .
written statements ( rule 142 )
it is reasonable to focus , in particular , on goods and services that are susceptible to fraud in the fight against vat fraud , and the reverse charge mechanism gives these member states an opportunity to apply a reverse order arrangement , by way of derogation from the main principle of the vat directive .
it underlines that the member states have to support a locally oriented approach to formulating and implementing the cohesion policy .
the population of the gaza strip have only 60 % of their daily food needs available , which means that they are even more at risk of disease and exposed to difficult conditions .
our concern - and this really ought to be self - evident - is that all the budget appropriations that cannot be disbursed should be allocated to projects to create jobs , especially in projects aimed at energy security , energy efficiency and energy conservation .
the black monday that all world stock exchanges experienced this week once again demonstrates that the markets can lose all connection with reality and that the financial system has become difficult to control .
however , we must do everything we can to make it as difficult as possible for those responsible .
whatever happens with gas , the member states will still have the option to unbundle ownership or to continue pretty much as they are doing at present .
the circumstances of the most deprived persons in the member states should be dealt with by the member states or the municipalities .
i would like to point out that the polluter pays principle needs to be applied consistently throughout the whole chain - from trough to table .
the amendment makes the text clearer and simplifies the regulatory framework , while also reducing the administrative burden , thereby facilitating the application of the legislation to ensure the regeneration of the ozone layer by 2050 and prevent the adverse effects on human health and ecosystems .
( sl ) madam president , we are witnessing a new humanitarian tragedy on the european union 's doorstep .
the industry 's operators will be encouraged to make better use of the union 's various programmes , such as leonardo , the competitiveness and innovation framework programme , erasmus for young entrepreneurs , the european social fund and other programmes .
it is their constructive proposals and their willingness to compromise that has helped us to reach agreement and hopefully adopt this report with considerable support in plenary .
they are often ' ordinary ' people who show exceptional courage and dedication .
that being the case , there has been very intensive lobbying over recent days .
secondly , this morning , you mentioned food security , prime minister .
this summit is an opportunity for the eu to strengthen its relations with russia and to do so in a consistent manner that is productive for both parties , without neglecting the firmness and caution required on issues such as energy , defence , democracy and human rights .
we have therefore voted against this report in its entirety .
each country 's position , that is , their foreign policies should be linked to a binding political platform established by the eu ;
it is not only fish stocks but also the marine environment which stand to suffer .
france , which is currently chairing the g 20 , wants to promote the idea of global monetary reform and there is no proposal , like that of the eurobonds which we are trying to push , that would attempt to make the euro a truly global currency .
under the agreement , two units were closed in 2002 , and the other two in 2006 .
poverty affects two social groups most particularly : the low - skilled and those living with disabilities .
the result of the second referendum on the treaty of lisbon , held in ireland , does not change the anti - democratic nature of a process that has disregarded the will of the people from the very beginning .
given the importance of these missions , i feel it necessary that funding should be considered more quickly and , for the sake of transparency , for one budget line to be created for each mission .
the introduction and cultivation of gmos and the series of food scandals show that the quality and safety of food in the eu are subordinate to the interests of big business .
thank you , commissioner .
( applause )
i would be very grateful if we could pay serious consideration here in parliament over the next few weeks and months to the contribution that other areas of policy could make to trade policy in this respect .
mr president , firstly i want to thank the members who participated in the debate .
but that of course requires ireland to tell us , to tell the other countries , exactly what concerns were expressed ; to define a list of demands that we can then respond to or at least negotiate on .
however , there will be two priority initiatives in 2008 : there will be a directive on the conditions of entry and residence of seasonal workers and there will also be a directive on the entry , the temporary stay and residence of intracorporate transfers and remunerated trainees .
now we have the chance to turn the crisis into an opportunity .
while there are slight benefits in terms of slightly curbing most speculative transactions , in my opinion , the biggest benefits relate to entering the new field of taxation , a global mechanism and gathering resources - not so much in the financial sector , but especially for our european and global development and environmental needs .
it affects certain fisheries and we believe that the commission should include it because of the impact it has on the stocks themselves .
mr president , the european union has a great opportunity to endorse a move to strengthen international law at the next human rights council .
third , we reiterated our position that there is no military solution to this israeli - palestinian conflict , that the peace process is the only way forward and that efforts have to be stepped up as soon as we find a durable ceasefire .
author . - ( fr ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , firstly , please accept the apologies of my colleague , mr hutchinson , who could not be with us today .
information should be easily accessible to consumers and patient - oriented : it should be comprehensible and easily available , taking into account the particular needs of consumers such as age , cultural differences and availability in all european languages .
i am fully aware of the fact that people who are victims of multiple discrimination are very seriously affected .
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
you all deserved your holiday .
i would furthermore like to highlight all of the proposals that reveal the european commission 's intention to explore the growth potential of the single market .
i went to see some small businesses two weeks ago - successful companies supplying aerospace , automotive , energy industries .
what is done is done .
it is also true , ladies and gentlemen , that the commission wants to step up the information campaigns through its delegations in third countries , within the framework of the eu external relations policy and on the basis of the common definition of the mandates and roles of frontex .
every nuclear power installation , whether inside or outside europe , has the potential to be a weapon of destruction .
we must be careful to raise the health standards right across europe , in large countries as well as in small countries .
only the courts should be allowed to take such decisions , and only after convicting perpetrators of serious crimes .
a framework for controlling economic policy can perhaps be implemented by the various constituent member states , but not by the eu as a whole , because the strength of the different national economies varies so much .
the threat is nevertheless real and the european union must play its part in the efforts made to prevent and combat it as resolutely as possible . the security of its 500 million inhabitants and the defence of the essential values and principles on which it is founded depend on this .
actually , i think they should have gone to him , and i cannot believe they did not .
what is missing , what needs to be changed ?
it can take the lead in communicating the commissioner 's views to the member states and in suggesting to the member states that although we cannot compromise on the quality of food , we certainly should ensure that one body in each country will deal with aquaculture rather than cross - cutting through various departments and agencies .
( fr ) mr president , this must be the umpteenth report on the so - called rise of extremism in europe .
however , i would be the first to admit that we do not know all of the consequences for consumers of gambling on the internet .
i have put down amendments to current legislation to that effect , and we will be discussing these in this house shortly .
from my perspective , there is actually no real scientific or indeed objective evidence of that , given that we have not only the services directive but also the directive on the recognition of professional qualifications as well as other directives in the services sector .
this report , the european parliament 's response to the european commission annual statement on the euro area and public finances , is rich in analyses and proposals .
the transitional government has taken some important steps , in particular by freeing political prisoners and allowing freedom of expression , as well as prosecuting members of former president ben ali 's family for corruption .
given the well - known sceptical opinion of the czech president václav klaus on climate change , how is the council ensuring that the views of the vast majority of eu member states and citizens endorsing the scientific veracity of man - made climate change are being respected , specifically in relation to preparations for the copenhagen climate summit and the forthcoming swedish presidency ?
i voted in favour of the report by mr schwab because i consider it a sound basis on which to negotiate with the council and the commission the conclusion of an agreement on the level of harmonisation necessary to obtain consumer rights that can be exercised in every member state .
it is important to point out again that we are not starting from scratch : we already have a good basis , and it is just a matter of improving on that .
the greek authorities have already informally consulted the commission on these decisions on compensation , which were the subject of a preliminary examination .
of course , we all wish to step up the fight and win the war on terrorism , but frankly i wonder if , since we have both these aims , what we are debating will - as with all compromises - end up toning down the scope of the initiatives .
on the openness of european schools , in our view the key issue is the european baccalaureate , and the certification of schools which want to award the european baccalaureate .
i would also respond to the proposals that the union unilaterally reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 % .
i want to pay tribute , and place on record that tribute , to the huge effort that the committee on international trade and the committee on development have put into the debate on this issue .
i should therefore like to ask if these plans have been completed , if the member states have adopted them and if they are ready to be applied , as the weakest link is very important here , and finally , there is the coordination which you have mentioned ; i am delighted to hear that you are ready to undertake it jointly with the centre for disease prevention and control for this entire influenza story .
after visits to oswiecim , yad vashem or the holocaust museum in washington dc , you are always shocked by the inhumanity of the holocaust perpetrators .
we need a single market that works for europe and in particular for smes , which are the backbone of our economy and the place where most jobs are created .
- ( nl ) madam president , it is good that a number of initiatives have been taken to pay due remembrance to the victims of totalitarian systems .
( ro ) in general , rail transport is safer , faster and causes less pollution than road transport .
the question i would like to ask on this subject is : why is greenland called greenland ?
i should like to think that tomorrow we shall be bold in moving towards more climate protection , and i hope that tomorrow we shall set it in motion .
all my children , sons and daughters , are now grown up , married and have left my home .
this is yet another horrific demonstration of how impossible it is to control nuclear power .
in contrast , as a result of the recent conciliation procedure , a clear , albeit temporary , agreement was reached .
unfortunately , due to the ageing population in europe , more and more people are likely to be affected by this disease in the future .
mrs harms , to be precise , the recovery plan does propose long - term investment , perhaps not enough for your liking , but that is what it proposes , nonetheless .
in actual fact , however , since 1 january 2007 , when mr apsītis took office as ombudsman , he has , in point of fact , never got down to work .
of course we do need a european approach .
the proposal , as we have it from poland and sweden , is good .
the regulation on energy projects constitutes a significant tool to achieve two goals : responding to the key security issues and environmental challenges in the energy sector whilst at the same time contributing to the recovery of our economy .
vice - president of the commission . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the objective of the proposal is to increase the presence on the european market of energy efficient vehicles that produce low levels of pollution , with the aim of reducing both energy consumption and emissions of co 2 and other pollutants .
special mention should be made of the new ratio of funding between the commission and member states , plus the temporary lowering of the threshold for unemployment from 1 000 to 500 .
my personal view is that this eligibility must be applied to all member states .
we must support them bilaterally and multilaterally .
in practice , however , anyone who is found distributing bibles or taking part in secret prayer meetings is liable to be sent off to a labour camp or even executed , according to the testimonies of refugees .
the source of unification is the applicability of international law , in particular , with regard to human rights , throughout the world .
also , implementation of the system provides europe with greater independence , as well as a competitive advantage .
your experience , mr prime minister , as a rebel in one sense , as an intellectual but , most importantly of all , as a democrat and as the voice of reason that could lead your country from the dark ages of communism into the bright lights - sometimes dimmed because of energy crises - and future of the european union , that kind of image and that kind of imagery is what is most important to the people of bosnia , serbia , kosovo and , indeed , turkey .
member of the commission . - the ethical review of research funded under the seventh framework programme is a system that safeguards the protection of fundamental rights and respect for ethical principles .
by the same token , i repeat my proposal to create a european credit rating authority .
in writing . - wilderness can mean different things to different people .
this made it much more difficult to take any measures to mitigate the effects of the disaster .
there has been nothing of this kind available in the past .
member of the commission . - madam president , this is the question on eit private sector funding .
for example , according to the highly regarded mips survey on the overall incidence of environmental pollution , air traffic has its own benefits and would appear to be a solution for the future .
if people think owners do not influence newspapers think again .
madam president , let me start by thanking mrs hedh and mrs bauer for their hard work as co - rapporteurs .
this is a country that achieved independence in 1971 , but has suffered for 20 years under autocratic governments , which have very often been of a military nature .
in fulfilment of its reporting obligation under the directive , the commission will adopt a report in the first half of this year on the directive 's application in all member states and will communicate this to parliament and the council .
the financial crisis and the debt crisis have revealed the gaps in the operation and control of the financial sector today .
i also have something to say about election observers .
however , when illegal immigration results in emergency situations , hardship , crime and insecurity , a tangible strategy for integration at levels that countries can sustain in demographic terms becomes necessary .
mr sarkozy , this is no longer realpolitik , but either blindness or unacceptable cynicism .
we face a situation where christians are being excluded from certain professions because of their faith and hauled before courts because of their faith .
i am calling on the commission to require that the relevant law should be upheld in all member states and to do all it can to ensure that it is implemented .
ladies and gentlemen , on 3 november 1793 , 218 years ago , olympia de gouges was beheaded in europe because she drafted a declaration of the rights of women and female citizens .
the eu agencies europol and eurojust must be strengthened , and the exchange of information between national police authorities improved .
on behalf of the alde group . - madam president , i should like to thank ms gomes for the huge amount of work she has done on this report and her close cooperation with colleagues .
this must be a truly decisive year for our ambition concerning a ' europe of results ' - concrete results for our citizens .
i voted in favour of this report .
we might perhaps consider that the first two or three days could have seen a little more action , but on the whole , i believe that the commissioners carried out their work extremely properly , and that the decisions of the council were such as to give great encouragement within the context of the single european sky to the measures taken on the adoption of functional airspace bloc coordinators and the implementation of the measures by the european aviation safety agency , and many others of these measures were taken quickly .
i hope that other parts of the european union plagued by the phenomenon of secessionist terrorism can look to the irish process and learn lessons from it that will allow them to eradicate violence and construct a society in which everyone can feel that they belong , while respecting the law , traditions and human rights .
the manufacturing rights of the producers of feed must also be safeguarded , as mr mulder said earlier on .
that is precisely where we are heading .
i find that the member states ought to revise their current assistance to target countries , as the 2008 millennium development goals progress chart indicates that sub - saharan africa is the only region lagging seriously behind the progress expected .
some of the most serious social challenges faced by europe , such as the ageing population , require radical innovation that cuts across several sectors .
therefore , i propose a territorial pact with the regions , towns and cities , in addition to the agreement in the council with the member states and the commission .
according to a number of sources , the official death toll is around eighty thousand .
let us contribute to these proposals .
at present , the elected president remains imprisoned in a guest villa .
i also gave the report my support as it seeks to improve harmonisation between the member states in order to prevent legal loopholes that allow businesses to use deceptive advertising practices in the eu member states .
nevertheless , the reasons for which they were imprisoned have not been eliminated .
access to water , which will be one of the main challenges in the years to come , could further delay the achievement of the millennium development goals .
one of the strongest incentives the eu has is being part of the euro area .
resumption of the session
the low level of education of the local population contributes to its belief in supernatural characteristics .
the new mine in kittilä is the biggest in europe with a yearly production of 5 000 kg of gold .
above all , there needs to be greater monitoring of the implementation of bilateral agreements .
of all of the issues we debated this week , this is a crucial one for our consumers , but also our producers .
given that we are supposed to be working together with russia on the partnership for modernisation , and supposed to be negotiating an eu - russia agreement , i find it unbelievable then that only five sentences in the progress report on the partnership for modernisation have been devoted to the modernisation of the rule of law .
the operational programme includes the ' gateway challenge fund ' , which is based on an integrated sustainable development strategy for cork .
there , i would like to be very clear .
this must stop , and to stop it we also need financial resources .
( de ) madam president , i believe that people will forgive me if i answer a question based on a subjective opinion with a subjective opinion of my own .
furthermore , the european investment bank has a clear mandate to support sustainable economic and social development , the integration of developing countries into the world economy , the campaign against poverty , and compliance by these countries with the rule of law , human rights and fundamental rights .
the commission regrets the council 's cut of eur 1.8 billion in payment appropriations .

in 2020 , the target increases to 10 % for renewable transport fuels with a 40 % sub - target for the use of electric and hydrogen cars .
human rights must be reflected in every area of eu foreign policy .
that is one of the european union 's assets .

six years ago , the law on equal opportunities was adopted thanks to the efforts of the lithuanian social democrats and this prohibited any direct or indirect discrimination on the grounds of age , sexual orientation , disability , race or ethnic origin in all areas of life .
we need to have the spirit of 1989 .
then you tell me , commissioner mccreevy , and the rest of the european parliament : yes , i agree with you , but not on hedge funds or private equity .
i agree that local and regional authorities could have a pivotal role in the implementation of these values , and propose a bottom - up approach .
it does not seem to me to be a good idea to acknowledge this negative response , if i can express it like this , by caricaturing china 's current position .

8 .
these are important questions , especially now , when the review of the common agricultural policy is on the horizon .
it was originally proposed for 11 september but , given the tragedy that occurred on that day , parliament voted for it to be on 11 march .
we will not relinquish that future ; thus , we will fight during this parliamentary term to prevent the european project , in which we passionately believe , from being distorted by the confusion between freedom of expression and misrepresentation , and between justice and the manipulation of powers .
we could do the same with the statements published after our european summits .
there are also a few places in parliament 's budget where we would also have liked to have seen savings , but , all in all , we are happy with what we have in front of us now , and i look forward to constructive negotiations with the council .
a policy for fisheries must start from the assumption of an interdependence between the welfare of fishing communities and the sustainability of ecosystems , of which they are an integral part , in particular by recognising the specific features and importance of small - scale inshore fishing and artisanal fishing .
when it comes to integrated maritime policy , we must go beyond the stage of good intentions and give fresh impetus to a strategy that will represent a route to growth and development in the european union , making up for the huge amount of time lost in the prevention of environmental disasters , and in the fight against climate change and pollution .
the drawing up and assessment of scientific studies , independent of the pharmaceutical industry , on the efficacy , safety and risk - benefit ratio of anti - viral vaccines and medicinal products , and on recommended target groups ;
for this reason , i voted in favour of parliament 's proposal , which takes over the commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the consultative working party of the legal services of the european parliament , the council and the commission .
this is a big test of the responsibility of all the institutions - of the european parliament , of the commission and of the european council .
accordingly , the wording we have chosen is more precise and we would ask our fellow members to accept this .
if we applied the same reasoning to other areas , europe would be on the road to ruin .
we cannot exclude the possibility that one consequence of the repression will be expressions of unrest from the tibetans , who will be driven to take extreme measures .
i have one comment about frontex as well : what some member states are doing here is scandalous .
we are certain that these measures will help us to be able to deal with the legitimate concerns , expectations and demands of european citizens .
the ertms specifications have been available since 2000 .
we must and will displace traffic wherever possible , but it is difficult .
there are many important issues outlined in the resolution , such as the preservation of kosovo 's cultural heritage , the improvement of public administration capacity , the better integration of all communities in kosovo , the necessity for multi - ethnic education and the plight of roma families in lead - contaminated refugee camps in the north .
i therefore fully support changes aimed at the effective and rapid mobilisation of resources .
i am therefore concerned , for example , about the planned regulatory activities of the commission in the area of concessions on services .
once again , i think the answer is no.
and in order to do so , he said , we must invest in people , in growth , in jobs , in energy security , in fighting climate change and in giving consumers a fairer deal .
otherwise , we will be forced to feel ashamed when we face the next generation .
safety of workers and the flexibility required by businesses are extremely important ; that is why , today , the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats - which is based on these foundations of equal treatment , on access to vocational training , and on the procedures for representing temporary workers in accordance with collective agreements - has sought to make progress with this work , too , and reach a consensus .

in reply to question 3 , in which the honourable members ask why access to social housing is limited to households with an income of less than eur 33 000 , i would like , here again , to be very clear .
drought events have therefore become more frequent over the last 30 years , costing more than eur 100 billion so far .
to give support to voluntary work and enhance social recognition , it is important that a community of purpose is created , with transfer of best practice and experience by the active players - government , business , trade unions and voluntary organisations - working together in dialogue and in partnership .
some of these points have been addressed to a certain extent . i myself ...
i believe that the report that has emerged from the committee on economic and monetary affairs , under the stewardship of mr rasmussen , reflects these concerns .
all other elements of the tax package before us serve this same purpose .
it is my intention to achieve a political agreement in the council this week .
this is a good signal .
i welcome the compromise contained in amendment 107 , mainly because it improves the guarantee for patients in cross - border healthcare provision , and stresses the positive trend towards greater patient awareness .
if the conference of presidents proposes a change in the procedure to the bureau , the bureau will consider it with all due care .
effective spectrum use must be promoted in the eu in order to satisfy the growing need for radio frequencies , and mobile broadband capacity must be increased , ensuring better opportunities for the public and commercial sector .
however , it must never be the size of someone 's purse that governs when they receive health care , and decisions on healthcare must be taken close to the patients , not by bureaucrats in the eu system .
in addition to issues that relate to the river itself , such as improving the water quality and the ecological situation , the programme that the commission is to draw up could also result in economic and administration - related synergies .
secondly , we need an emergency ' central and eastern europe gas infrastructure ' plan , with the money that is available .
the differences in pay between women and men is ultimately yet another indication of the continued discrimination against women in all of the different areas .
this is unacceptable and the european union cannot afford to be silent .
as for the rest , i believe that we must , of course , develop rail transport .
i would like to draw attention to the fact that the directive on maternity leave , which was rejected by the member states , ought to be reviewed as a matter of urgency , not to mention the uncertain outlook for the anti - discrimination directive , which is still blocked in the council .
however , the area where we still have work to do is that of the installation and use of construction products .
yet this is done with the employee 's consent , and for additional payment , of course , and not just automatically every week .
this scientific and technological association agreement will help to structure and improve cooperation on these matters between the eu and the faroes , through regular meetings of its joint committee , in which specific cooperation activities can be planned .
in writing . - ( fr ) toys have to be safer than other products because children are very vulnerable consumers .
european integration has built on a set of fundamental values that are constantly being extended .
the commission has considered the security risk that this category of people represents for the community , as well as the fact that there has , as yet , been no dialogue on the subject of visa liberalisation with kosovo .
the euro clique , removed from reality as they are , thought they were just going to get a little bit more money for their own hobbies .
i believe that instead , we should be more concerned with certain judgments handed down by the court of justice in luxembourg that open up breaches in the united front of the west against terrorism , or to refer to it by its proper name - islamic terrorism - and be very careful of legal political correctness .
to answer these two questions , i cannot agree with you more .
this comprehensive report contains a number of ideas which should be more than pious wishes .
i agree that it should not be possible for the fine to exceed 0.2 % of gross domestic product .

this fact alone underlines the importance of farming to the eu 's natural environment .
we should do that before we try to regulate centrally how the social partners should behave in 27 different countries .
when the balance of payments facility is used , however , one should not equate - and it seems to me , from what i understood , that in some of the speeches you were trying to do so - a utilisation of budget resources ( structural funds , cohesion fund , programme of another type , aid ) with a loan to solve a financial problem in a country .
the very aim of the proposal for a directive as regards information to the general public on medicinal products subject to medical prescription is to provide simple information that is easy to understand and use , but that avoids forms of advertising .

the group of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe has requested that a debate be held on the situation concerning ai weiwei in china , and that it be included in the debates held pursuant to rule 122 of the rules of procedure on thursday afternoon , instead of the debate on zimbabwe previously intended for this time .
mr solana , in the british guardian newspaper , robert cooper , a member of your staff , is quoted as saying the following in connection with the recently mooted manifesto for a new nato : ' maybe we are going to use nuclear weapons before anyone else , but i 'd be wary of saying it out loud ' .

you asked another question which is of real concern to me and which is , in my opinion , an essential subject for debate .
the central axis of this reform must include certain key ideas , such as the importance of the rural world 's viability , the need to prevent the disappearance of european agriculture , farmers ' incomes , the need to bring into this market young entrepreneurs and creative models of production and management , and also consumers ' interests , which , even though we are all consumers , are very often not vigorously represented .
i would like to thank the three questioners very much for presenting in detail the considerations which led them to formulating the questions .
in this case , that means seeking to adopt any measures that reduce the aforementioned impact , not preventing it from happening , as that is clearly impossible .

balance must be ensured by appropriate regulations standardising procedures and promoting agreement between interested parties .
( pt ) our rapporteur , and in this case also the european commission , deserve all our congratulations .
my second point is that it must be a developmental budget , not one that will fund micro - programmes and modest priorities .
firstly , it will simplify the process of combating fraud and abuse , as biometric identifiers make forging visas more difficult .

the lisbon strategy , viewed in a positive light by the rapporteur , opens our economies up to unfair competition , particularly from communist china , which practises true social dumping .

the stabilisation of the euro area is of strategic importance , and i believe that europe must include measures to strengthen it , increasing its economic governance in light of the objectives to be pursued by the eu 2020 strategy .
as mr lehne has just mentioned , the presence of the presidency on a monday bears witness to the importance of the issue .

local authorities are already doing a great deal here and they should continue to do so .
although our high representatives in the european union are not in a position or are not prepared to support and encourage those people who are fighting for democracy , it is good at least to be able to take action and provide help , even if we are not talking .

we are certainly in a situation at the moment where many voices are protesting and making accusations that the alleged intention is to carry out a military occupation under the guise of humanitarian assistance .
once again , at the summit , the 27 member states showed themselves to be very adept at horse - trading .

this means that it will help save 20 % of energy consumption through increased energy efficiency .
( pl ) mr president , i hope that the milk producers now have the worst behind them .
the council draft decision on the stepping up of cross - border cooperation , particularly in combating terrorism and cross - border crime - the well known ' prüm ' decision - on which the council reached political agreement in june 2007 , represents considerable progress on the implementation of the principle of availability and the strengthening of cross - border police cooperation , in particular by means of joint operations and the provision of assistance for mass events , disasters and serious accidents .

just yesterday , moody 's again downgraded greece 's credit reason for no good reason .
i believe that she has done a very good job .
in spite of this , talks should be conducted with this country and the agreement should be signed .
i hope there is a chance , because - as i said earlier - there are journalists who have been admitted now , so hopefully our european community will be there .
making it possible to use meal in animal husbandry will reduce production costs , which is extremely important in view of the drop in profitability of meat production .
there have been a number of incidents in hungary , but the problem is not limited to that country , where the economic crisis and the social problems perhaps explain the renewed increase in attacks on roma .
so far , this programme has not exactly lived up to its promise .
( applause )

secondly , all possibilities for constructing the southern gas corridor have been included , in other words , in addition to the nabucco project , the south stream and tgi projects are also noted .
at the social level , the presidency will first have the difficult task of getting things moving again on two emblematic draft directives , one on working time and the sadly famous opt - out , and the other on temporary work and equal treatment of employees .
as regards combating climate change , notably the carbon dioxide issue , we do not wish the cost of this effort to represent an undue burden on the economies of the new member states .
now that the euphoria is gone , today it seems clear that the protagonists of the orange revolution were not up to the challenge .
however , most of you do not know that in prague i ride an electric bicycle .
what are ridiculous are interventions such as yours .
we should note in this chamber today that the commission on our behalf did not have the confidence that they could do an independent , fair and objective job and therefore we have proper reason to say that we have no confidence in the election results .
the wide variety of subjects raised , the strength of the proposals made , and your reactions too , are in keeping with the crucial nature of matters that brings us together today .
i am very sceptical about using a debate on multilingualism and on the promotion of language as a sort of cover , or proxy , or political bargaining tool for the various national issues in all our member states , and that appears to have happened in relation to some of the debate on this at committee and here .

on behalf of the verts / ale group . - ( de ) madam president , commissioner , these discussions are taking place in unfavourable circumstances .
i abstained , despite the fact that the motion for a resolution contains positive elements , because important amendments tabled by the confederal group of the european united left - nordic green left were voted down and , as a result , the content was inadequate .
the photographs and films emerging from darfur , which have moved viewers around the world , cannot truly reflect the crisis facing people in this region , who are trying to emigrate to nearby chad , as well as to other countries and continents , including egypt , israel , the united states , canada and europe .
in so doing , the new forms of regional cooperation could genuinely support the process of developing real multi - level governance .

the governments of both countries need to explain now all the reasons to those who are sceptical and who changed before our very eyes from being former allies supporting bulgarian and romanian integration to instigators of the waiting game .
at the lighting of the olympic flame in athens - just like a year ago in his speech at tiananmen square - mr rogge has once again failed to make any reference whatsoever to the current situation .
that is why it is so important for the eu to get to the heart of the emissions problem , i.e. the actual increases in emissions .
that is the reality with which we are confronted .
these are all necessary , but inadequate , measures .
ladies and gentlemen , we are not amateurs or volunteers !
the british conservatives are a recipe for disaster for britain and for europe .
that is why i am asking the commission to ensure that the member states assume their responsibilities , for once and for all .

or , consider our research policy : if we want to encourage our european talent in a different way and invest more in intelligence and education , then that needs to be reflected in the next financial perspective .

illegal timber is pouring into the eu , and this in itself is completely absurd .
it is not acceptable , either , that improvement in the quality of health care should be achieved by making treatment providers compete , or to argue the principle of the free movement of patients : the latter depends above all on their state of health .

as a french politician , i worked on an environmental safety initiative in europe .
yemen is an extremely significant country , in particular , because of its geographical location .
in writing . - ( fr ) until such time as the crazy challenge of space solar energy becomes a reality and the entire world reaps the benefits of this almost inexhaustible electric manna , the european union has no other choice for its current energy policy than to get its energy supply from as many sources as possible and to opt for energy efficiency .
these are important elements in alleviating the consequences of the economic crisis .
like many speakers , i have some doubts as to the appropriateness of an ep resolution shortly before their local elections , and my group , the ecr group , has submitted a number of amendments to make the resolution more balanced and less repetitive .
i cannot but notice , however , a certain absurdity .
then we must consider the fact that by favouring exports from producer businesses , we are actually helping those areas of pakistan which have not been flooded , whereas our aid should serve to build competitiveness and development , helping the recovery of production in the areas of the country that have been hit by the catastrophe .
the internet is a wonderful tool , a wonderful source of information for all of us and something that will be part of our lives into the future .

we need sustainable instruments now , so that the european union can meet the challenges of the immediate future with democratic legitimacy , as the chair of the committee on budgets , mr lamassoure , has just called for on behalf of all of us .
i consider the application of this type of assistance to projects in the field of energy essential , especially in a time of crisis , as it stimulates the european economy by creating new jobs .
i believe that the allocations for the cohesion funds must be kept as they play a fundamental role in reducing the disparities in economic development between the eu 's regions .
that is why i would like the commission to make a statement and undertake to reconsider its proposal .

i believe that such a proposal was long overdue .
yes , new standards should only be adopted if they are useful and necessary , after a careful cost - benefit analysis .
i would like to emphasise that the spanish presidency 's priorities must also include relations with the eastern partnership states .
this is not the case in the european union at present , and we are conscious of a growing danger .
i believe it is in this context that we may find divisions of labour , applications of joint expertise and the necessary mechanisms of cooperation , including common standards , which you have called for .
based on this assessment , the council should consider extending its mandate for as long as required .
should we not spend our time instead on together preventing fish and shellfish being fished during their breeding periods in general , on ensuring that animals , plants and seas remain viable food providers long into the future , on giving the animals that we eat a reasonable life for their species before they are humanely slaughtered ?
democracy depends on the public being informed .

i therefore approve of the rapporteur 's proposal to increase the participation of industrial groups and small and medium - sized enterprises .
no one , least of all the eu council and commission , can continue to neglect the fight for freedoms and human rights in china .
clearly this is just one stage .
for these reasons , the approach that i took , supported by our shadows , in formulating parliament 's position , was to strongly support the aim of improving the completeness , relevance and comparability of the statistics on offer in this field , bringing the statistics more up to date with new trends in the tourism sector to reflect , for instance , the increase in internet bookings and in short - stay trips .
it took five years for the member states to implement this .

promoting transparency of data with an interactive online database increases awareness of standards , enables problems to be resolved faster and increases trust in operators .
the first is your decision to revise universal jurisdiction , since this weakens us when faced with genocide and universal criminals , whether they be in israel , china or guatemala , and the second is where , in cases such as the sahara or columbia , for example , among many others , trade agreements take precedence over the defence of human rights .
the aim of this would be real convergence , promotion of each country 's potential , the sustainable use of its resources , investment in production and the creation of jobs with rights .

on behalf of the european parliament , i would like to send a message of solidarity to the victims of hurricane gustav in the caribbean .
on this subject , i think that in our hearts we can all accept having a transition period for the economies that have the most coal , given that we know how complicated transitions are from a social point of view .
indeed , we still have much to do in this area .
this is already a hidden subsidy which has contributed to making it possible for european fisheries to go on fishing depleted fish stocks ; and the segments in the fisheries sector which have the highest consumption of fossil fuels are , in fact , the most destructive ones , such as beam trawlers and bottom trawlers .
all the major economic powers , along with emerging nations like china , are rushing to get their hands on these resources which are becoming increasingly rare .
there is only one problem : we have a torrent of illegality which necessarily means lives destroyed and even worse destruction , not just in italy , and what i therefore hope , commissioner , is that the commission will bear in mind that there we have the proof that italy , as in the 1920s , is taking a new and different path , is becoming a threat to the whole of our europe , that country which ( . . . ) .
i strongly support this message to the council .
i also support the idea of community funding referred to in amendment 6 , which relates to recital 5 .

whatever decision is made , however , it should be made quickly so that the eit can start work soon .
what we want is for romania 's financial , military and human contribution to the european and international effort to result in long - term stability in afghanistan and the elimination of terrorist hot spots .

the support that is needed for the car industry indeed represents failing industrial policy .
in particular , the recent food crisis has shown that food is not just any raw material .
macedonia 's progress , first and foremost , depends on macedonia itself , but the eu should not shut the door in its face for political reasons like the dispute over its name .
it is no great surprise then that , spurred on by the economic and social crisis , the protests in tunisia have turned into a tidal wave capable of having a heavy impact on the existing power structure .
mr president , as shadow rapporteur on the recast of the dublin regulation , i wish to thank the european commission for the quality of the text proposed to us .
( sv ) madam president , the most important task facing european politicians in the years ahead is to safeguard employment and welfare .
i believe that the revision the commission placed before parliament , on which we subsequently voted in committee and the first reading of which was deferred in march of this year , did not go far enough , and i know we have a difference of opinion on this .
what we have now is merely an adjustment .
the debate is closed .
finally , someone said that we should make the stockholm programme more tangible .
this is most important , since flexicurity only makes sense if it ushers in an atmosphere of trust between employees and employers .
banks are not being placed under any obligation .
i voted in favour of this document , because it is being increasingly recognised across the board that fisheries management has to be based on up - to - date accurate scientific knowledge of stock status .
as a result , market power would be concentrated in the hands of a few of the largest entities that will then be able to bypass the network of bilateral agreements and grant licences to the whole european market .
i hope that the igc can be able to examine the question with sufficient care .
since , on both the supply and demand sides , the reasons cited for higher food prices are structural in nature , prices and price increases can be expected , in the long term as well , to remain at a level higher than that to which we have become accustomed in the past decade .
lastly , in the financial field , we welcome the will to impose rules and to act forcefully with regard to both supervision and taxation .
if we do not have this strategy , it will make no difference whether or not we speak with one voice , because our words will be meaningless .
some of these proposals have already been adopted here in this parliament and by the council .
corrigendum ( rule 204a ) : see minutes
what we need today is not dreams , but concrete actions to save the european economy from decline .
headlined ' czechs with few mates ' , it explains how the czech republic , in its three years of eu membership , has earned a reputation for promoting human rights at every turn .
they have proved adequately flexible during the current crisis , enabling us to take into account the difficult financial situation faced by some companies , as mentioned by some of you .
in writing . - ( it ) the new european stability mechanism requires an amendment to the treaty of lisbon , to ensure its legally valid inclusion within the institutional framework of the european union .
they must also take action themselves to eliminate the many abuses in their communities .
the russians will recognise the consequences of our taking resolute action and not simply being driven by their agenda .
if you look at the many initiatives proposed by the commission so far , you will see that there is not a single case in which the commission has proposed lowering a standard or weakening the level of european integration that has been achieved .
( the president cut off the speaker )
mr demetriou , you mentioned the scourge that terrorism represents , and which we need to combat .
mr president , i would like to thank commissioner dimas for his answer .
without a free and independent justice system , there can be no rule of law , human rights are not guaranteed , and there is no foreign investment or progress .
when i make decisions i think of them , i think of their social rights , which i believe to be fundamental in europe .
we have these epochal events - this economic crisis on our border , this collapse in our share of world gdp - and here we are talking about early years learning , about our responsibilities to the international labour organisation , and about whether sarajevo should be a european city of culture .
i think that the right of marriage partners to choose by mutual agreement the competent court and jurisdiction would also help them discover the content in both cases .
it is a compromise , but it is going in the right direction .
it is necessary because excessively high tariffs are raising obstacles preventing the freedom of movement and communication between europe 's citizens .
the european community must set an appropriate and binding deadline regarding the use of sepa instruments , after which all euro payments must be made using the norms of this system .
that means , in reality , that the african union must become a more responsible and responsive organisation with genuine moral and political authority .
he is threatening and punishing journalists in venezuela because they do not support his autocratic regime .
we must review the conditions necessary for any signing of agreements on the movement of persons involving readmission agreements , so that we respect human rights .
without its commitment and its willingness to find ways forward we would never have been able to reach an agreement .
sexual violence is being used as a tool for oppressing women and for silencing them , for example , in cairo , where women have been abused and subjected to virginity tests by the military .
the commission has also announced that it will submit a proposal in 2011 for a strategic plan to combat gender - based violence .
a reduction in vat or excise duty is not an immediately obvious solution , which is understandable , as it might encourage the oil producers to charge even higher prices .
author . - mr president , i think all of us would want to express our condolences to the family and friends of salmaan taseer , the governor of punjab put in place by the government of pakistan , and we are remembering here today his clear support for asia bibi - a position he knew to be controversial and indeed dangerous .
the example of italy is fresh in our minds .
as always ( as before ) , greater attention should also be devoted to regions lagging behind .
( es ) atlético madrid , its fans and even the spanish police are being mistreated by the union of european football associations .
statement by the president
considering the challenges posed by climate change , our high dependency on fossil fuels and the growing challenge of creating rural jobs , the european union needs a clear , easy - to - follow regulatory system enabling it to operate effectively as regards renewable energy production , and especially as regards biomass production .
thirdly , humanising the debate about the victims , who are people who are suffering and need to be protected , defended , recognised , helped and supported .
i should also like to express my wish that our irish friends propose a road map to the european council that is at once realistic and ambitious and provides a timetable for ending the institutional impasse .
mr president , i would first of all like to thank those meps who have voiced their initial reactions .
in this report we therefore call for auctioning of emission permits , we demand an emissions cap which is consistent with the reduction target of 30 % , and restrictions and tough requirements for the use of flexible mechanisms .
hence our proposal to reject this directive .
above all , our message must be clear and must be contained in a simple , understandable , comprehensible procedure which , if nothing else , functions for everyone , functions for the citizens , functions for parliament , for the union 's institutions , for the member states and for all stakeholders in the procedure .
i wanted to raise another issue , however , i recalled during the discussion when mrs ferrero - waldner visited the israeli government during the terrible bloodshed of the gaza war .
the war in bosnia destroyed more than 75 % of the country , caused the death of more than 200 000 people and resulted in 1.8 million refugees .
mr president , the opinion that the european parliament will vote now on the commission 's proposal for a directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation does not prejudice the final position that the parliament will take with regard to the implementation of article 291 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union and the consequences for the procedures based on council decision 1999/468 / ec of 28 june 1999 , especially as regards the regulatory procedure with scrutiny or the position that the parliament may wish to take on delegated acts in other legislation .
these proposals aim to supplement this compromise on the most sensitive issues such as : liberalisation of planting rights ; grubbing - up of vines ; addition of sugar and must aid ; maintenance of potable alcohol , which is so important for some prestige wines such as port , the competitiveness of which must be guaranteed ; crisis prevention ; promotion and so on .
the truth , then , is that the council has handed yet more powers over to the eu , including powers over the uk economy , which is the single most important issue to the british people today .
with regard to the fight against direct or indirect discrimination on the basis of gender , that policy has proved a complete success in the european union .
( de ) mr president , the report contains good innovations .
in employment terms , the jobs of around 100 000 miners could be at stake ; they may be unable to find jobs in other sectors as quickly as is necessary and they run the risk of becoming long - term unemployed .
all these measures , together with member states acting in a coordinated and consistent manner , will show a european union addressing the real problems .
the current romanian government has stipulated that this is a zero priority measure and the facilities which have been approved mean that this priority is already guaranteed .
we therefore hope , as i have said , that this work will be concluded , that the report will be published and that any recommendations made by this troika will also be made known to us .
the fact that cameroon is africa 's leading exporter of hardwood to europe makes it necessary to regulate the flow of goods through the partnership agreement on which we are voting today .
it was also interesting to see how mr kirkhope turned in his seat , because the tories are so close to this peculiar party in their views on european policy .
after the second world war , when europe slowly came to accept that the independence of african countries was eventually inevitable , kenya was emphatically excluded , as was the country we now know as zimbabwe .
we do have those institutions now , within and outside the european union - a small number of institutions that can cooperate together .
this report proposes greater civilian - military cooperation in terms of pooling efforts for cbrn disaster prevention , detection , preparation and response .
in order for there to be proper vertical and horizontal cooperation , procedures must be streamlined , and more money spent on the training of specialists from implementing bodies in the individual member states .
the student scene is fairly lively .
the study on volunteering in sport : a very important topic .
delivery will require a collective effort by all stakeholders at all levels .
we are only meant to have two minutes .
president - in - office of the council . - ( fr ) i will be perfectly frank with mr ó neachtain : given the items which will already be on the agenda for the european council in december , i do not think that this question will be raised at the european council , despite the challenge which it represents .
this is a very exciting subject which i believe we do not talk about enough these days .
that is the inherent position , which is why we are rejecting the compromise .
that is the reality in europe .
secondly , the trade and cooperation agreement must be used as a very useful instrument to encourage internal reforms that bring iraq closer to multilateral system disciplines .
cohesion policy is the second pillar on which this growth must rely , a sustainable , intelligent and inclusive growth .
( fr ) mr president , i would simply like to ask mr gollnisch what he believes the outcome of the election signifies and whether it means that mr ouattara 's victory must ultimately result in him taking power .
only when member states show true solidarity will there be a comprehensive common security and defence policy .
we are far too dependent on third countries for our feed and need to begin cultivating more ourselves .
when that happens , we must preserve the rule of law .
we will keep on being in the lead .
for this very reason , this proposal aims to provide the member states with a legal framework enabling them to more effectively resolve the potential negative effects of mine closures that could occur as a result of the gradual withdrawal of subsidies , in particular , the social and environmental effects .
you will not solve the crucial problems facing europe through your legal subterfuges or by letting yourselves be guided by the judgments of the european court of justice .
i would stress that we are talking about international waters here and that lene espersen , the danish foreign minister , has also emphatically said that this is unacceptable .
what is more , the technology used by electric vehicles is the most efficient and best for the environment .
( fr ) mr president , as far as the group of the greens / european free alliance is concerned , cohesion policy is at the heart of one of the most fundamental policies of the european union : solidarity .
to this end , within the framework of the 2009 call for proposals , eur 250 million was allocated for the ertms , part of which will be used specifically to update the relevant computer programs .
i noticed very carefully how it was done .
however , i would like to emphasise that this will not end the debate on the future of the dairy sector in the european union .
what i have presented represents , in my view , the limits of flexibility in addressing the short - term crisis , with a view to putting in place a medium - and longer - term perspective of restructuring , in order to regain sustainability of resources and the profitability of the sector .
i think that quotas will not solve the problem of the lack of women scientists if women themselves do not wish to change this status quo .
i cannot go to all of them .
( es ) madam president , in the current crisis situation , the laudable efforts of the french presidency and the industry commissioner , mr verheugen , should be congratulated .
the union 's financial help reflects the strategic importance of ukraine as a potential candidate for eu membership .
member of the commission . - mr president , honourable members , you asked me to come to the plenary to explain where we are in the negotiations on acta - the international anti - counterfeiting trade agreement .
in these times of crisis , one cannot ' play ' with european taxpayers ' money for the sake of politically sensitive issues .
the agreement states that europe will develop its own system for the collection and sorting of bank details .
however , chinese authorities have not heeded international calls to stop pursuing their follow - up to the riots of 14 march 2008 in tibet .
before suspending the sitting for a couple of minutes until the arrival of our guests , i wish to welcome a delegation from the syrian parliament , led by mr suleiman haddad , chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the syrian people 's assembly , which is here as part of our 10th ep / syria interparliamentary meeting .
despite this , i have voted against the resolution , because we received it yesterday as a finished text and were not able to debate it seriously and because the devil is in the detail .
i want to keep the tried and tested community method - with the commission as guardian and judge of common european interests - from which the exclusive right of legislative initiative stems .
ten years on , we still have a lot to do .
ladies and gentlemen , on 13 april ennaama asfari , a human rights defender in the western sahara , was arrested in marrakech .
this debate showed up many national differences , and there was no honesty in the debate at all .
we know who they are .
yet , like it or not , it is the responsibility of the eu and the 27 member states to take action , bearing in mind the overriding priority of international solidarity and the protection of human rights .
we are sceptical about these proposals .
the discussion that has taken place to date has involved the trade unions far too little , and ngos and churches have been similarly excluded .
finally , i wish to congratulate the rapporteur .
however , you were the one who had to take on this presidency , and i congratulate you and all the ministers of the present government .
at present large volumes of young cod that have just arrived in the baltic sea are being dumped .
as early as 1998 , when the ejn was established , a secure telecommunications network was envisaged , but it has been impossible , so far , to agree on the modalities , apparently on grounds of cost .
i also welcome the fact that the legislator has allowed the member states to include provisions that are more favourable to consumers in their respective national legal systems .
( the president cut off the speaker )
there is no stability without solidarity .
as far as i see it , the main merit of the resolution on health care systems in sub - saharan africa and global health is that it tackles the issue on the basis of the specific features of the region in question .
therefore , as highlighted in your resolution , this semester will be crucial for croatia 's negotiating process .
the purpose of this is to construct a scheme to create billions , fantasy financial assets at the service of a system that appears to have learnt nothing from the crisis in which it is currently embroiled .
turning now to regions where healthcare is cheap and to those where waiting times are short . eventually , they will have so many health tourists coming in that their own local patients will be squeezed out .
these two european citizens are acting on our behalf , too ; they are acting to make up for our political failure .
in this context , we must also examine the measures required to ensure that the european banking system can finance the european economy , especially small and medium - sized enterprises .
you should read the agreement !
i would like to end by reiterating the position which i also expressed during the january plenary , namely , that dialogue on human rights is an instrument which has proved to be ineffective and inadequate .
i therefore think that consideration really should be given to this and i welcome the fact that the commission is thinking about amending the provisions of council regulation ( ec ) no 1/2003 in this area with regard to criteria and other types of sanctions , making the provisions more specific and laying down tougher criteria including in relation to the penalty measures to be laid down .
there are technologies that do meet all of these requirements , meaning that x - rays , radiographs and naked images must be outmoded , which is where we are going wrong at the moment .
we are especially interested in promoting and analysing its link with european associations for innovation within the eu framework for innovation .
the chances of getting money back in this way are negligible .
this will really help increase consumers ' rights and therefore also help us move towards completion of the single market .
the proposal to remove the requirement of disclosing formation expenses also seems justified .
let us not forget that the member states were not unanimous on this agreement either .
many fellow members have emphasised that the continuation of such differences is unacceptable from the perspective of equal rights .
president - in - office , tell me how on earth i can tell 500 million european citizens that we are selling out on important safeguards and principles just because we are not able to put our foot down , because council is not able to get its act together .
now mrs wortmann - kool , who has left , spoke about the obstacles to the internal market and mr jarzembowski , despite his report on the greening of transport , also expressed reservations about the eurovignette .
although social protection falls under the competence of the member states , the lack of harmonisation is clearly damaging the internal market .
i agree with the assessment that public procurement , as a highly important part of the european market , should remain a tool for promoting environmentally friendly vehicles , but this should not be done in a mechanical way .
we should respond as europeans .
finally , i should like to point out that creating this new category will not involve any additional expenditure , thanks to the savings expected by several regions no longer being under objective 1 .
things have been done .
i wish to end by saying that the european parliament will be a permanent partner in the process of developing and implementing the eu strategy for the danube region .
i would like to observe that cohesion policy is not very visible in rural areas , despite the declarations which have been made on this matter .
the latest results show we are on the right track but that , if we take account of the effect of debt cancellation in certain countries , the current good results are quite relative .
another source of concern is the current military offensive against the karen populations in the east of the country , where the biggest military operation in a decade has taken place .
that shows things have progressed , there is a greater awareness .
this is an extremely important issue which goes to the heart of the member states ' sovereignty and also the ownership and management of the right to exploit a natural resource , in other words the transfer to private interests of rights to exploit a public asset .
all i can say to you is that our intention is entirely the opposite .
social reality stocktaking ( debate )
gender - related violence , whether committed in the home or armed conflict zones , is one of the most serious human rights violations and must be opposed and punished accordingly .
in addition , artistic activity can be useful for technological research and development and in turn is influenced by it .
the next item is the joint debate on
these should include a requirement for greater media freedom .
i think your proposals are a move in the right direction .
this would fulfil all the strategic and economic requirements contained in decision 1364/2006 / ec .
a well - functioning system for standard - setting is vital for the european economy as a whole and , in particular , for the information and communication technology sector .
then , and only then , would we have the money available to help the poorer regions around the black sea .
for our group , the basic point here is the balance between security and freedom .
however , as regards other matters , i think that we will make progress in the ongoing talks .
you have failed to say it again today .
the eri will be used for the experimental study , mainly using inductive methods , of phenomena in the world around us , with the aim of producing practical solutions .
by sadc standards , even the parliamentary elections of 29 march were neither free nor fair .
the procedures must protect consumers from the danger of unhealthy food and from being misled .
one possible route is self - regulation , by which i mean that the producers of mobile phones and hence of chargers can agree very swiftly to impose a standard that puts an end to this truly ridiculous and damaging situation .
not only that , but it is also detrimental , not only for our country - my country - but also for the other countries of the union .
we are talking here about the road haulage sector , a sector that has made it possible to achieve a 40 % rise in economic exchange between the eu member states in the last five years .
if you want a fundamental change , you need to put forward an integrated plan for all means of transport - and that is something we made very clear in the committee .
the fact is , people are already getting used to the situation .
i would like to call on mrs geoghegan - quinn to evaluate the study which is being drawn up very carefully .
is it the lack of prospects , or the general insecurity surrounding the profession ?
( fr ) mr president , for the last time , is mr madlener aware , when he argues against european solidarity and against greece , that , after germany , the netherlands is the second largest beneficiary of the european internal market and that practically one out of every two jobs in the netherlands is linked to activities relating to the export of goods and services to the european union ?
nuclear power is a source of energy which we cannot give up just like that , because it provides a large part of our energy and contributes to our reduction in co 2 emissions .
why are there double standards ?
it would be good , and we would have enough time , if this were not the external reality .
it is too premature to speculate about the names yet .
i share the commission 's opinion on the need for coordinated efforts and for linking the short - term commitments and efforts with the long - term commitments .
systematic and rigorous monitoring of the compatibility of european legislation with the charter of fundamental rights must be guaranteed .
whilst the progress made in the area of gender equality is unquestionable , major challenges remain .
an africa that is at ease , courted by multiple partners offering for the first time , and indeed the first time in a long while , promising perspectives for growth , will clearly wish to be treated as an equal .
the law on the use of special intelligence lays down a purpose limitation , stipulating that these measures can only be used for the purpose of fighting organised crime or for protecting national security .
and , even in those countries that chose the ccctb , no companies would be forced to use it , because there would be no sense in forcing companies that are not operating in the internal market - that are not doing business in the internal market - to use this common tax base .
and we have heard their plans this week : how they are going to cut public services and to increase pension ages , and how they will help the wealthy by cutting inheritance tax . once again they are fighting like rats in a sack , as we say in the uk , over europe .
vice - president of the commission . - mr president , i start my concluding remarks by thanking once again mrs giannakou for her report because i think that this debate has very clearly proven that the concern and the issues she raised in her report are legitimate ; they are at the heart of european integration and of its democratic nature .
( applause )
if they did n't see it as a benefit , would they just not pay the contributions - after all , no one really knows she is helping her husband - and is this not what married people do , help each other ?
during the autumn , the presidency also organised a conference in brussels on victims of people - trafficking , with the aim of highlighting the need for measures to be taken for those affected and the focus on cooperation with countries of origin for human trafficking .
in tackling the issue of fundamental rights in the eu today we must not , however , omit to refer to the terrible events in gaza .
( sv ) mr president , it is the task of the european court of justice to issue judgments in line with the treaties .
i met the belarusian ambassador in london , who reassured me that this time it would all be different , that it would be up to international standards , and that the osce would be able to say that it was fair and free .
it is always the children who suffer most .
this is the reason why i am asking the commission to deal with this matter with maximum accountability and present a vision for drafting an innovation action plan for the future .
regarding that as an essential criterion , together with the corresponding controls , will also lead to success .
it is true that a major step was taken with the appointment , under the lisbon treaty , of an eu high representative for foreign affairs .
( cs ) the history of the enlargement of the schengen area is marked by double standards .
i have reservations about the proposal that sanctions against producers who fail to reduce the co 2 emissions of vans should be higher than sanctions for failing to reduce emissions from cars .
there are numerous benefits to this .
hence my support for the points contained in the report , namely : that there should be clear definitions relating not only to the scope , but also to the different actors in the supply chain , in order to clarify their roles and responsibilities ; that sanctions should be equivalent to those applied for illegal acts involving narcotics ; and that there should be enhanced transparency and regulation of medicine sales on the internet , thereby enabling consumers to distinguish between illegal operators and online pharmacies .
the penalties vary with regard to their type and category of seriousness and with regard to the level of fines .
but negotiations on our common steps at expert level are , to date , not finished .
( de ) mr president , in two days ' time , we will be debating the question of body scanners .
furthermore , men and women who stay home for long periods of time to take care of the elderly or young children often lose out economically because they do n't have an income and their work is not factored into the gdp even though it is important work .
the ratio of clearance to new forest growth is even higher than 100 % .
the proposal is to maintain the supply of this product , which is used for local consumption in small quantities of 800 tonnes per year .
i hope that further , similar steps will allow us to unblock negotiations on the proposal and proceed with its adoption .
i think we should be adamant about that .
all that was needed in plenary , therefore , was to ratify a consensual decision .
particularly during economically uncertain times , it is important to be able to rely on commitments made in this regard .
finally , we must take into account the imbalances produced in the marketing chain , the importance of relying on sectoral marketing standards and the need to draw up eu guidelines for best practice for the operation of the systems related to agricultural product quality and their mutual recognition .
recognising the specific challenges that await us in 2009 , we cannot at the same time exempt ourselves from the duty of frugal management of european taxpayers ' money , i.e. from certain self - imposed restrictions which we shall also expect from other european institutions .
it is significant that in the exceptionally fragmented and often contradictory hungarian political arena a sweeping majority voted in favour of ratification .
it is impossible not to sympathise with the emotion felt by this mother courage at the sight of these people , oppressed and humiliated to an intolerable degree , forcing their way through the blockade imposed by israel and finally breathing fresh air , with time to find milk for the children , food for the family and a little happiness to bolster their morale .
it will benefit fellow members here in parliament who receive extortionate fines for expressing their opinions freely and who have nowhere to go to appeal against this .
the border protection agency frontex plays an important role when it comes to combating illegal immigration .
the low turn - out at the eu elections speaks volumes .
requiring member sates to accept electronically submitted vat returns will also significantly simplify the process .
without our support , this small agricultural holding could not stay in existence .
it is important to remember this .
these processes make it all the more urgent to create a common european energy policy based on solidarity .
lastly , israel is not a special case .
as far as you are concerned , the spanish presidency and the commission have violated the treaty of lisbon because the european parliament has been left out .
the people who live on the islands in this part of the indian ocean are very poor , face the problem of unemployment and , as the rapporteur himself writes , are , in practice , dependent on financial help from abroad .
on 20 december , it will have its visa requirement lifted and , a short while ago , we had elections in greece .
yet the uncertainty being created at the moment by the confidentiality of the negotiating documents has given rise to many rumours .
why not ?
i am saying what i think : this directive is also from another era , from before the crisis .
presentation of the programme of the spanish presidency ( continuation of debate )
the men with clipboards and the statistical spies from eurostat want more data and - let us be honest - you want this data to tax and control , which explains your thirst for ever more statistics .
in 2011 - this much is already clear - the areas where we will have the largest expenditure - including for this service - particularly in the administration lines , are the areas where we have the least amount of leeway .
we also urgently need to consider innovative financing mechanisms , such as a tax on financial transactions , which would make a significant contribution to financing the eu budget .
however , in order for this economy to be strong , the common agricultural policy needs to be supported and strengthened , while at the same time , of course , it has to be taken into account that the technical and social situation needs to change , and soon .
we need limits for food from japan .
it is therefore highly unfortunate that peter mandelson , our most competent commission member , is leaving his post as commissioner responsible for the eu 's trade policy .
the amendments made will help create a hostile environment for traffickers , protect victims and prevent this activity more effectively because fundamental rights must be respected .
nevertheless , day after day we members of parliament discuss this culture shift , this climate change that affects our economies , that forces us to give up our economic dependence on fossil fuels and switch to other energy sources .
it would be a backward step to put this situation in jeopardy ; instead , we should concentrate on improving the transposition of the framework decision , especially in terms of protecting fundamental rights .
at the same time , however , as an mep , i cannot but agree with mrs pack and mrs bildt that true european solidarity involves the european union providing logistical help in meeting criteria rather than deviating from them , as this has a demoralising effect on societies and absolves governments of responsibility .
he allowed five extremely crucial years to pass by .
i had the honour of meeting him on a visit to venezuela .
it is indeed essential that we see that these two problems have to be resolved in parallel ; financial repair must be accelerated , banks restructured and , if need be , recapitalised as soon as possible .
the prime minister of kosovo has recently stated that the declaration of independence is a matter of days away .
in particular , the directive proposes to withdraw bank secrecy in the relations between member states for administrative cooperation purposes .
we must reinforce solidarity among the member states and equip ourselves with the appropriate resources to effectively control the external borders .
one of the aims in revising this directive is to organise , in these conditions , an internal market in ucits which really works .
mr president , mr barroso , you have answered my questions with your inimitable diplomacy , but i do not want to let you get away with this .
a long - term framework is important , but a seven - year freeze with rigid budget ceilings both overall and by sector is an unreasonable model in today 's rapidly changing world .
through cooperation between the various eu educational establishments , erasmus mundus ii will improve the response to the growing demand for student mobility and will promote the quality of higher education in the eu and dialogue between different cultures .
for this reason the vote secured in the committee on constitutional affairs is already a remarkable political result .
i think that , in terms of energy policy , we need , to a certain extent , to move away from the debate of the past , which sought to achieve something with simple figures , binding targets and miracle solutions , because we have clearly not achieved enough .
they therefore need to be protected from unfair competition from third countries .
it is a primary obligation to investigate and prosecute those who commit war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
the dublin regulation shall be amended in such a way as to allow the suspension of transfers to those member states that are undergoing particular pressure .
the large proportion of residents having dual citizenship creates additional differences in respect of rights as well , and so we have to make every effort to abolish these differences and to provide a visa - free regime for all moldovans .
consequently , i wonder why alignment with the most protective rules is being rejected for these people in difficulty .
i voted for this report because i believe that it is vitally important for us to establish trade links which comply with competition principles not only with korea , but also with the other countries outside the eu .
( cs ) madam president , in my opinion , there is no dispute over the fact that subsidies to particular segments of the economy distort and destroy economic competition , and that state aid is therefore damaging to the healthy functioning of the market , not only in the short term but also in the long term .
this is completely unacceptable , and i therefore welcome this report , aimed at giving the spouses significant responsibilities , above all in terms of enlightened choice , choice of jurisdiction and finally choice of applicable law .
we also ought to urge russia to take a more active part in international negotiations , as it is the eve of the copenhagen conference .
this is necessary to be able to pursue the policy effectively .
the final commission position will take account of the latest scientific information on the stock and of the outcome of the meeting of the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tuna which took place in november last year .
this report is merely a long list of proposals and recommendations aimed at the member states so that they grant to the hundreds of thousands of people who each year enter their territory legally or illegally rights that are not only equal to those of their nationals , but also more numerous and effective .
i must also mention our concern over the clamp - down on representatives of the political opposition in that country , journalists and human rights defenders , which the humanitarian organisations operating in yemen have been speaking about for a long time .

on behalf of the gue / ngl group . - ( de ) mr president , commissioner , with the eu - korea free trade agreement signed in october 2010 , which has been assigned the attribute by the commission and the council of being the most ambitious agreement of its kind ever to be negotiated between the eu and a highly industrialised state , the bilateral protection duties are to fall by around 98 % in the next five years .

rapporteur . - ( es ) madam president , i would like to thank all members of the committee on petitions , especially all the shadow rapporteurs and our chairman , marcin libicki , for their cooperation and daily work on petitions .

romania and bulgaria have proven their ability to adopt the necessary domestic legislation and make their borders secure .
the purpose of the directive is to lay down minimum rules to ensure workers ' health and safety by means of two instruments : rest periods and a limit on the working week .
however , in many cases , it is not possible for developing countries to do this because of their poor financial situation .
consequently , it is important that regional strategies form part of a wider european policy .
our group fully supports this compromise , because it is very important and obvious that the economic and social development of the eu 's outermost regions is greatly determined by their periphery , difficult climate and geography and economic dependence on a short range of goods and services .
i am thus asking you , commissioner , to ensure that all of the elements that contribute to the quality of wine and can improve that quality - reducing yields , marketing support , careful protection of geographical indications and designations of origin - are preserved , not only within the eu , but also outside it , when it comes to major multilateral negotiations .
secondly , the report highlights the fundamental elements of the directive 's transposition .
the european ombudsman 's primary concern is to ensure the correct operation of the institutional bodies and organisation of the eu , boosting the confidence that citizens need to have in it .
this question should equally have been asked of the commission in terms of initiating a new legislative proposal to tighten up the relevant legislation so that we can deal with them , but pending that my advice to any small business faced with demands from european city guide and similar guides is simple : do not pay ; ignore them ; ignore the pressure .
the possible entry into force of the treaty of lisbon by the end of 2009 calls for a political agreement between the council and the european parliament in order to ensure that the procedure for the choice of the next president of the commission and for the nomination of the future commission will , in any case , respect the substance of the new powers that the treaty of lisbon assigns to the european parliament on this issue .

he referred to a remark by louis michel .
by raising public awareness about the importance of prevention and a healthy lifestyle we can eventually lower healthcare costs since it is cheaper to prevent diseases than subsequently treat them .
therefore , the internalisation of external costs for air and noise pollution can count on our approval , provided the revenues are invested in making road transport cleaner - something that enjoys broad support .
however , the honourable members will surely agree with me in saying that this agreement is a lot better than the protocol over data exchange that the united states and the eu have had to comply with for years .
in strasbourg they shrug : ' what can we do ? ' - and remain silent .
what is important for the postal sector , its customers , its operators and its employees is that there is a final and unconditional date for full market opening .

then came 23 april , when an action mechanism was adopted regarding greece .

this was the debate about the increase for the rescue package , where you gave the green light but chancellor merkel gave the red one .
these goals can be achieved by supporting development at local and regional levels and , of course , by ensuring common living standards for all eu citizens .
( pl ) madam president , president - in - office , there is only one yardstick against which to measure the czech presidency appointed by your government , and the dramatic events of recent weeks , and that is the energy policy of the european union .
and that puts the ball back in the united states ' court .
yet that is what the multilateral agreement on investments , which was fortunately never adopted in the world trade organisation ( wto ) , was proposing .
i would therefore like to ask the president of the ecb the following three questions .
lastly , we still know far too little about the seas .
european migration policy is necessary , to my mind , not least because , by 2050 , the european working population will have dwindled by 20 million people .
during the process of strengthening the regions , we must pay particular attention to sensitive areas , as has been mentioned in the current cohesion debate .
a report ensuring the transition between the two procedures , one currently in use and the other envisaged in the new treaty , is of significant benefit .

we propose to delete the last sentence of paragraph 9 , which reads : ' calls on the belarusian authorities to end their practice of issuing exit visas to their citizens , in particular , children and students ' .
those would be the only situations in which we should sit up all night drafting resolutions , sitting down at the negotiating table the next day .
commissioner , our approaches may sometimes have been different , but i believe that we have the same objective , which is to develop a beneficial modus vivendi , a way to coexist with this important eastern neighbour .
let me remind you that after the illegal annexation of the republic of estonia by the soviet union in 1940 numerous artefacts were moved from estonia to different destinations in the soviet union that have not been returned , among those objects the presidential collar .
perhaps we will come to understand that it is not right to build on the sand of delusion , on the basis of false premises , and that a firm basis of reliability and solidarity is needed .

in writing . - the urban dimension of cohesion policy needs to be given a greater priority .
in view of the fact that 52.4 % of those laid off are women , and more than 13 % of the workers laid off are over 54 years old , i consider the release of resources for the czech republic to be very proper , and i therefore voted in favour of the report .
internal bureaucracy and the creation of ever more rules and administrative procedures reduce public confidence in the process .
request for consultation of the european economic and social committee - citizens initiative ( vote )

this will need to balance short - term and long - term perspectives on this issue .
it is necessary to renumber some budget lines in order to avoid contradictory numbering of some lines created and to follow nomenclature rules .
at least 70 crops that contribute significantly to the overall economy depend directly on pollination by the bees .
my second point is that i believe that there should be more real - life learning of the languages of the neighbouring countries in border regions , such as czech in eastern bavaria , but that this should not be restricted to schools .
while it is vital to give due attention to the link between ecec services and equality of opportunities for women , these targets are clearly problematic , and outmoded , since they fail to take into account many of the crucial qualitative aspects of a strong early education policy .
the eyes of europeans are turning to the european union for the answers to so many questions .
i think that , at the end of the day , we all would like to make sure our condolences are sent and i hope the president of parliament will send a personal letter to shahbaz bhatti 's mother .
i believe that , given the situation in haiti , this is quite a good result .
the long - standing insurgency is a factor in this sorry state of affairs , but so is the not - so - democratic status of successive filipino governments with the latter being widely held responsible by international agencies , such as the un human rights council , for showing remarkable impunity from extrajudicial killings and the forced disappearances of hundreds of filipino citizens whose activities were thought to have been in disagreement with official government policy .
it is clear from these workshops that the present crisis is not just cyclical , but structural .
finally , mr president , faced with a global crisis that spares no one , including russia , i would like unexpected solutions to emerge and to predispose russia to accept a constructive partnership , and the eu to carry more weight as a united partner .
europeans cannot demand more security without paying for it .
this programme is being put in place and i hope that the first results will materialise .
to give a blank cheque to the other institutions while excluding parliament is to withdraw this institution 's supervision of the allocation of resources and sectoral priorities in connection with development cooperation .
( de ) madam president , mrs győri , mrs reding , i fail to see the point of this debate .
i believe that it is important for us now to be able to learn the lesson from the lisbon strategy 's failure and also to have the ability to take action to mitigate the impact of this in future .
i voted against this paragraph because 60 t goods vehicles , to which this paragraph has just opened the door , are dangerous for the environment and for the users of our roads , which were not designed to carry these loads .
leicester is one of the most diverse cities in the united kingdom for all sorts of different reasons - it has both rich and poor , of many different nationalities - and yet , because of individual and local action , leicester has one of the most coherent strategies for the cohesion and integration , as we say here , of vulnerable communities and groups .
i also heard that the socialists are against voting on historical truth .

i think that this is an important step forward , but we have to be realistic , because , as we saw yesterday , for example , in the referendum , it is sometimes not easy to be european .
- ( fr ) madam president , i should like to say that , in view of the growing threat of sea piracy off the horn of africa , the draft motion for a resolution on piracy supports the will of the member states to undertake a coordinated naval campaign .
that , in truth , is the only possible argument for it .
i assure you that in the run - up to the european elections i will strongly argue for the kind of europe my party wishes to see , as well as being very critical indeed of the socialist europe which mr rasmussen - who has just left us - and his colleagues wish to see in their election manifesto published this week .

the vote will take place on thursday , 26 march 2009 .

i am confident that in the few months that lie ahead , the commissioner will make every effort or leave it to the next commissioner to ensure the project 's success .
20 .
the reduction of their military budget will be a dividend to invest in a fund for democratic transition .
the directive also states that the commission should report to parliament every three years and that the commission may propose amendments .
finally , i would like to say that i will certainly report your comments to my colleague , mr mandelson , to be taken fully into consideration in the discussions with other wto members .
furthermore , it is very important to ensure appropriate and sufficient funding for these projects , according to criteria of transparency and proportionality , with particular attention being paid to smes .
one of the things that i think will be very interesting as the commission begins to look at the future of the gsp regulation is to see whether aspects of that regulation that concern the ratification and implementation of human rights and conventions could be improved .
in brussels central station , there are six information points ; four of them are closed .
now is the time to take responsibility , and responsibility also involves europe and the member states .
as far as the architecture of the agreement is concerned , it will need to cover all elements relating to adaptations , reductions in emissions and fast - start funding .
despite the positive resolutions recently adopted by parliament , the tarabella report and the resolution on beijing + 15 , unfortunately , the un meeting has not yet produced any results .

we are calling on the authorities to allow an unimpeded and open debate about the constitution before the referendum , to stop persecuting political activists and to repeal laws that limit the freedom of expression .
i sincerely hope that our proposals and recommendations will be reflected in concrete actions taken by the european commission and mainly by member states because we have no time to lose .
i believe that the proposed amendments , tabled by the group of the progressive alliance of socialists and democrats in the european parliament , and adopted in committee , contribute to a more inclusive definition , encompassing freedom of religion and an extension of the list of minorities in need of international protection .
i therefore urge the commission to take steps to guarantee compliance with the kyoto commitments and their repercussions .
since the start of the negotiations , 22 chapters - out of 35 - have been opened , of which seven have been provisionally closed .
( fr ) madam speaker , i should like to commend mrs trautmann , mrs del castillo , mrs toia and mr harbour for a job well done .
this means that there is no guarantee in terms of age limits , pension amounts and benefits in general .
it refers more specifically to china and india on the issue of promoting cooperation on energy policy to limit pollutants .
that is why we believe that the crisis is currently a key factor in motivating member states to adopt quickly a new european strategy for jobs and smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
it will be one of the focal points , one of the priorities of our presidency .
in addition , the commission is aware of the matter to which the honourable member of the european parliament refers in connection with the different policies followed by the different member states in terms of the facility to replace one drug perhaps marketed as a patent medicine by a generic medicine , but this issue is one which is addressed by the member states themselves .
i favour this .
in writing . - ( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i wish to express my full support for this report , the fruit of a lengthy and excellent job by our colleague michael cashman .
without them we would not have achieved today 's result .
mr corbett could be in charge , for example , of unseating anyone who did not share his views .
in addition , more than ever , europe needs to continuously maintain the confidence of its citizens , all its citizens , in its institutions .
the arguments used concern the fear of uncontrollable floods of refugees and how corruption must be countered .
in future discussions on the impending cohesion policy , it would be useful , at the same time , to clarify how the various macro - regional strategies and mainstream eu regional policies will co - exist alongside one another .
of course not !
however , no proposals have yet come through for a social chapter for the protection of trade union rights and collective agreements .
free trade is good !
that is what mrs jaakonsaari and mrs gebhardt have recommended .
while we protest vigorously against inhuman behaviour and discrimination in burma or other remote places , yesterday the number of meps who thought that the events in italy require more than a complaisant one - minute speech exceeded only by six the number of those who believe that this is not business as usual .
it is true that different international regulations govern the procurement practices in the space industry .
the refusal to discuss with parliament new financial resources for the eu budget in accordance with the treaty of lisbon , and the refusal to enter into dialogue over the multiannual financial framework , constitute sad caricatures of the once - lauded british sense of humour .
he has done an amazing job in bringing this dossier to such a successful conclusion today and , indeed , in laying the foundations for this success in his original report on patient mobility way back in june 2005 .
i also regret the rejection of proposals such as those which regarded the amount of the recovery plan ( 1.5 % of eu gdp ) to be insufficient to successfully tackle the current crisis , noting that the eu will lag far behind countries such as the united states and china .
there is one requirement : for these sovereignties to complement each other and , if possible , not to contradict each other .
there is a need , not just for simplification , but also for an improved system for companies to access this financing .
the process is inevitable if the international community , including arab countries , does not promote the viability of one side and the security of the other as the objective of the peace process in the middle east .
it is particularly appropriate that the hungarian presidency has chosen as its motto ' strong europe ' .
the joint debate is closed .
have no doubt about it : this is our sole objective and our task here today .
we believe that this can be better achieved if parliament closely monitors the application of the new instrument from the outset , which is why we called for this own - initiative report .
until october , the coordination cell will continue to play its supporting role towards the member states to try to improve the security conditions in the area .
rapex is more than just five letters : it is a european rapid alert system which provides warnings for consumers about hazardous consumer products .
it is a right for fathers and children .
accordingly , if we want to create a so - called union of results or union of action , we must strengthen cohesion policy .
the role of the aforementioned institutions has developed further in the era of globalisation , especially in areas where national leaders are unable to establish a central authority around governments based on the rule of law and ensure the fundamental security of the inhabitants concerned .
on afghanistan and pakistan : the new administration agrees on the importance of a more comprehensive policy - to add a civilian surge in parallel to a military surge .
this must be clear , mr president ; as rapporteur i must say this because it is essential in order to interpret the vote .
( nl ) mr president , sustainability is a key concept in the green paper , and rightly so : sustainable in the sense of being both future - proof for fisheries and good for the environment .
of course , organised crime will be included in this .
the question is : is it really the most sensible thing to drive an energy pipeline along the bottom of this particular part of the european union ?
the new approach proposed in the strategy will make it possible to minimise the risk of infectious diseases breaking out in animals .
i am confident this framework will evolve with time , but i very much welcome mr hökmark 's report because it strengthens the proposal while keeping the balance we need .
the exceptional arrangement applies every time now .
in fact , i was speaking about what europe should be like in five or ten years , and what direction we should be taking .
statements by the president
manufacturers need clear regulations and certainty .
even the erstwhile employment guarantor , a good education , is rarely any help nowadays .
this particular priority creates scope to continue with the innovation and new green technology that will help give us the edge at a global level .
the first thing to consider , mr turk and mr almunia - and maybe you can pass this message on to mr verheugen - is what will be in the text of the resolution on climate change at the spring summit .
who closed down rural train stations , railways and maternity homes ?
a glaring example is italy where , by the end of 2009 , the public authorities were in debt to companies to the tune of approximately eur 60 billion , and the payment delay averaged 186 days , with extremes of 800 days .
the international community must assist the east timorese people in these steps .
secondly , i hope that a number of member states will now really get on with making use of the new opportunities and will also be able to tempt other member states to join in on the strength of their good results .
the economic dimension of the problem is obvious .
while i support the report 's objective of inviting the commission to simplify public procurement procedures in order to save local government and enterprises from having to devote substantial amounts of time and money to strictly bureaucratic issues , i regret the wording of the second part of paragraph 9 .
it was parliament 's intention initially to grant the committee of european securities regulators ( cesr ) the power to take care of registration , but , sadly , it did not work because of the tug - of - war that will inevitably ensue between the big countries and large financial centres to attract those head offices and be able to play first fiddle there , in an attempt to get the large rating offices under their wings .
the european commission has made clear that it will be prepared to support an interest rate reduction , and i would expect that the 27 member states will reach a consensus regarding the reconsideration of this question .
on behalf of the alde group . - ( de ) mr president , mrs geoghegan - quinn , the arrival of a container full of trainers on an island somewhere , which was received enthusiastically by the residents , has in the past made headline news .
( fr ) madam president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to begin by pointing out that i did not believe it right to give our opinion so early on with a vote on the events that took place in laâyoune on 8 november , when we do not have all the facts at our disposal to give us the necessary hindsight and objectivity .
regardless of these two reservations , i appeal to the member states , the council and the commission , including the czech presidency , to urgently update the relevant european and national legislation and to ratify international agreements for effectively combating paedophilia .
i would like to acknowledge the contribution of ireland , especially through the irish marine institute , in helping to form this policy .
as stated in the communication from the commission , this relationship can and must be a driving force for developing dialogue with mercosur .
i am therefore against the tabled report .
it could be a lobbyist for nature , a lobbyist for business , the local authorities or the national government .
i hope that just as in the case of the long - awaited revision of the constitution , which was at last carried out , it will soon also be possible to amend other legislation which clearly discriminates against pakistan 's minorities .
meps need to have comprehensive information about the resources and materials available to them in order to perform their work responsibly and efficiently .
the referee makes a decision here .
it is anything but workable , mr simpson .
not so long ago , the european union witnessed cyber attacks against public and private organisations in estonia and in lithuania , in 2007 and 2008 respectively .
open the debate .
the answer can always be found by asking : who benefits from intransparency ?
i want to see the people of gaza with a future , but i also want to see gilad shalit , captive for years in gaza , given the chance to go home to his mother and father whom i have already met .
there are many of us , therefore , who will not vote for this commission , and that does not make us anti - europeans . we are simply doing what our voters - many million european citizens - expect of us .
the eur 549 946 will offer some assistance to them in being reintegrated into the labour market .
the employment offers no security .
at the same time , i would like to point out that the political dialogue between the eu and belarus must be conditional on , and directly connected to , the lifting of restrictions on freedoms and cessation of the repression of participants in peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists .
on behalf of the ecr group . - i agree entirely with that .
i consider this to be a clear rejection of the attempts by provocateurs and conspirators at speculating about the status quo .
the new directive should be a stimulus to the development of new ways of creating jobs .
i am very concerned about this , mr president , and for this reason i am raising it in parliament right now , hoping that athens will both send me a proper reply and deliver a full and fair review of the case of mr zafiropoulos .
the next item is the report by mr berlato , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ( ec ) no 1782/2003 as regards the transfer of tobacco aid to the community tobacco fund for the years 2008 and 2009 and regulation ( ec ) no 1234/2007 with regard to financing of the community tobacco fund - c 6-0062/2008 - .
to this end , i think it desirable that the proposal should apply not only to third - country fishing vessels but also to those flying the community flag , in order to adopt non - discriminatory measures and introduce a common policy within the european union .
it is clear , but it must be stated , that the proposal in relation to the present eurovignette directive constitutes an amendment that will allow external costs to be internalised within the scope of the current directive .
by the way , i am also convinced that big companies do not need the internal market as much as smaller companies do .
without going into all the details once more , i am convinced that the initial 1996 ban on the inhaler was not legitimately imposed .
rapporteur . - mr president , i wish to begin by thanking all those who have contributed to my report - i am very grateful for their help .
let me conclude by confirming that the commission recognises that europe 's landscape is the result of a long process of human intervention .
aung san suu kyi , the emblematic leader of the opposition , is still under house arrest , entire populations have been displaced , children are press - ganged into being child soldiers and people who opposed the regime in place are arrested .
the coming year will be especially important for the presence of the eu on the global stage .
it has allowed the individuals involved to seek solutions to their own problems .
he told me : ' you are from vorarlberg , go across the border , to liechtenstein or switzerland ! '
much work still lies ahead , but eu legislation is the right way forward and gives us hope that the future will be free of hazards from everyday items and that neither we nor our children will be threatened by them .
if we look around and summarise what the member states have done , there is only one member state that has achieved 1.5 % , and that is germany , which was not initially the country on the front line when it came to taking action .
values such as the environment , social guarantees and , at the end of the day , democratic institutions .
we share this vision and we are glad that your report refers to a number of significant initiatives taken at european union level , such as the european year of creativity and innovation .
i believe we must therefore also call for protection of the specific interests of local communities .
( pl ) mr president , at the last eu - russia summit , the parties signed a memorandum on the principles of an early warning mechanism on energy matters .
( sk ) mr president , i would like to thank mrs rivasi for an exhaustive report .
the international monetary fund , the world bank and the governments of many countries know that food shortages threaten the biological security of peoples .
for this reason , we are voting against the draft amendments , which open the way for insecurity by advocating savings in parliament .
i decided to speak because some new issues have come up in the last few years .
apart from the threat of accident or terrorist attack , there is also considerable evidence of adverse health effects along ireland 's eastern seaboard attributed to sellafield discharges .
ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your attention .
it makes the capacity of the leaders of the member states to act in this matter merely optional , even though they are the ones elected by the people .
i fully agree that the ilo is the cornerstone in producing ilo standards and making reference to them in the international discussion is of key importance .
mr president , i would like to ask my colleague if he does not accept that transferring from the national to the european budget some key items of expenditure is going to produce cost efficiencies and economies of scale and save national treasuries money .
equality between women and men - 2008 (
corrections to votes and voting intentions : see minutes
as the president of the commission mentioned , during your presidency the ' energy package ' is to be presented : this is the result of the work done by all last year and we know that there is a widespread commotion about it and manoeuvring and pressures are already in progress to diminish its value and impact .
you say this because compared with the situation of the american economy , yes , our economy is fundamentally much sounder .
( pl ) today 's debate on economic governance in the european union is a fundamental discussion , because it concerns the matter of continuing to strengthen european integration .
i wish you a very warm welcome !
in view of the frequency of earthquakes in europe , the number of victims and the material damage involved , it is highly unlikely that resources from a solidarity fund to assist the victims of earthquakes would be used only once .
people want a european bill of rights just like in the federal united states .
for this reason , we have to support a un - led solution that is as prompt and peaceful as possible .
the hypocrisy of this approach is clear , particularly when the ' european family ' of so - called ' democratic nations ' does not have a single word of condemnation for the genuine massacre perpetrated by the israeli army against the palestinian people in the gaza strip or for the cia 's criminal flights , in which it was , for that matter , complicit .
the subject areas touched on in it are extremely important in terms of ensuring that the cotonou agreement remains the basis for a solid partnership with the acp countries , as well as a relevant instrument against the backdrop of the new challenges which these countries are facing .
you should decide what you want to do .
there is still much to be done to achieve this principle and i hope that we will make this a political priority in all areas of our work in the european parliament .
( de ) madam president , i have a lot of sympathy with the position of the group of the european people 's party ( christian democrats ) in other areas .
in this case , europe 's role should be that of a moderator , not a regulator .
i thank the european parliament for appointing the rapporteurs within the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs and for setting an indicative timetable scheduling the submission of the report for the end of september , and the votes within the committee on civil liberties , justice and home affairs and then in plenary , for october and november .
in the light of the forthcoming elections to the russian parliament , it is equally important that the elections be held in accordance with the principles established by the council of europe and the osce .
the next item is the one - minute speeches on matters of political importance .
it is not a particularly important discussion , as the employment guidelines contain every opportunity for action .
my colleague péter olajos has mentioned that ground level has shrunk back by four metres in homokhátság , between the danube and the tisza , in the last four decades . desertification has now reached hungary and central europe .
in that respect i would have perhaps expected to see more of a theme emerging with regard to the need for what i would call financial security for our citizens in a world where we know there is financial turbulence at the moment and where people feel uncertain about the future - perhaps more of a theme in that respect .
it may be that the commission and the council will decide to freeze derivatives , at least to propose it at world level , and to suspend trading in these commodities .
we have had experiences in the past of commodity boards .
the eu member states have not adopted any such charter .
( nl ) mr füle , welcome to the house !
one of the presidency 's objectives is actually to reach an agreement on eu aid for trade strategy at october 's general affairs and external relations council , including an outline of the specific steps envisaged for attaining the eur 2 billion agreed for trade - related assistance by 2010 , notably the eur 1 billion from the member states to meet the needs identified by the developing countries .
this also applies to current threats such as organised crime , terrorism , cyber threats , human and drug trafficking , energy security , as well as activities relating to early warning mechanisms and conflict prevention and resolution .
that has not been the same sort of success story on account of the sheer size of the euro zone and the difference in its economies .
in writing . - ( pt ) one of the eu 's basic obligations and responsibilities is to create safe living conditions for european citizens .
with regard to road transport , there are two important points i should like to make .
in this regard , we need greater cooperation between the customs authorities and consumer protection authorities in the member states in order to protect consumers from unsafe imports .
the first two reactors are already operating safely and efficiently .
i am pleased that the czech republic , finland , france and others are taking a realistic approach to the issue . this is in contrast to countries where nuclear energy has become a pawn in pre - election battles to an extent that is almost unethical , bearing in mind the situation in japan .
as a brand name is associated with perceived quality , this practice could result in misleading the public .
last , but by no means least , we have a capacity to determine the number of hives that are out there .
however , it was envisaged , under this amendment 86 , that this provision would be changed in order to let you decide which of the representatives of the non - attached members should sit in the conference of presidents .
i strongly oppose the extension of the mandatory levy of a minimum standard vat rate of 15 % for a further five years .
however , we do have problems with technical matters , the solution of which is growing into a political problem , as my colleague mrs roure said .
i have nevertheless seen fit to back some amendments modifying the initial draft , particularly those relating to 2011 as the date for the scheme 's entry into force .
we must ensure that the organised people traffickers do not have the opportunity to make billions of euro in profit out of people 's fates as a result of our right of asylum .
subject : european funding for the turkish army in cyprus
there is no doubt that this fact is of fundamental importance for security in europe , as russia possesses the greatest conventional armed forces potential on our continent .
in my view , that target is still valid , and we should strive to reach it - particularly in those countries and regions where progress towards its achievement has been very limited , for example , in africa .
as you know , the human rights issue was raised and discussed at the very recent summit meeting in beijing and the joint statement also explicitly refers to it .
i support the proposal that bulgaria and romania should inform the european parliament and the council , in writing in the course of a six - month period , of further action that they intend to take as regards recommendations , submitted in assessment reports and mentioned in subsequent reports , which have yet to be implemented .
political parties should put an end to the boycott of the national parliament , and enter a dialogue with the institutions .
for several years i have been saying here in the european parliament that the situation in the indian ocean , the situation off the coast of somalia for european fishermen and for vessels that operate and work there is unsustainable , and there has not been a great deal of response .
i believe that the defence of human rights is one of the crucial objectives that any democratic state and any democratic organisation such as the european union must pursue .
' two sides ' also means that enhancing transparency will only be effective if it is accompanied by due diligence , and not undone again by excessive disclaimers .
in writing . - i fully support the resolution dealing with the tragic situation in burma .
we support the commission approach , and that of commissioner füle in particular .
the change is necessary , as our role as the un 's biggest provider of finance , one that has largely gone unnoticed , has shown .
it is important to say that the various horror scenarios which were spread at the time regarding the consequences of increased mobility have proved to be false .
polluters must pay .
the situation of human rights within the european union is by no means satisfactory , and the annual report by amnesty international says as much .
there must be a deadline for negotiations to be successfully completed and someone meanwhile should offer mugabe a retirement home .
they include the emphasis placed on the environmental debt of the countries of the north in relation to those of the south and the request for additional aid in this area .
while welcoming the sentiments on dealing with poverty expressed in the commission 's package , what we are really looking for is concrete action .
at the very beginning we , as representatives of lithuania and representatives of other countries , suggested that these issues be dealt with on behalf and at the level of parliament and the council .
this issue does not just concern progress made in equal opportunities and non - discrimination in terms of employment and working conditions ; the central issue is the need for a horizontal directive on equal treatment which covers all grounds for discrimination .
i bid you all a warm welcome .
this sets a new record for absurdly detailed regulation .
although we have a single set of provisions , their practical implementation varies widely from one airport to another , and this creates problems and annoyance .
it is clear , therefore , that we in europe are not ready for this and that therefore our trains will be unable , or insufficiently able , to communicate with these new signalling installations .
we began talking about tunisia on 10 january and i put out statements on egypt last week .
if that proposal is not lawful , the committee on legal affairs will tell us .
it is easy for us to talk , but very hard to take effective action .
rapporteur . - ( de ) mr president , after yesterday 's debate in the house , it has become apparent that a large majority would actually be in favour of our replacing the word ' could ' with the phrase ' should in any case ' .
our respective services have also had a lot of contact and cooperation .
i consider that allowing duty free shops to continue to trade on land borders would be a solution which is also in keeping with the commission 's own proposals , while controlling their modus operandi and stamping out cases of tax evasion would , as with all other shops , be the responsibility of the ports and airports .
perhaps it was to benefit some states more than others ?
it also did not do so in order to gain political return from this condemnation .
the relevant tftp agreement was approved by parliament in july 2010 .
use of specially trained units , like the polish search and rescue group of the national fire service , which holds un certification , should be taken into account .
mr president , in view of what we have just been speaking about , i would like to say that security in this building has been stepped up and i wish to extend our thanks to the men and women who protect us .
( lt ) i will take this opportunity to speak about the eu diplomatic mission in belarus .
the union is india 's main economic partner , but there is still scope for our companies to improve their position in those sectors of the indian economy that are undergoing dynamic development .
of course , member states have a fundamental responsibility here to restructure budgets , giving priority to social security and investments in growth at the same time as deficits are reduced .
today millions of people are working illegally .
( pl ) mr president , we are debating an important report concerning the financing of the common agricultural policy .
i voted in favour of this document , because it is crucial for more effective provision of humanitarian aid .
these policies must be supported by an appropriate budget , but also by reliable checks on the programmes implemented , with suitable follow - ups and the identification of good practices .
so far in the eu there are no national definitions and there is no data collection , so we have no idea of the scale of this problem .
if we agree to this kind of law in europe , how are we going to have discussions with mr lukashenko ?
i expect the member states to respect that .
at a time when reunified europe is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , eu - russia relations take on particular importance and deserve careful consideration .
since their accession to the eu , in 2007 , both bulgaria and romania have had a legitimate expectation that their citizens would become fully fledged eu citizens and that they would be able to enjoy the same rights as other eu citizens , including freedom of movement within the schengen area .
smes are the driving force of our economies - they should not be punished for mismanagement in the financial sector .
indeed , the financial system has generated substantial profits from speculative transactions , and it does not have to pay any tax .
biogas can also be used to help make farms and areas more self - sufficient in energy , and just a small part of this resource has actually been tapped .
secondly , on 31 october , and for the first time in two years , an opposition demonstration was held in triumph square in moscow without the police intervening .
without adequate resources , none of these problems will be properly dealt with , beginning with the introduction of the intermediate category in cohesion policy , which only makes sense if it does not harm the other categories already in place .
the funds are distributed for eu projects and policies in all member states , admittedly , in varying proportions .
in connection with the military conflict which took place in georgia a year ago , we are monitoring with great unease the situation in south ossetia in particular .
i believe that it is extremely important to use appropriate political wisdom , courage and mutual good will to solve these issues , not only on the part of these candidate countries , but also on the part of the member states of the european union .
5 .
i also hope that support will be provided to tackle the housing crisis faced by our fellow citizens , which often reaches alarming levels , particularly in the great conurbations .
i would like to build on that beautiful thought by saying that until recently we could only listen to what the candidates and thereafter new members of the european union expected from it .
that is why i thank you most sincerely , and that is also why i , in turn , will listen to you very carefully .
i wish to express my personal sympathy to all those that are suffering as a consequence of the disaster .
we are very much relying on parliament 's contribution to this effort in order to strengthen and enhance the solidarity of the people of the european union and of the other union players in this area , notably the ngos .
voluntary activity cannot be separated from european working life and is seen as a basic tenet of democracy at both local and public level .
if we take a clear look at community policy in recent years we see that , beyond political actions , we are militarily lightweight .
this should make for a more efficient procedure and bring clear benefits for both employers and third - country nationals who want to immigrate to the territory of the member states .
we all want to preserve our identities and how we feel about ourselves , and we need to do that .
for example , the criteria for selecting best - practice projects could be the quality and sustainability of the projects , the driving force for the regions and for the european union , the effective use of resources and , of course , transferability to other regions .
communication of council common positions : see minutes
certain dishonest civil servants are enriching themselves from funds earmarked for training and reskilling .
i am therefore certain that this report represents parliament 's opinion as to how we can help forests , how we can help our communities to adapt to climate change .
however , there could still be certain preventive instruments .
for this reason , i am sympathetic to the european commission 's proposal .
again , it is the member states that are on the front line , to the detriment of the european unity that we require in this area .
there is another important sentence which is also to be found towards the end of the document .
this new framework agreement on relations may potentially consolidate the achievements of the treaty of lisbon and this could represent a significant breakthrough .
single application procedure for residence and work (
the truth is important , but it will not deliver gas .
the language law creates an imbalance .
it also enjoys broad support from all the political groups .
importers , holidaymakers and consumers must all be aware of their responsibility in this respect .
in october 2008 , the government of the former yugoslavian republic of macedonia filed an application for community financing for corridor 10 , which crosses its territory .
firstly , as part of our policy on the integrated management of the external borders , there is a reinforcement of frontex in the budget , as already decided , in 2008 , by the budget authority .
an initiative will only be successful if it is easily implemented and accessible to all .
what we are asking you to do for the first time , in your proposals , is to use clusters when dividing up the responsibilities .
( pt ) regional differences remain a challenge in the context of an enlarged european union .
the federation of european securities exchanges keeps statistics on foreign equity trading , as well as on the percentage of shares owned by investors .
vice - president of the commission . - mr president , there is no doubt that there is a strong feeling of solidarity in all member states , and in the commission as well , concerning this terrible earthquake .
her mother and the african charitable organisation heal africa have been her only support .
the first is the promotion and development of fibre - optic networks , known as next - generation networks .
during the last 50 years or so , tens of millions of inhabitants of europe have not been born because pregnancies ended in artificial abortions .
in the fight against terrorism , it is important to respect human rights not only as a matter of principle , but also to counter radicalisation around the world .
as i stressed everywhere , progress on the path to the eu depends on the commitment to reform at home .
in the near future , this means jointly ensuring the conduct of free , fair and transparent local elections .
( fr ) mr president , as spokesperson for the majority french party , the ump , i congratulate the portuguese presidency and i am delighted with this agreement on the text of the treaty .
this is a very big problem - not only for third world countries , but also within the european union , as there is a very serious brain drain from the east to the west .
we must endeavour to provide common rules , to set limits beyond which information is no longer considered to be independent .
we would also like to highlight the commission 's proposal to evaluate the small business act by the end of 2010 , so as to make life easier for these companies , especially by simplifying bureaucratic and tax matters , and placing greater emphasis on social responsibility .
european broadband - investing in digitally driven growth (
in fact , it could be said that something did change : president berlusconi signed an agreement with colonel gaddafi in spite of the fact that colonel gaddafi was not complying with international law and expelled the united nations high commissioner for refugees knowing that he had 9 000 refugees in libya ; the same libya that is currently being bombed after a humanitarian appeal .
the statutory radio of the slovak republic is bound by law to broadcast in national minority languages .
however , doing more and doing better is not just a case of increasing resources .
the contracting parties adopted amendments to it at nafo annual meetings in 2007 and 2008 .
26 .
there is no doubt that eur 90 million is too little to ensure proper functioning of the scheme .
we have a long way to go in this regard .
a total of eur 33 million has been approved since 2000 , but to this day , not a single euro has been used .
the detailed modalities have yet to be clarified .
that is doubtless true !
what you said could be an example of good practice , but i cannot state that here as a representative of the council .
they are legitimate concerns of the international community , a fact which is underlined by the existence of instruments of international law for the protection of human rights for over half a century .
the directive will not apply to weapons and ammunition collectors , to public services or to cultural and historical institutions .
increased co - ownership is also essential .
i understand that general motors has yet to discuss this plan with the workers ' representatives , who are expected to make commitments in order to allow significant cost reductions to be made in europe .
there is also plenty of evidence of the need for future restrictions .
underlying discourses on european party regulation is a deeper concern of how to co - constitute a transnational civic space composed of free and equal citizens , and what a collective founding , in the form of a ' civic contract ' among diverse peoples , might entail for the future of integration .
one important element will be flexibility in the programming process , so that funding and priorities can adapt to today 's rapidly changing world .
we also discussed at length the need to deepen internal market reform in the annual growth survey .
there are two prominent representatives of the opposition here - mr kazulin and mr milinkevich .
according to the commission 's official statistics , unemployment reached 4.7 % in 2007 , with long - term unemployment standing at 2.8 % .
as you were once one of us and have fought for this in the committee on foreign affairs , we see you as a fellow combatant in this area .
the financing instrument for development cooperation ( dci ) improves the european union 's previous development cooperation framework by combining the various geographical and thematic instruments into a single instrument .
the g 20 summit in washington in november 2008 was precisely the result of those joint efforts .
abolishing the visa requirement for serbia , montenegro and macedonia is very much to be welcomed , as the commission 's recommendation follows careful evaluation and the meeting of requirements set .
it is good that you have attempted today to present a road map .
i doubt whether a brutal regime which does not hesitate to dispense with the lives of 156 of its citizens and is responsible for so many other atrocities will be moved by such a disproportionately small sanction on that issue .
obviously not !
however , this is just one side of the story .
i believe therefore that the priorities for eu action should be the identification of union - wide legal instruments , the possibility to make use of free support , the creation of refuges capable of providing psychological and moral assistance and the creation of a single emergency number throughout europe .
today 's debate has focused largely on the party closure and rightly so .
the fact is that the national government of each member state also has a role here as regards imposing the requirements and conditions for strengthening the single currency , and moving this project of monetary and economic integration forward .
as we have underlined several times , enlargement reinforces peace , democracy and stability in europe , serves the european union 's strategic interests and helps the eu to better achieve its policy objectives in important areas which are key to economic recovery and sustainable growth .
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see minutes
more so than in previous years , i have therefore done my best to ensure that the tone of the report is very objective and constructive .
faced with the disastrous consequences of this path , instead of retracing its steps , the eu continues to show signs of wanting to rush blindly ahead .
we have therefore all been given the opportunity , under the french presidency , to open this debate and to try to reconcile our positions ; this is what the commission likewise hopes to achieve .
therefore , i would again like to thank mrs lucas , and of course i would like to thank the author of the question , mr markov .
these complaints submitted by eu citizens constitute an important source of information on possible infringements of eu law .
i welcome the reference in the report 's explanatory statement to the fact that the chinese scramble in africa is reaping african national resources for chinese profit and undermining sustainable development .
there is a balance to be had between liberal market conditions and issues of the needs of developing countries and it is absolutely necessary that we continue to debate this issue time and time again .
however , i think that mr gauzès and his friends have done a good job .
we have now managed successfully to injure a serbia trying to forget milošević and build a democratic future .
opening of the sitting
we should reject it on moral grounds in the name of respect for animals , but also in the name of our own humanity .
action aimed at increasing the number of transplants performed is particularly important .
in addition , it is important that the directive is neutral in technological terms , in that it should not specifically encourage the use of any particular fuel or technology .
for that , you have a crucial role to play in ensuring the successful implementation of the europe 2020 strategy .
as far as his approach is concerned , i consider his actions to be the responsible actions of a statesman who , as long as he felt a measure of legal uncertainty , waited for the opinion of the relevant institution , which was the court .
( da ) madam president , i would like to address the danes in particular .
they came from the chemical and steel industries and airports .
as regards the problem of development and humanitarian action , it is true that so much still remains to be done in south sudan and that we must continue to develop the north and , most importantly , not to isolate it .
( the president : ' on coelho ' )
in 2010 , the commission published the action plan on global navigation satellite system ( gnss ) applications .
my last remark concerns the comments made by mr bowis in relation to the toxic effects of the alternatives .
for my constituents , less than a year on , that rings very hollow indeed .
cohesion policy is an expression of solidarity between european regions .
the rapporteur is clear , however .
we maintain that the current definition leads to ambiguity and a risk of unpredictability and bad practice .
our report firmly states that convergence on different levels is a prior condition for long - term competitiveness in the regions , and that in years to come complementarity of the two policies will be necessary to reconcile effectiveness and solidarity .
it is also the region with the highest prevalence of deaths resulting from hiv infection , the prevalence rate in the adult population exceeding 15 % in several countries .
similarly , we cannot allow russia simply to behave as if last summer 's war in georgia did not happen .
our condemnation of the attacks is fair and necessary , but insufficient : the principle of reciprocity does not appear in this resolution .
for this reason the commission should proceed with a territorial impact assessment of sectorial policies to enhance an effective eu urban agenda .
could i say to sinn féin in particular : can they not acknowledge the role of the european union in peace in northern ireland ?
the slovenian presidency is usually very helpful , but unfortunately today 's situation is such that you are right to complain .
( el ) mr president , as a greek , i wish to thank all my fellow members who spoke positively about greece and to stress that i think that the survival of a state transcends party political divisions and positions .
young people who support the opposition are being conscripted into the army .
our group has no problem in supporting the wish for an arctic treaty , but more in the light of a quest for a new mode of governance .
for example , in this case , at our request , an evaluation study was carried out at the end of 2005 by an independent external consultant , whose recommendations in terms of management and conservation of resources have been taken into account , together with the scientific advice provided by guinea - bissau 's research institute following the 2006 trawling campaign .
in order to provide the prospect of a better life and future , a public network of crèches and nursery schools needs to be created , covering a wider geographic area and more open to models of teaching that encourage the development of the child and of society , and that combat social segregation and discrimination .
we also suggest that the cultural and creative sector at large should set up a platform on the cultural and creative industries and one on the access to culture , along the lines of the existing platform on intercultural dialogue .
it is especially difficult when we see no signs , at this moment , of iran signing a contract to build a nuclear power plant apart from what they have done with the russians in bushehr , for which the russians have supplied the fuel .
for its part , the european union granted financial assistance as part of the accession treaty , restricted to the 2007-2009 period only , with the aim of supporting decommissioning and dealing with the consequences of closing the units early .
in fact , the european commission foresaw a continued increase in unemployment and a large deterioration in public finances for spain in the next few years , and this year it is very probable that we will see a reduction in bank credit for families and businesses .
forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see minutes
it worked very well , but it is obvious that it worked well because in those three countries we had the support of their governments , because without such support on this issue it is extremely difficult .
my question is this : does the commission intend to provide individual member states with tools that they can use to prevent such large - scale social security fraud ?
it is therefore important that leaders in the g 20 seoul summit last week very clearly and strongly committed themselves to abstain from competitive devaluations of their currencies .
this has improved our shared knowledge and monitoring of the epidemiological situation .
i wonder why parliament is always ready to take a stand against countries that violate laws but does not acknowledge that there is a country among the 27 member states that is violating laws .
we are working together with the member states in a joint eu programming exercise to maximise the impact on the ground .
the eu should take responsibility when it comes to global warming , which manifests itself very much in the form of temperature increases .
one further point : the european union would like to conclude free trade agreements , which also apply to foreign investments , with countries like china , korea , india and the asean and acp countries .
we need to draw a distinction here in order to be fair and honest .
that which has been achieved must now be defended , and i hope that the comprehensive reform of the european union can now enter into force .
with the instruments of the treaty of lisbon , it will be simpler to create this common policy , but it is also necessary for us , as member states , to have a genuine will to create such a united policy and not to continue prioritising bilateral channels with moscow , which are , at times , openly divergent from each other .
the situation is especially bad close to the border between mexico and the united states of america .
this has been a joint and collaborative exercise and i am extraordinarily grateful to all of you for the work that has gone on .
aside from the other important aspects considered in this respect , including certain technical aspects , the fundamental aim of this directive is to remove all obstacles to the movement of ' community trains ' .
i should like to ask you , mr president , on behalf of my group , what you intend to do over the next few months so that the strengthening of the single european market will help to fight the serious economic crisis with which we are faced today .
unfortunately , feelings of sympathy or solidarity with refugees are even less well developed in south east asia than they are in europe .
in actual fact , it all boils down to the good faith and good will of tour operators and travel agents .
honourable members , i should like to begin by thanking , even if he is not present , the honourable member who tabled this question for his interest in this matter .
they have played their part in making possible the success that we have achieved and for that i ask that we thank them .
it is also pleasing to see the integration of the proposed 65 new posts into the estimates for 2009 with the idea of strengthening parliament 's legislative activity and services to members , while at the same time placing 15 % of those appropriations in reserve .
it is alarming to learn that implementation of the small business act is coming up against many obstacles in the member states , although the examples of several countries show that following these principles yields good results .
but if the latter is true and no action is taken , then citizens will be frustrated and angry .
similarly , you said you would not criminalise individuals for downloading from the internet , but then you talked about the external borders of the community and what might happen with people going away rather than coming into the eu , so again , we do not want anything in acta which criminalises anyone for individual use .
( fr ) mr president , commissioner , i think we are all agreed on the importance of tourism .
thus it is not a question of penalising ; you should not reward products that are not healthy by giving them a lower vat rating .
this budget is not even extravagant .
firstly , i would like to encourage them to reconsider the importance of russian energy imports and , secondly , to extend the partnership agreement in a way that eu representatives could participate as observers in the elections to be held in december this year and in the presidential elections to be held in march 2013 .
against this background , i feel that we need simple rules for accessing the structural funds so that european money can reach beneficiaries as quickly as possible .
i have received copies of bills where people have been in another country for three or four days and have to pay several thousands of euros just because they have downloaded their favourite television show or newspaper articles , which they are used to utilising .
no less important is the acknowledgement of georgia 's and ukraine 's transatlantic aspirations .
just like me , at the beginning of this term of office , you had the option of choosing from which coffers your daily allowances would be paid : from the uk coffers or from those of the european union .
my report deals with numerous deficiencies and puts forward proposals in the hope that the commission will perhaps be able to include some of them in its legislative proposal that it will be tabling in the autumn .
for this reason every citizen of the union must comply with the laws of the union ; as commissioner frattini said just now , freedom of movement does not mean freedom of crime without borders .
the agriculture sector 's susceptibility to market instability and price volatility must be addressed and the cap should guarantee a safety - mechanism and provision for effective risk prevention , which would give farmers a measure of income security in these economically trying times and serve to provide foresight of how global price volatility will affect developing countries .
we hungarians belong to a relatively small nation , but we are proud to have 50 nobel prize winners , mostly in the natural sciences .
it also recommends that prison staff should be trained in , and made more aware of , this issue .
( de ) madam president , the ink is barely dry on the abortive treaty of lisbon and already the next amendments have been tabled , and the chaos surrounding our new members - people are talking about phantom members - is truly perfect .
the scientific information cannot be disputed .
the changes to the global situation regarding the production , trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs is worrying .
the budget is not intended for this purpose and this would not be possible either in political or legal terms .
hezbollah is stronger after the attack on lebanon , and hamas is stronger today in gaza .
2008 discharge : eu general budget , court of justice
on behalf of the ppe - de group . - ( de ) mr president , the report provides clarification for which i would like to express my sincere thanks to both rapporteurs , messrs lamassoure and severin .
i think it is fair to recognise that , although serious concerns remain and need to be addressed , china has also made remarkable progress in the human rights field over the last year .
( sl ) thank you very much , mr president .
i hope that the commission undertakes , through this now imminent measure , to defend life in the mediterranean against the attacks of multinationals and governments who are complicit and care little about our collective welfare .
that is a conditio sine qua non .
in accordance with our rules of procedure , i would like to ask members who are speaking not to quote other members , for the simple reason that under the rules they could ask to speak later .
