30 % of police officers , 30 % of schoolteachers and 30 % of doctors have lost their jobs .
If we do not talk about world trade rules we will resolve nothing : that is to say , in the face of this systemic crisis we must reform the system , restoring to politics that steering role that is too often lacking , refocusing attention on the real economy and abandoning the easy opiates of virtual finance !
In the year in which we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Atlantic Alliance , it is time to rethink its strategic concept and bring it into line with the new reality .
Finally , it should be emphasised that the Council has , in a certain sense , ratified Parliament 's amendments while allowing for plenty of discussion on the social consequences both for employees of services and for consumers .
For this reason , I do not think that we need any new legislation in the field of energy ; instead , I think we should focus more on implementing the existing legislation .
We know that it is the most heavily militarised area in the world . We know that this also is an area where there are arrests and significant detention without trial .
The amendments that I and my fellow Members proposed , and which were approved by a large majority in the Committee on Regional Development , will allow the old Member States , and not only the new ones , as the original draft proposed , to be able to benefit as well from this possibility of financing .
If necessary , the European Union ought to be ready to continue this mediation .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today , Europe must face up to a new dimension of problems such as terrorism , cyber threats and trafficking in human beings and drugs .
With interruptions such as this , however , the debate becomes more interesting .
( SK ) Madam President , I regard it as very important from a political perspective that the guidelines for the 2012 budget reflect the economic and political circumstances under which it was drawn up .
This first assessment of the national action plans is a point of reference for dialogue in the EU and a useful tool allowing the Member States to turn the spirit of energy efficiency into pragmatic measures that will produce the expected results by 2020 .
The directive itself contains mechanisms to ensure the specificities of these services are taken into account .
Composition of political groups : see Minutes
In 1997 , this Dutch entrepreneur was charged with breaching the Polish taxation rules .
They will explain the obstacles they face .
At the heart of the three main challenges facing the European Union , namely growth , employment and the recognition and satisfaction of people 's needs , are 490 million consumers .
I would say , now that the European Union is a Community of 27 Member States and 480 million inhabitants , that management and administration need to be simplified and made more efficient .
The current sluggish handling of the situation clearly gives a sign of the weakness and inability of the organisation to adequately implement the goals it has set itself .
Regarding the question of my presidency 's ambitions in relation to world trade liberalisation , the presidency has clearly defined its main priority on this subject in the context of the Council 's 18 - month programme for the French , Czech and Swedish presidencies , as well as in its own work programme , which was published last week and was also introduced here to some extent by the Prime Minister today .
Even if there is unanimity on the fact that there can be no return to unbridled developments on the financial market , the methods and extent of regulation are still the subject of fierce argument .
The European Parliament , being the cautious budgetary authority that it is , remains within the agreed boundaries ( one fifth of the budget of the institutions ) , but invests in knowledge nevertheless , by increasing staffing levels within the groups and by increasing capacity in the library .
A global approach is totally consistent with the objective of protecting health and the environment more effectively while allowing for trade in products .
- ( SK ) We often hear it said these days that nobody can make a tree grow to the sky .
As I said , it is a bilateral matter which , of course , falls within the competence of the countries that are concluding these agreements .
Finally , I wish to welcome the acknowledgement given to the role of the Structural Funds in achieving the strategy 's objectives .
To ensure that this authority runs smoothly and is properly integrated into the overall framework of financial regulation , it became necessary to amend Regulation ( EC ) No 1060/2009 .
This is an important step and a positive development on their way towards European integration .
Someone has to take the lead in tackling the issue , and it is quite naturally the European Union 's place to take the lead .
The energy sector is an obvious example of this .
Adapting to a dynamic economic reality also means ensuring a high level of protection of workers ' rights in close cooperation with social partners .
In the context of the present economic crisis , the revival of the EU economy has become a very important topic , and this will be achieved through sensible investments , which are vital to economic success , scientific discoveries , technological innovation and jobs .
However , I think that support from the European Social Fund must be based on solidarity .
Continual retrenchment in police services at the same time as borders are being eliminated is counterproductive , and not only in this area .
Consolidating tax bases at an EU level would not make the difference suggested by the rapporteur .
It is worth emphasising that such an order would only have a preventive effect .
Adults and senior citizens who pass on knowledge and technical know - how to younger people , particularly expertise in a trade or in business practice , can play an effective supporting role .
I also think that we have learned a lot from what happened last year .
For these reasons , the Commission does not envisage the implementation of 100 % scanning in EU ports .
But I fully understand their abominable behaviour .
the oral question to the Commission by Jan Marinus Wiersma , Hannes Swoboda , Katalin Lévai , Adrian Severin and Jan Andersson , on behalf of the PSE Group , on a European Roma strategy ( O - 0081/2007 / rev. 1 - B 6-0389/2007 )
Therefore , the defence of European farmers ' interests must be a priority , and I am pleased in this respect that the document includes some paragraphs guaranteeing reciprocity for European farmers by means of the request for the same requirements that are imposed on European farmers to be applied to exporters of meat to Europe in order to guarantee consumer safety and fair commercial competition .
( SL ) In answer to Mr Pirker : it is a fact that procedures to include the Swiss Federation and the Principality of Liechtenstein in the Schengen area have already begun .
A number of people were put in the dock and no new facts emerged .
At the summit , we must reiterate that the six - point agreement on Georgia has still not been implemented .
I would remind you that the creation of a unitary patent will bring advantages for users of the patent system in Europe and , in particular , it will allow small and medium - sized enterprises , which are often neglected , to improve their competitiveness through improved access to protection via the patent as well as a reduction in costs .
In coping with all these duties , the European Union should not only preserve its strategic connection with NATO but should also be able to make its intellectual and political contribution with regard to maintaining NATO 's ability to deter , and its ability to defend Member States against any aggression , in a context different from the one which determined the birth of the alliance .
We should also know that the report of the United Nations special rapporteur speaks a very clear language .
Micro - credit is also a very important means of improving the economic status and independence of women , not least for women from minority groups .
Written declarations included in the register ( Rule 123 ) : see Minutes
At the same time , Moody 's has downgraded Greece 's credit rating to the same level as Angola ; this was unwarranted and is unacceptable .
At the end of June a new EU - Russia Agreement is finally to be negotiated in Siberia .
We also need to negotiate with Russia in connection with issues relating to the partnership and cooperation agreements and energy security now that Russia - wrongly , not rightly - has withdrawn from the energy charter .
Consequences of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon for ongoing interinstitutional decision - making procedures (
If it can happen in Australia within two hours , then one day should be entirely feasible in Europe .
This leads to many wrong decisions , especially by those less well off .
( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mrs Batzeli and Mr Deß , we all know that the proposed amendments to the regulation on the CMO in sugar aim to make participation in the Community sugar industry more attractive under the restructuring regime so as to achieve the target of reducing Community sugar production .
If not , our ship owners will be put at an unfair competitive disadvantage , and the objectives of preservation and sustainable management of fisheries resources will be seriously compromised .
Mr President , I greet you on behalf of a small American republic , in which just over 4.5 million people dare every day to live and to dream ; in which the ideal of a society without an army has been possible , and in which we will soon be celebrating 110 years of democracy .
Mr President , this is an important dossier , and I am disappointed that the Council is not here , because it now has a crucial role to play as the direction of its thinking is , I understand , rather different from that of this Parliament .
The trade preferences were granted for a period ending on 31 December 2010 and cover the following countries : Bosnia and Herzegovina , Serbia and Kosovo .
( PL ) Mr President , I am one of the Members of this House who will not be congratulating you on the success of this six - month Presidency .
( LV ) Thank you , Mr President .
The euro exchange rate with the dollar and sterling is not softening and not likely to soften with the divergence between the US and euro interest rates .
We hope that this initiative will promote constructive dialogue on the matter .
Mr Gbagbo should go away .
That shortage is already having and will continue to have serious effects on the prices of milk and hence milk products , as well as on the prices of various other food products .
He said that the Canadian Government would also promise increased political monitoring and a greater military presence in Canadian Arctic waters .
This mismatch between word and deed will prove fatal to the European Union unless radical changes are made to our policy and attitudes .
Commissioner , you have , furthermore , not provided a very detailed answer to the question relating to funding and potential compensation for the airlines .
Specifically with a view to meeting the challenges of globalisation , the European Union must adhere to its core principles , as the only way to safeguard its competitiveness in the long term .
I would very explicitly like to thank my fellow members , the shadow rapporteurs and , of course , Mr Florenz , the rapporteur , for their excellent cooperation , thanks to which we have been able to table a coherent text .
The European Parliament also wanted to be informed about the Commission 's intentions concerning staff redeployment to address the priorities of the new Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management and , more particularly , those policies supported by Parliament during the negotiations .
I would like to express one more wish for the future above and beyond the Lisbon Treaty .
It is , however , preferable to increase quotas even if only by 2 % than to make no changes at all .
What obstacles can the EU erect to prevent gambling operations in Member States ?
Transfers of defence - related products (
Particular attention must be given to the victims of the most repressive cultural , social and political systems .
Why not also give financial support to the Gdańsk Shipyard , which symbolises the end of the Cold War and the liberation of the whole of Central and Eastern Europe from the yoke of Communism ?
I can guarantee that the revision will extend far beyond European principles on freedom of movement .
The one aspect that I really want to focus on is the recovery plan so far .
That was more or less its original raison d'être .
On this matter , as your resolution underlines , we have had a number of meetings at technical level with Belarusian experts on matters of mutual interest , such as energy , transport and environment .
Keeping to the budget is a philosophy common to Parliament and the other institutions , and particularly during an election year we should avoid presenting the European institutions as excessively ambitious as regards the cost to the European taxpayer .
This statement bears testimony to the potential for misuse of the arrest warrant by the judiciary .
What can Europe learn from this crisis ?
I wanted to mention this first .
I want to ask for calm from the parties .
They are the record unemployment of almost 20 % and a public deficit of almost 11 % in Spain .
We must strive to prevent highly educated people from leaving their own countries in massive numbers , thereby causing economic damage , but it should certainly not be about opposing immigration into Europe by definition .
In addition , this report ensures legal certainty for our entrepreneurs , who will know that for the next five years , European legislation will prevent the standard rate of VAT from rising .
They bring an end to the impunity of owners of hulks , and inspections will be made even more effective by being targeted at such ships .
A strong Europe , which is a Europe that will cope with the global competitive environment , is achieved by maintaining the cohesion policy as a key element in EU policies , aimed at achieving balanced development in every region .
Governance and partnership are two key issues in reviving the Single Market .
Solving the political , economic and social issues can make the environment peaceful , less subject to inter - ethnic tension and able to reject the acts of violence that , tragically , we have seen become more frequent over the last decade .
Even though this pathogen should not primarily be treated with antibiotics , we have the problem that it is resistant to many common antibiotics .
This is a reflection of the confidence in European institutions which exists in Spain , and a reflection of the work we have done in Spain .
Without more rapid force generation , be it police , prosecutors , or military , it will be very difficult to act at the rhythm , at the speed , that is required in crisis management .
As regards the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , 2009 was a good year as regards its reform process .
( HU ) An ever - increasing number of scientists in the world are saying that a severe oil , water and food shortage will develop simultaneously by 2030 .
However , we must not forget that Member States have voiced their opposition to such a directive because it does not come under the EU 's jurisdiction .
The Greek Communist Party voted against this particular report , underlining that the only popular way out of the capitalist crisis is to target the profits of the monopolies .
I believe that the Irish vote will have an important impact on the way in which we build Europe , especially in the months to come , inasmuch as it proves the deep attachment of our peoples to the values which Europe represents .
Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation and the work that we did together , as well as thanking the rapporteurs for the opinions of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , and of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality .
( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , in Parliament I represent citizens of the Czech Republic , who were just mentioned .
This leads me , President - in - Office , to call on you too to support the commitments we have made internationally with the ITER , or fusion , project .
In countries where women have the right to choose abortion , this rate fluctuates at around 200 .
The situation will largely be resolved by amending national provisions to take account of developments .
Mr President , as stated in the text of the oral question that we have tabled , in the last three years , we have seen an escalation of the situation detrimentally affecting European Union interests and citizens in the southern Sahara , which has become a haven for the Islamic branch of al-Qaeda , with a whole string of murders , kidnappings , extortion , blackmail , drug trafficking and people trafficking , the victims of which have been German , Italian , Spanish and , most recently , French citizens .
Furthermore , the Council has just started the examination of the Commission 's action plan for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems ( ITS ) in Europe and the associated proposal for a directive laying down the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport .
Sometimes I get the impression that , when it comes to these issues , things happen in a similar way to the monitoring of the fishing quotas : each side pushes a little towards the other and there is not , in the end , an efficient system .
Mr President , when my constituents ask me about the main benefit of being part of the European Union , my reply is always the free trade that exists between nations and the internal market that we are seeking to complete .
An agreement on the regulation of risk capital , a regulation on the supervision of financial markets and a budget for 2011 .
We will compare notes on the G 20 results , especially financial and banking reforms and the need to deliver a global trade deal , and look for EU - US added value there .
I would like to stress that in combating this difficult disease , it is vital to pay much attention to prevention and to target efforts at obtaining the earliest possible diagnosis .
- Report : Liese
That was the conclusion reached by the European Council in June 2006 , when it called on the European Union and its Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development .
I shall tell you why .
There needs to be a differentiation between micro , small and medium - sized businesses .
Conclusion of the Statute of the International Renewable Energy Agency ( IRENA ) (
Is there something the Commission can do - maybe by making a plea , at the next summit , to our national governments to show a bit of European solidarity ?
Lumping all these services together , which is what repeatedly happens in this House , is risky , in my view .
Member States will then be able to integrate in taxes or tolls levied the actual costs incurred by traffic - based air and noise pollution , whereas up to now , only infrastructure - related costs could be charged .
Regulation of the transport of dangerous goods is important for our transport system .
At this time of year we start to hear of tragedies in which hundreds of migrants have drowned and since we well know what happens , it is good to ask whether we are better prepared this year to meet the challenge of illegal migration .
What we found in this institution from all spectrums , from left and from right , was that you gave us a forum when nowhere else gave us a voice to speak .
This is a truly European issue and now is not the time for national egoism .
Concerning the question of the Azores , the Portuguese authorities have used any opportunity to ask for increased milk quotas for the islands because of the fact that the Azores seem to be extremely competitive and seem to be benefiting from the increased production .
- ( FR ) Madam President , excuse me , but I do not understand why there should be a time limit .
This is essential for reasons of competitive neutrality , and also because two thirds of CO 2 emissions come from intercontinental flights rather than flights within Europe .
The fight against corruption and aid for the poorest - that is our moral duty and a long - term interest of the EU .
However , a distinction must be made between purely bureaucratic matters and cases where rights may be called into question .
Just as in the financial sector , the Member States will not achieve any concrete results in supporting growth unless they cooperate closely with each other , and , beyond that , with their major international partners .
Our role is to take care to ensure that our societies are safe .
Mr Frattini , the process to bring this to the House has been long and laborious , but there can be no doubt it will be well worth voting for the final result tomorrow .
Agreement could have been reached .
The rapporteur sets as target 125 grams of CO 2 per km in 2015 .
It is clear that we are tackling the effects of the problem and not the causes .
I would therefore like to state for the record that the amendment made to Article 2 ( 2 ) ( a ) with the wording ' except wild game ' must always be considered in conjunction with point aa .
The IND / DEM Group was , of course , formed to oppose the European Constitution , and we have been very successful , having spent money on the ' no ' campaigns in the French , Dutch and , most recently , Irish , referendums .
We have just entered trialogue and we already have a new legislative proposal from the Commission , again to amend the regulation .
Furthermore , maternity leave must be guaranteed for all women .
In order to attain this objective , the most isolated regions of the Community , such as the Baltic Sea region , need to be better integrated into the European energy market .
Congratulations and thanks to Mrs Ana Maria Gomes on the report .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
Mr Oettinger , you are in the process of drawing up the Energy Roadmap 2050 .
With regard to energy policy , we in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance also believe it is important not to forget human rights and to neglect the human rights dialogue when we discuss energy .
We are doing it because real peace can only be created when there is justice for the victims - and there are victims not just with Pakistani or Indian passports .
The Commission proposed the inclusion of three modules .
Typhoon Morakot swept across the island with unbridled force , leaving more than 750 people dead .
( NL ) Just like many other people , I also think there should be a statute for MEPs ' assistants as soon as possible .
The Commission should launch infringement proceedings and penalties against Member States that do not apply , or only partially apply , the regulations on the Structural Funds .
In addition , we need to inform citizens that infringements of EU law can be challenged before the national courts concerned as well .
We have included important proposals .
When a producer consciously uses the CE marking , he is saying that he abides by EU rules .
Once again , history is repeating itself , in all its horror , on Europe 's doorstep .
On the other hand , we have a very important signal .
( NL ) I , too , intended to vote in favour of the Záborská report because it was , all in all , an even - handed report that does not lapse into the traditional , politically correct clichés when it comes to matters such as discrimination or what is meant by it .
It would be good if this could be corrected .
I would like to highlight the following absolutely essential aspects in specific areas : the urgent need to implement the single European sky in the aviation sector , the urgent need to implement interoperability in the railway sector , expanding and improving road infrastructures and safety on European roads in the road transport sector , achieving comodality in inland ports and expanding the ' motorways of the sea ' for sea and river transport , and the urgent need for the sustainable development of urban mobility .
Encourage Member States to adopt a system of ' opting out ' rather than ' opting in ' to organ donation .
I shall not mention the more specific aspects of the dispute settlement procedure described in the text of the amendment - Mr Botopoulos has in any case covered this aspect accurately and thoroughly .
It would have merited this and it would also reassure us that you think it is as important as you are now saying .
I am counting on the full support of both arms of the budgetary authority so that Europe can swiftly provide the necessary aid to farmers , particularly those in Africa , in close cooperation with the competent multilateral organisations .
Unfortunately the current tax system in EU Member States does not favour implementation of the Lisbon Strategy .
This is why I am actually encouraging the European Investment Bank to continue the measures aimed at promoting economic and social cohesion in the European Union and the measures to combat the financial crisis by increasing ...
The countries in Africa need to be able to see that the first measures are already in progress .
I am thinking , in particular , of the work undertaken by Mrs Ferreira .
I call on the Commission to take this initiative .
Achieving an agreement in Copenhagen will give the necessary impetus for coordination at global level of the actions to be taken against climate change .
Whilst reiterating , Mr President , Commissioner , fellow Members , our desire and will to cooperate and always be on good terms with the Commission , we have no choice but to reject the conduct to which I have referred .
In spite of the severe effects that the economic crisis is having on the European labour market , industrial and technological change increases the need for workers with high and intermediate skill levels .
Mr Itälä and Mr Fleckenstein have already referred to this .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , the idea of a one - stop shop is to be welcomed , but it is a paradigm shift for some European countries - including my own , Austria , where residence permits are issued by the authorities dealing with third - party rights and work permits by the authorities responsible for the labour market , the Austrian Employment Service , with the involvement of the social partners .
Nevertheless , in making changes to frequency spectrum policy , we must also bear in mind international agreements on the freeing up of different frequencies at an international level .
That is a second observation that we will perhaps have to come back to in our opinion , as I have said to Mr Brok and Mr Gualtieri , the two rapporteurs for our committee .
This is where Europe can make the difference .
This House needs a reality check .
This is always the Commission 's proposal . We cannot always get it through in the final procedures when the legislator is finalising the negotiations on the Commission 's proposal , but this is possible in Parliament and the Council .
Courage and prudence should always go together .
That can be an added value provided by the European Union .
I had the honour of meeting representatives of different political parties , senators and members of parliament .
This is happening as we here in Europe are bending over backwards to accommodate the endless sensibilities of Muslim believers .
The Council 's commitment to reduce , by 2020 , the total Community greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 % in comparison with 1990 levels , or even by 30 % if other developed countries commit themselves to similar reductions , is an ill - judged move which will have a negative impact on industry and consumers in Europe , including in Poland .
This is because Mrs Klamt has had a close family bereavement .
There is no point arguing about that : savings will be made .
It really puts the Union on the map .
That work must deepen and grow .
That is most regrettable .
For example , unlike last year , we can state that the Court of Auditors did not present an entirely clean statement of assurance , but pointed out a number of problems , for example regarding evidence of transactions which could have been better documented and regarding payments from different delegations .
This will allow European airlines to fly to all destinations within the United States .
Secondly , they will point the way towards emerging policy objectives where the Commission and Parliament should work together .
The Commission has already carried out a wide - ranging consultation , thereby demonstrating its intentions within the context of its broader strategy for a global Europe , intentions that we support .
Nor do we have to do anything supernatural - we must simply stipulate that agricultural products imported into the European Union should be subject to the same environmental , social , animal welfare and safety standards that European farmers are obliged to observe .
However , when I was there I was impressed by the vibrant and free media and the determination of the people to overcome their difficulties .
Thus , this sector is not really affected at all .
However , this proposal also has flaws , and I am certain that the European Parliament will address these tomorrow with numerous amendments .
( FI ) Mr President , I would like to say a few words about this budget , revenue and expenditure .
The post has been advertised once , six months ago .
As to financing , this is the second thing I would like to say in reply to one important question .
This is what the European Parliament , and then the Council , believed in 2007 when it recommended that the European Commission draft a Baltic Sea Strategy and an action plan .
I hope you will accept this apology in the spirit in which it is made .
' Never more ' would mean : Let 's go this far again .
The Committee on Transport and Tourism and its rapporteur have , we hope , improved it .
The establishment of a ' blacklist ' surely needs more discussion regarding the means of implementation , for this is another area in which data protection has a key role to play .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( ET ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
For awareness of organ donation to flourish circumstances apparently dictate that EU policy , and the commercialisation of health , welfare , and human needs must be opposed .
In the preparation of the Commission proposal , as well as during the negotiations , we have been clearly guided by the scientific evidence on the importance of the continuous effort to improve air quality , and specifically on the need to address the fine particles ( PM 2.5 ) .
I would also like to make clear to each of the speakers that I appreciated the high standard of the debate on such an important matter - a matter in which Europe must set an example - both by guaranteeing effective collective protection against terrorist threats and also , of course , by remaining very attentive to the protection of individual freedoms and personal autonomy .
This is a task which still faces us , although many countries have now invested billions in this area and have been looking for a reliable solution for 30 years .
Compliance with international election standards demonstrates that Ukraine is taking the path to a mature democracy and closer cooperation with the EU , based on mutual respect for the fundamental values of the EU .
The discussion about the EUR 1 500 increase in the secretarial allowance is symbolic for the issue of whether we are able to slim down our structures , save funds and make our working processes more efficient .
The report on the progress made by Croatia in 2007 supports the belief that this country , by implementing the goals facing it , is taking an active approach to the accession process .
Mr President , I ask you to hold a minute 's silence in memory of Marek Rosiak , a man who died while working for the European Parliament .
That cannot , in any event , disguise the tragic situation of over a million people caught in the crossfire .
And today we are off to the next wedding , this time in Lisbon : splendid atmosphere , wonderful city , no Cohn - Bendit - everything just as it should be .
Mr President , I am also a member of the Delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries , and , indeed , Lebanon is in a tragic situation .
There are precedents , however : for six or seven years I was personally involved in an attempt , along with the Organization for Security and Co - operation in Europe ( OSCE ) and the Council of Europe , to bring about dialogue involving the government of Belarus and the then opposition .
The Member States need to find a way through their differences in order to start carrying out our commitment to the region .
The earth is becoming too small and many experts have already discovered the significant potential of the oceans .
The recent protests in several Arab countries show that non - democratic and authoritarian regimes cannot ensure credible stability , and that democratic values have a key role in economic and political partnerships .
Unfortunately , the sustained development of new technologies , and particularly of the Internet , is resulting in the increasingly frequent use by businesses of unethical and dishonest practices in the field of advertising .
The third point is that , in order to find a long - term solution in Somalia , the Council lends its full support to the Djibouti process within the transitional Federal Government and the Alliance for the Re - liberation of Somalia , and there is no plan B to this process .
The framework of the budget is not very flexible , and it is difficult to reallocate resources .
I think that we should help Serbia and we must not forget that this country recently came out of a war .
The few chapters that are left until negotiations can be concluded should be closed before the middle of the year .
The common will to work towards the same direction in terms of the European project is what counts , as was repeatedly said at the December European Council .
Even in countries such as the Netherlands , which have always been known for their international solidarity , voices are heard in favour of cutting development expenditure .
It is another matter again when it comes to works protected by copyright .
This leads me to what the Committee on Economic Affairs has rightly brought into the report : completing the internal market is in itself great consumer policy .
Together with the European arrest warrant , this means that anyone is liable to be arrested and sentenced in any EU Member State in which they have been tried and sentenced by default , without ever being told or realising that proceedings have been brought against them .
Fourth : the legality of the agreement .
I trust that Parliament will give its full support to the report and that the Commission and Council will take matters forward in the manner it recommends .
In addition , vague , controversial concepts like ' self - governance ' and ' cultural autonomy ' also have the potential to cause conflict .
As a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Rapporteur on the Black Sea cooperation , I would like to focus on an important aspect to be promoted in the EU foreign policy .
Apart from that some other provisions also need to be harmonised with the European standards .
In my opinion there are three areas that are most important as regards bringing stability to Ukraine and also benefit to the European Union .
We are very good at research ; we are very good at science ; but where we have difficulty is in converting these wonderful ideas that have revolutionised the world into tangible products .
I would like to stress that the new DCI should provide a basis for targeted and more flexible aid in situations of fragility .
The Energy Charter Treaty is especially important because it is the basis of European cooperation on energy matters , and Russia too must ratify it .
in writing . - I wanted to vote for this report on UN priorities for the 64th Session of the UN General Assembly because many of the priorities are worthy and should be supported and even promoted .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Carvalho for this very comprehensive report .
It is in this context that I support measures that will incentivise environmental best practices in the problematic region of Campania , in Italy .
We should also look at good practice in other EU countries , for we could devise a much better long - term policy to tackle alcohol - related harm .
A truly effective additional sanction could also be introduced for countries failing to adhere to the stability pact .
We need to define a strong common position and ensure the European Union 's active participation in future international negotiations .
( FR ) Mr President , last week the package of legislation on climate change and energy was presented .
I would not like to see this compromise package being unwrapped again .
A vote for discharge does not mean that the situation is totally ideal .
I would like to thank him very much for this personal kindness , as Pessoa is one of our great poets and I would like to quote Pessoa again : he once spoke about ' a nostalgia for the future ' .
A committee meeting may be held , even on Thursday , but without taking a vote .
They are asking questions like : ' How are we going to get the markets under control in the near future ? ' .
We do not want everyone trying to go their own way .
Dick Marty has worked with very great commitment here , and I would like to express my thanks to him .
Otherwise I welcome the agreement of the Council on the energy package .
The effort of many people combined to produce this success .
Unfortunately , there are only a few of us here .
My second point is the climate agenda , where , of course , the Commission 's efforts have also been extremely important In my view and that of many of my colleagues in the PPE , the climate change area is where the European Union has been most successful .
My government is certainly working with the aim of reducing social exclusion , creating the basis for self - determination through work , and ensuring that more people are in work .
It was a very inclusive process .
As long as people comply with the rules of the Posting of Workers Directive they have the right to work anywhere in the EU .
I think it is important that the public can monitor the situation , because it is very clear that it is public money that is given to NGOs and the process should be completely transparent .
It is important to remember that Community funding for research is awarded to beneficiaries on the sole criterion of the scientific excellence of their proposals .
As regards the point made by Mrs Miguélez Ramos , who wanted a further extension to the two specific instances in the Atlantic and in the Adriatic , these are specific , small and inconsequential cases .
The European Court of Human Rights in the EU will perhaps impose minarets and burkas on Europe , and some proceedings are already under way ; is , conversely , the crucifix to disappear from school walls and perhaps subsequently from first - aid boxes , seals , coats of arms and national flags ?
We were faced with two undesirable alternatives , either a shorter agreement with higher fish quotas or a longer agreement with lower fish quotas .
the consideration of production costs in the definition of guide prices ;

Another area in which the Alliance is eager to collaborate is the Union for the Mediterranean in order to help improve and manage intercultural diversity and intercultural dialogue , including inter - faith issues , within and among European and Muslim societies and communities .
Clearly , I shall pass over the question of the responsibility for all this .
And what thanks did they get ?
However , we do have serious misgivings on the issue of the reversal of the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the accused .
It used to be that countries could fix a higher price .
The picture needs to be big when it comes to innovation , too , but sometimes the answer is to be found in the small things .
The climate change and energy package , for example , has had so many derogations that it is practically devoid of substance , due to the crisis .
We know how important independent journalism is in every society .
What impact will the fight against poverty have on your 2020 Strategy objective , when we learn that , today , within the European Union , 116 million people were threatened by poverty or social exclusion on the basis of figures valid for 2008 ?

Srebrenica and its terrible tragedy are not only the most recent instance of human horror .
Therefore , if we reduce obligations , we reduce costs , and by reducing costs , we make it easier for them to operate .
Instead , it is time for Turkey to send positive signals to the EU .
I believe that we can best measure the progress we have made by what we set as the goal at the beginning of the debate .
We should also recognise that ongoing reforms carry new risks as they make future pensions far more dependent on long - term developments in the labour market and financial markets .
The situation may be improving , but only very slowly .
Indeed , 99 % of all businesses in Europe are SMEs , providing more than 100 million jobs .
That is the very least that the citizens of Europe can expect .
A clause has been included in the agreement about the compulsory publication of correlation tables , which I called for in my report on internal market scoreboards , and binding time limits for implementation of directives , which should not exceed two years .

Now , in the Council , where is our ' put a man on the moon ' project in Europe ?
Finally , I would like to thank the European Commission for its promptness in approving the funding for the four energy projects which Romania is also involved in .
This will enable Parliament to state clearly and unambiguously that discrimination can no longer be tolerated and that Parliament considers the rights of all its citizens equally important .
I expect it to evolve into a more transparent institution and to work even more closely with Parliament and the Commission .
This , too , is something that the Commission cannot do by itself .
However , the Commission is keen to make sure that this initiative , if it were to be approved by the European Council , does not undermine our efforts to build on the success of the Lisbon Treaty and , most of all , does not undermine its certification .
Yet , at the same time , economic and trade relations between the European Union and Russia are strong , and getting stronger .
We supported you when others did not and we supported you because of your longstanding reputation as a reformer .
If there is one area in which Europe excels , it is in the creation of agencies , bodies and all kinds of structures , provided with staff and a budget , which justify the Union 's action and give the appearance of wanting to resolve the problems .
So the EU could decide if foreign warships are permitted to visit - those of our friends and allies perhaps ?
15 .

Pactio Olisipiensis censenda est !
One of the things that I have said to all the foreign ministers and I say to Parliament is : please resist the temptation to assume that , because the first four or five appointments I make are not from a Member State that you might know best , it does not mean that I will not make appointments in the future from those Member States .

There is then also the question of an interest - rate rebate on loans .

Nor can you find out what happens to your data .
I hope that we can count on the Commission to submit to Parliament an annual report analysing - and ' analysing ' is the key word - the implementation of the agreement .
Madam President , it is true that progress has been made but it has to be said that progress is painfully slow .
A total of EUR 35.6 million has been released from the EU Solidarity Fund to repair this damage .
We fully support Iraq remaining a unified and sovereign state .
They will be saved by taxpayers .
Although far from a binding agreement , but clearly along the lines of a political agreement , the outcome of Copenhagen should lead us to question why it was such a disappointment .
At the end of this month , the EU will discuss the issue of climate change as a matter of priority at the EU - China and EU - India summit conferences .
We have therefore voted against this report in its entirety .
For what purposes ?
Now that fishing is permitted again , it is carried out on the basis of the precautionary principle , and that is the way it should be done .

It also means that massive pressure must be put on the US to bring that country to support this goal .
It is well balanced and gives an objective description of developments in Macedonia ; commending what has been achieved and appealing for a little more time to be devoted to what remains to be done .
( HU ) We have noticed recently that public opinion is following this question with exceptional interest , and particularly those aspects that we , too , are debating , that is to say , the questions of opt - out and of on - call time .

This naturally leads to rising prices and human suffering , which , incidentally , also affects livestock farmers in Europe .
The UK timeshare industry is worth approximately EUR 157 million per year , and this directive constitutes an important move forward in eliminating unscrupulous agents who cause problems for consumers and bring legitimate operators into disrepute .

I am going to turn my attention away from the text again for just a moment .
For , although the proposal has been halted for the moment , the ideas must not be buried .
Secondly , how do the agencies perform against the criteria ?

Among other matters , it will touch upon regional issues , global security , transatlantic economic partnership , and global challenges , including climate change and energy .

Basically , I have just one comment to make , Commissioner , and that is that your background is in regional politics , in a large state in Germany , whereas mine is in local politics .
The latter is of course based on the value of the fundamental entity , namely the human being . European policy should be consistent in every respect as regards handing down and enforcing sentences and the general links between convicted persons and society .

Mr Langen , I asked you last time to bring me proof that you are capable of this sort of basic calculation .

Therefore , the system 's sustainability is an urgent problem .
A sound industrial policy is needed , but not economic nationalism .
Thank you all .
Let us hope , then , that everybody will shoulder their responsibilities .
The main political parties are in complete agreement on this issue . The greater part of society also concurs with this view .

The package that we are voting on today includes provisions that go absolutely in the direction one would wish for the development of the telecommunications market , in an orderly fashion and for the benefit of everybody : a European regulation entrusted to a Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications ( BEREC ) with mixed financing , without a veto ; a balance between competition and the need for new investment - functional separation is limited to exceptional cases ; a desire to focus attention on public services in spectrum management ; new services ; new freedom of access ; and , thanks to Mr Harbour in particular , a considerable increase in the rights of consumers .

I suppose the investigation will give us concrete answers as to what the causes of the accident were and , in many cases , this is a tragic combination of several factors , including human factors .
Nonetheless , I do not believe that we should be engaging in self - righteous meddling in the internal policy affairs of other States , all the more so given that the EU is by no means in a position to assume the role of a model of democracy .
But I believe that it wants to engage with us and we have re - established a recent history of engagement with Pakistan , which I understand is progressing reasonably successfully .
The Commission has played its part , and many Member States have sent aid or teams of experts .

That is my request and there is also a corresponding passage in our motion for a resolution on this subject , so that we can contribute to ensuring that procedures that have proved successful in the Member States can also be guaranteed after the final introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area .
The regulation to be adopted makes it possible to harmonise regional investment and helps joint planning , thus strengthening the energy market and supply security .
The protection of intellectual property rights and geographical indications at global level remains fairly inadequate ; it neutralises the competitive advantage of the high added value of European industrial and agricultural products .

The proposal that EUR 40 million will be spent establishing and staffing an entire office in Malta to deal with asylum seekers across the EU suggests that this Commission wants to make the decisions that should be left to national governments .
There are other aspects , but trade is a very important one , and there is a feasibility study on trade already on the way .
Because if we operate and play games of chance via the internet then the profits are created elsewhere and not in the countries the players come from .
These included : the need to duly consider the accessibility handicap affecting regions with specific natural or geographical characteristics , such as the outermost regions ; the need for the renewed EU tourism policy to make European tourism sustainable in economic , social , territorial , environmental and cultural terms ; the promotion of Europe as a tourist destination or a collection of attractive tourist destinations ; the need to coordinate the policies with a direct or indirect impact on tourism ; closer cooperation among the stakeholders in the sector - the European Commission and the Member States , the regions , local authorities and tourism services - and better use of existing European financial instruments .
I await the reactions to this before my second turn .

No mention was made of the willing and free exchange between buyer and seller in order to produce the profit which can then be reinvested to create jobs .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament and the European Commission for their creative cooperation .
I believe the Commission has made the right choice of areas in which partnerships should be established with the countries which are in these associations with us .
As for the ' fair value ' principle , it favours a short - term approach and makes financial results the dominant factor in company management .
Any legal proposal will also aim for a smooth transition for those areas which may lose their status of areas with a natural handicap .
Thank you ; it is a good sign .
My group therefore expects the European Council to go beyond words and to give serious consideration to our common economic objectives on the basis of the Commission 's 2020 proposals , an amended version of which Parliament will propose in June .

I would like to know how the European Commission intends to approach these negotiations and this draft convention , and on the basis of what mandate it will act on behalf of all of us , so that tomorrow , in the area of domestic work , the European Union can set an example and that we , too , can give expression to the values of the European Union .

Given that fact , it is important to enable European citizens to understand , analyse and assess the flood of information and images they receive , so that they can make the best possible use of them .

in writing . - ( PT ) I abstained from voting on my report because , although I recognise the urgency of concluding the agreement and consider this proposal to be positive in part as regards the distribution of fishing licences , and given that it is not feasible to amend it , which is the responsibility of the Council and the Commission , I strongly disagree with the failure to observe the principle of relative stability that has always prevailed in previous agreements .

( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , today 's debate demonstrates once again how important the decision made by the European Parliament on 9 September was , in other words that , in our opinion , France - a Member State - was violating fundamental rights in this instance by discriminating against people on account of their ethnicity , and we called on you to take action .

We must not forget that businesses are bound in Europe by strict social and environmental rules .

I think , for this reason , we need to acknowledge that both Europe and India have many enemies who want to destroy our shared values .
They have good reasons for so doing .
Support relating to job losses , however , is provided in the EU at a European level only in the case of large companies where the job losses are sufficiently high .

Secondly , I would like to highlight what we are referring to as the Mobility Scoreboard , in which we indicate the barriers to mobility in the Member States .

I believe that the elderly deserve a chance , we have this duty !
Let me summarise them as follows : the rule of law , the fight against corruption and organised crime , election legislation , strengthening Parliament 's supervisory role vis - à - vis the government and broader involvement of civil society in interaction with the government , the reform of justice , with continual strengthening of the independence of the judiciary and prosecution , and tackling corruption , which undermines state institutions , economic and social development and the functioning of the public administration .

It is the same foundation for our future and , I must be honest , despite the feelings of friendship we may feel , despite the closeness that I feel towards all the people here , the European Parliament 's position , the position of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the positions of principle adopted by these assemblies , I must say that this prize , the Sakharov Prize , and comments such as those that have been made , are a kind of recurrent leitmotiv , but it also calls for other , pragmatic decisions .

This has not been done so far .

We therefore need to take urgent action : the 2004 Directive must be revised in the light of these results .
The opening up of air space between the US and EU on a non - discriminatory basis should provide improved services for the transportation of passengers and cargo , economic benefits , and above all jobs .
( DA ) Mr President , it is with great pleasure that I am following the renewed interest in green growth that has followed in the wake of the financial crisis .
How are we , as the European Union - and I will make myself absolutely clear : as the European Parliament and Council ; in other words , together with the Member States - supposed to ensure this protection if it is the case that while we , as the European Union , are negotiating with third countries on the forwarding of data - over what data is actually required , the purpose for which it is to be used and the safeguards that are necessary in order to protect this data - at the same time , individual Member States are negotiating with third countries on data ? Especially since we do not even know what data they are talking about , what security standards are being maintained , whether duplicate data is possibly being forwarded , or even whether data is being forwarded that we would not allow to be forwarded at European level .
This consolidation should not , however , hinder competition to the extent of impairing the effective operation of the common market .
For our Group , this means , above all , finally establishing a common legal immigration policy which safeguards the human rights of migrants and offers prospects to people in great need who enter Europe , often risking their lives to do so .
The problem of liquidity and leverage ratios has not been resolved , any more than that of off - balance sheet assets and securitisation .
However , the people in Sarajevo and Banja Luka know what Europe means and they are the ones who need our help .
Two centuries later the Romans said ' man is a wolf to his fellow man ' .
Madam President , I welcome the Commission 's statement tonight and look forward to reading in more detail exactly what is in this package .
in writing . - I voted against the Schengen acquis being extended to encompass Bulgaria and Romania simply because I do not think provisions have been made to make sure they adjoin the passport - free area safely and effectively .
I believe that we are the ones who can still save this planet .
In many of our national parliaments , there are central lobby areas where lobbyists who have appointments can be greeted and escorted to Members ' office areas .
( FR ) Mr President , a few days after the positive referendum in Ireland , I really feel that we can say that we are more European today than we were before .
Yet , we have proof , once again , that supporting authoritarian and corrupt regimes for the sake of stability and preventing chaos usually ends in instability , chaos and the loss of great opportunities for the future .
Steps must be taken beforehand to ensure that the Member States concerned have fully mastered the task of protecting their external borders .
Thank you .
Portugal still has the five longliners it had before .
Some test results from the Agriculture Ministry in Schleswig - Holstein have shown that the fat in the feed contained 77 times the approved amount of dioxin .
Russia imposed tariffs on cars , China restricted food imports , India banned imports of toys and Argentina introduced import licences for textiles and leather goods .
3 .
Given the recent history of my country I have focused in particular on the tragedy of totalitarian Communist rule .
Therefore , I consider that we must prioritise alternative conflict resolution procedures , since they offer more flexibility , as well as simplified and less costly legal proceedings .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to say very quickly that we deplore all the horrors of Darfur and that we all demand that everything be done to ensure that the associations and NGOs , who have a crucial role to play in these cases , can continue their work and are not expelled .
Here we see that there is a report from both the Irish Parliaments .
Unfortunately , the Lagendijk report does not explore such ways thus abandoning any realistic drive towards a better future .
The Gulf Cooperation Council members have now become the economic powerhouse of the Middle East and North Africa region .
As the June List does not consider the EU merely to be a form of cooperation for the benefit of increased growth and trade , but also as a forum for upholding common fundamental human values , we have chosen to vote in favour of the report .
This is no small matter we are dealing with here , as the backbone of Europe is the energy policy .
In a joint motion for a resolution with the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , my group reiterates its unequivocal support for freedom of expression and plurality .
This ought to change .
We should have meetings more often , and that was also one of our joint conclusions .
But if the Council were sincerely interested in the views of the European Parliament it could have been here .
Moreover , resulting from such controls and investigations and the communication of possible cases of fraud or irregularity to OLAF , the honourable Member may be aware that there are regulatory arrangements in place under Regulation ( EC ) No 1681/94 , which provides that the Member States shall report to the Commission , at the appropriate stage , the details of their investigation into such possible cases of fraud or irregularity .
It should be borne in mind that , unfortunately , Africa is a continent where there have been numerous cases of crime and genocide on a frequent basis .
It was an unrestrained attack on workers .
I welcome the issue of Eurobonds .
This has not , however , resulted in an improvement in the ratio of women to men in the sciences .
Russia did the same when it cut off the EU gas section .
Now my last remark is very short . It is about the money .
Where EU offensive interests , such as provincial government procurement , lie in areas of provincial competence , we have been assured that the provinces and territories of Canada will be committed to the negotiations and to the implementation of the agreement .
- Report : Fava
I do not see the point of having air traffic structured mainly around just a few large airports .
I am therefore sad to hear that we have not yet reached that stage , and I am even sadder to learn that the reason for such a state of affairs is that this decision is being linked to another one that gives cause for concern : the lifting of the arms embargo on China .
Jan Mulder 's question as to why these radical proposals come so late was very good .
On the subject of the future of the EUFOR - Althea military operation , we cannot extend it indefinitely .
Recently , I met with the head of the customs authorities in Ireland in Dublin Castle , and she told me that one in every five cigarettes - 20 % of the cigarettes smoked in Ireland , a small country - actually comes via China , and that when they actually seized them and analysed them , they found a mixture of tobacco and canine excrement .
At this time of global instability , the European Union is more important than ever for small Member States like Ireland .
It is very nice of us to say that State aid is not good , but the fact remains that China , Korea , the United States and others give State aid .
I should remind you that international donors have withdrawn the financial support given to the island 's population .
Without the euro , we would be in an extremely difficult situation , with the currencies of weaker countries facing enormous devaluation and the resulting deutschmark facing an impossible increase in value in order to sustain the German and European economies .
None of this promotes the realisation of market relationships .
Nonetheless , the basic message is absolutely correct and the Commission must adopt a much clearer approach here .
What is important is not the methods , it is the guarantee , in all honesty , that we are giving ourselves the means to achieve the objectives .
We were particularly concerned about this , because asylum procedures can take many years in some Member States .
Parliament has done a great job with this resolution , which I hope will be adopted here by a large , unanimous vote , for which we have worked extremely hard .
International labour standards should , above all , ensure workers ' rights , because work is a part of our daily lives and is critical for the dignity , welfare and development of a person .
Coherence between the CAP and EU external trade policy shall ensure the preservation of the European agricultural model , as well as a level playing field for EU producers in the world market .
I urge the House to reject the procedural motion and to allow the voting to take place in the order proposed by you on the voting lists .
Essential prerequisites for this include free and just elections to the Duma and the Presidency , an easier process for registering political parties , which meets European standards , and a fair election campaign which gives all the candidates the same opportunities and access to the public media .
I should , of course , like to support the European Anti - Fraud Office 's means for fraud detection in relation to China and Asian countries , within the ethical code .
( PL ) Madam President , in Mr Tarabella 's report on equality between women and men in the European Union , several very important suggestions have been made to the European Commission and the Member States .
The same quantitative limits may also be applied by Romania and Bulgaria for Swiss nationals during these same periods .
Additional support for redundant workers is also proving necessary in a country that few would imagine would be affected by such hardships , as it is generally regarded as being more able to compete in the global market than most other EU Member States .
We need to create an area of justice , freedom and security for all European Union citizens .
Today I saw on television Sepp Blatter and John Fahey , the Chairman of WADA , discussing how anti - doping and football competitions could go hand in hand after the code of conduct has been adopted , and there is a problem .
Iran , too , is a big exporter of terrorism - to Iraq for example , it is a supporter of Hezbollah and Hamas .
That is why we organised the largest ever quantification , through which we wanted to determine what the actual costs arising from European legal acts and their implementation are for European businesses , insofar as relates to documentation , statistics , information and the like .
Let me say at the outset that some Member States are in , or near to , recession , and we must ask ourselves what is the most important thing we can do in those circumstances .
The political remoteness of the third pillar of the European Union has made it possible for the governments to impose highly controversial restrictions on the fundamental rights of the citizens .
Commissioner Rehn has spoken in somewhat optimistic terms about the negotiations in Cyprus .
That is precisely what has been missing so far or what has not been made sufficiently visible to our citizens .
How can this be prevented ?
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , the Independence and Democracy Group has tried to be helpful , positive and constructive right through this parliamentary term .
These are two sectors which have massive potential in terms of industrial development , innovation , regional development and job creation , and which can increase Europe 's energy security .
It will promote technological progress and , at the same time , it is the first of the supplementary measures being approved which is provided for in the framework of the revised strategy on emissions of carbon dioxide from cars .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to make a few comments with regard to the European integration of Serbia , if I may .
At this time , we are still getting used to the recast rules .
This is particularly the text concerning subcontracting .
It also lies in the potential of communication technologies and , of course , in a common or single vision of energy , as Mr Sosa Wagner said , as this is central to the future of the European Union 's existence .
How can we improve cooperation ?
The Commission 's intervention measures have also succeeded in preventing milk prices from falling even further and the market seems to be relaxing .
At that conference , we will hear about the specific pledges made by the European Union and its Member States .
Therefore , we should analyse our mistakes and not be so arrogant as simply to carry on as before .
I now think that this treaty , for all its weaknesses , still represents substantial progress .
If that aim is to be achieved , national provisions must be harmonised , in addition to repealing unnecessary provisions further to the two options proposed by the Commission .
If it does , we , the Swedish Presidency , intend to have a first discussion among the Member States on it , but it will be up to the Spanish Presidency to really start working on these issues .
This approach is in line with the July 2004 Council conclusions on fisheries partnership agreements , on which Parliament gave its opinion .
I will probably vote against both .
Ways to promote more balanced competition conditions would be to facilitate the exemption from new State aid categories , to promote cooperation , to amend the directive on late payment in order to ensure payment within 30 days , and to remove obstacles to public procurement .
This happened , for example , when we introduced the accelerated withdrawal of single - hull oil tankers and our decision was then followed by a similar one on the part of the International Maritime Organisation .
The market is in fact demanding this of us .
I support this report which will also allow Romania to access funds for facilitating the social inclusion of marginalised people , including Roma , in both urban and rural areas .
Other people have already said it about Europe : no , do not doubt ; wake up , we are stronger .
Our regulation proposes a plan to mitigate the environmental impact of the use of coal in order to offset the negative effects of the aid .
I am pleased , too , that in the Committee on Legal Affairs we managed to negotiate Chapter 5 on unfair contractual terms in a constructive form .
Acquiring linguistic competence should be instrumental in improving one 's qualifications , finding a better job or acquiring new interpersonal contacts .
I think that if we were to link the day solely to the Molotov - Ribbentrop Pact it would not do justice to everything that happened in the 20th century .
Of course we need accountability , but it has reached a stage where there is now a disincentive for local groups to apply for funding .
I would like to ask two more specific questions .
A transparent economy that allows each person to express their talents is an innovative and sustainable economy .
This is primarily due to the fact that the rapporteur , by dint of consummate bargaining skill , great patience and dogged persistence , managed to negotiate and seal a compromise which the entire Committee on Legal Affairs was ultimately able to endorse .
Before introducing a new tax , the European Commission must examine very carefully the pros and cons this tax will entail .
It is very democratic .
And yet the European Community rolled out the red carpet for this man last December at the EU - African summit in Lisbon .
Firstly , this compromise very clearly asserts the freedoms of our citizens as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , including the right of access to the Internet , which is an integral part of freedom of expression and of information .
All these issues should be included in the CAP after 2013 and should be taken into account when it is reformed .
Referring to tradition , subsidiarity and the like in a situation when workers in the European Union are subjected to unbridled exploitation is ridiculous and hypocritical .
The fact that the Tunisian authorities prohibit the wearing of the hijab in public places indicates their determination to protect Tunisia 's values of secularism , tolerance and liberty .
Another important issue for the EU is immigration control .
I am deeply concerned that , whilst sporting events bring joy to millions worldwide , they are also ruthlessly being used as an opportunity to exploit women and girls .
But I take the point very well .
We must drive things forward to ensure that the world reaches the agreement required .
In the islands I hail from , it is the main industry .
While aspiring to be a global power and a global actor , we should change the balance between being a payer , as we are and we want to be , and being a key player in the world arena .
I now submit the 2008 budget for deliberation by the plenary session .
The Commission therefore announced this year that it is to bring forward an ' innovation act ' .

The Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left voted against this report on speculative funds .
That is the way it happens , so Mr Dacian Cioloş is fully included in these discussions .
Under no circumstances should food additives endanger the health of consumers or mislead them , because it is absolutely essential that we guarantee consumer protection and food safety while at the same time maintaining the innovativeness and competitiveness of the food industry .
This is a very important decision that we are about to take .
I certainly welcome the repeal of the metrology directives and cutting red tape by 25 % .
We have voted in favour of Amendments 5 , 8 , 11 , 12 and 13 , and regret that the European Parliament did not go further in relation to accounting transparency , the fight against tax havens and environmental commitments ( ' New Green Deal ' ) .
I should like to say that the position of networks in the future structures of Europe is very important and that these networks are far more important for a cohesive Europe than the ever - growing bureaucracy both in Brussels and in the Member States .
At the same time it is important that the conditions applied in the field of regional policy should relate to fields which cohesion policy can influence , and Member States should not be required to implement essential social and economic reforms in the name of conditionality .
Businesses will not be able to pay it , Member States ' budgets even less so .
However , I regret to say that the priority measures which will give new impetus to the single market and competitiveness do not include any mention of the need to ensure the free movement of all European workers , focusing only on the free movement of services .
In other words , the possibility for at least one million European citizens , both men and women , from the various Member States , to be able to sign a legislative initiative .
In December 2006 the JHA Council was able to green light the start of the process with a schedule of operations worthy of a European version of the film ' Mission Impossible ' and with a minuscule budget , little more than half a million euros .
I take the point about the importance of stability : not only do we have to have it there , but we need to keep it there .
( For the results and other details on the vote : see Minutes )
Your visit is , as it were , the start of the celebrations and I should like to ask you now to address the European Parliament .
Next June , Vice - President Almunia will present to you the Report on Competition Policy 2010 .
A strategic partnership is impossible to implement in full while these massive human rights violations are occurring , and so I would ask that we continue the dialogue but confront the Chinese with what they are doing and not allow any hypocrisy .
We would therefore simply like to emphasise the urgent need for the Member States to ratify it so that it can enter into force as soon as possible .
Area of freedom , security and justice ( vote )
That being so , I wish to make it very clear that if the Commission fails to deliver a substantive response on this issue within the stipulated time limit , I shall propose to the Committee on Legal Affairs that we take proceedings against it in the European Court for failure to act .
They ask whether the EU has nothing more pressing with which to concern itself than saving a couple of threatened orchids or animal species .
They reflect certain conflicts within the blocked Doha development round .
We , as Members of the European Parliament , no longer accept the fact that you are not delivering . '
( NL ) Mr President , there are extremists on all sides , but in recent years they have been dictating the tone and content of the political agenda .
Public confidence in these systems is absolutely vital .
We were also able to invite some critics , although unfortunately they did not all come , because they do not want to subject their criticism to international scrutiny .
This is an indication of a very disturbing trend among opponents of abortion in Europe who are using the aid programme to make their views public .
The figures are alarming .
One has nevertheless to recognise that some of them will face strong resistance , but the Commission will certainly promote them .
In 2009 , the European Union and Japan accounted for approximately 20 % of the world economy and in 2010 , bilateral trade was worth EUR 120 billion .
The issue of regulating working time and the freedom to work longer or shorter hours calls for a response that goes beyond a neo - Marxist or ultraliberal ideology , in favour of a more pragmatic and realistic approach .
However , the Council has always obstructed this .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Madam President , allow me to say , first of all , that today a Spanish fishing boat sank off the Andalusian coast and as a result three people died and five are currently missing .
In any event , we hope that there will be a discussion in the Council , and we urge that this issue be taken very seriously .
I shall , however , focus of course on Parliament 's position .
Already today , and most likely in the coming years , the Member States will be under great pressure to ensure the supply of raw materials .
For this reason there must be a common approach to giving European citizens adequate protection from those risks .
Given the specific organisation of sport , the dialogue must take account of the different levels of sport .

( NL ) Mr President , I would like to ask my fellow Member Hartong the following question . At present , several EU Member States are members of the G 8 , the organisation of the eight largest economies in the world .
Of course , now we are discussing fuel prices .

I think that the recently passed directive or amended directive on company councils constitutes one of the EU 's major contributions in this matter .
I am very grateful to her .
Contrary to what the European Commission is asking , we oppose the idea of reallocating appropriations from the Progress programme to the European Microfinance Facility , because that would send out a negative message to economic operators .
The third energy package forms the basis of this .
There was no conspiracy about it , or at least it was perhaps what H. G. Wells called an open conspiracy , but at no stage have we had the courtesy to ask people whether they want to be citizens of a state with its own legal system .
After all , it has taken a very long time for the promises made so long ago to show the beginnings of the slightest effect .
If not , why not ?
The government guarantees have led to a variety of effects and distortions , such as a reduction in the spread of private loans , as well as an impact on the strategy followed by the pension funds .
I believe , however , that the negotiations concerning lifting the requirement for US visas provide a clear indication of the European Union 's limitations .

The second thing I would like to say is that , as a couple of Members have already said , the CAP is , of course , not ideal .
Four characteristics come to mind .
I agree with the provisions of the regulation which give passengers appropriate guarantees should a journey be cancelled or delayed , even providing for additional compensation .
By adopting , tomorrow , the motion for a resolution on the European Union 's strategy before the Copenhagen Summit , we MEPs must show that we are , firstly , totally determined , and that the summit must culminate in an agreement - one which is precise , certainly , but which is , above all , binding .
We have to name them ; we have to focus on how we can help those who suffer from both .
We must be able to exert pressure on the Commission , but preferably not under such strict time pressure .
7 .

Moreover , with regard to the guidelines adopted by the Commission and the Council , it is clear that there will be a repeat of what happened in 2007 and 2008 , namely , that spending will once again fall short of the limits laid down in the multi - annual financial framework , already insufficient to meet the needs of real social cohesion in the European Union .
I would really like to a very generous position to be adopted in order to establish the European view of these problems even more clearly before the 2009 elections .

Finally , I would like to say a few words about our future action on immigration .
The Socialist and Democrat Group is clear that this interim agreement should apply only for 12 months and that a new agreement should be negotiated with Parliament as co - legislator so that we in this House can ensure that delicate balance of protecting the fundamental rights of European citizens in the important and critical fight against terrorism .
My question was on exactly the same wavelength .
Distortions caused by value added tax ( VAT ) fraud affect the overall balance of the own resource system , which must be fair and transparent in order to guarantee the smooth operation of the Union .
When the EU does impose sanctions they should be precise and well targeted .
Therefore , I ask , at least in this case , that we do not contribute to the further burdening of the legal and economic environment in the European Union .

These people are also excluded from its scope .

I call on the European Commission to consider amending the relevant provisions for the benefit of all Member States of the Union , and in particular for the benefit of the poorest families bringing up children .
Most of what had been achieved has been lost following lobbying by the agrochemical industry and the less efficient among the public regulatory authorities .

It is time that the precautionary principle benefited patients for once instead of always benefiting the companies .

However , it has now become clear that the EU does not have suitable instruments available to deal with this crisis .
The joint culpability of the majority society is also often glossed over .
I believe it would be in their interest to do so .
Mr President , EU enlargement is , at the moment , far less of a priority than in the years leading up to the major enlargement waves of 2004 and 2007 .
Financial assistance should therefore be provided on an individual basis .
The crisis in the graphics sector in the Netherlands has affected a number of the country 's regions , including Noord Holland and Utrecht .
Financial assistance given to workers affected by redundancies as a result of globalisation must be carried out on a case - by - case basis and have their reintegration into the labour market as its goal .

It will replace certain provisions contained in the 12 bilateral agreements on air services between the Member States and the Federative Republic of Brazil This agreement provides the foundation for strengthening relations between the EU and Brazil in the aviation sector , and is expected to bring significant benefits for consumers in terms of lower fares by up to EUR 460 million , as well as new business opportunities for EU airlines .
These are partner states that commit to focusing their policies , and consequently their spending , on the MDG .
On 4 December , Russian public prosecutors organised a raid on the offices of the Memorial organisation , during which a database containing the details of thousands of victims of Stalin 's regime was seized .
I fully support the key points made by Mrs Gomes in the report , i.e. the need for Libya to introduce a moratorium on the use of the death penalty , to ratify the Geneva Convention on Refugees , to actively fight trafficking of human beings , to guarantee fair agreements for illegal migrants and to adopt modern asylum laws .
Look at other countries where this also happened in the past : now they have much more interest in intellectual property rights .
This is a very important step in this process and we now look forward to the Commission proposals in the near future .
Commercial relations between the European Union and Canada can go well beyond the commitments undertaken through the World Trade Organisation as long as they are based on a balanced agreement , a guarantee of proper reciprocal access to each other 's markets and improved protection for trademarks , patents and geographical indications .

Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , many goals have been reached but some battles have not yet even begun .
This increase comes at the cost of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , thus at the cost of French agriculture which , until recent years , was the main beneficiary of the CAP.

I would therefore like to ask whether the Council can tell us what this stream of refugees will mean in terms of what proportion can be included in the resettlement programme .
We have done so in the past , and we should carry on doing it .
Then , to crown it all , there is paragraph 26 , in which you propose following the advice of George Soros !
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
They decided to act for the benefit of their friends in the banks and not for that of the plain people of Ireland .
It will offer the EU the opportunity to act in line with its ambitions , underpinning the Lisbon Treaty 's CFSP provisions - to be not only a payer in conflict situations , but also a player .
The European Parliament 's proposal for investment , based on an agreement reached with the Council , is built on three pillars , namely : interconnection of gas and electricity networks ; carbon capture and storage ; and offshore wind projects .
Most of the children were sentenced for murder , but many sentences seem to be based on unreliable confessions , obtained by torture and during interrogations at which the detained were denied the right of access to a lawyer .
Some people lay the blame at Mr Trichet 's door , others blame Mr Juncker .

The rapporteur , Mr Rasmussen , has taken the initiative and had the vision to propose that hedge funds and private equities , which hold assets amounting to over 4.5 % of world GDP , are not free of responsibility towards society and must be subject to intelligent regulation and supervision .
I would therefore call on you not to make use of the EU institutions to solve problems which should , under our Treaties , be solved at national level .
By trying to simplify and clarify that , hopefully we can also reduce the amount of fraud currently in the system .
Some of these regulations are completely absurd and , in some cases , do not even permit smoking in the open air .
The Uyghurs are supported , in particular , by the World Uyghur Congress based in Munich , and the cultural heritage of Kashgar is supported by the Blue Shield movement , the president of which , Karl von Habsburg , was here in Strasbourg this week to provide us with information .

The work carried out by President Barroso over the last five years was characterised by great pragmatism , seriousness and firmness in the way he looked after Europe 's top interests .
This leads me to draw attention to the considerable misgivings of certain sectors of public opinion , as this accession has come at the wrong time .
It is a strong instrument which will provide a safer haven for victims of violence across Member States ' borders .
We need to do this for the further reason that we need to respond to peoples ' aspirations in Europe and , whatever Nicolas Sarkozy may think , social Europe is a very real issue that you will have to address if you want to avoid being disowned by Europe 's citizens in the very near future .
It will allow increased competition , greater choice for the travelling public .
( ET ) Mr President , inherent in the concept of Europe working together is the idea that , in principle , the euro area can only go in two directions : it can either become stronger or disintegrate .

Action taken on Parliament 's positions and resolutions : see Minutes

The next item is the report by Guy Bono , on behalf of the Committee on Culture and Education , on cultural industries in Europe .
If reforms are made there and if people get down to working on a respectable legal system and on combating bureaucracy , then a European future is realistic , but if that does not happen , then it is not .
It is particularly important that the Swedish Presidency has been so effective in ensuring the completion of the ratification process of the Lisbon Treaty , managing the transition to this new treaty while achieving all the other objectives .
A compulsory written examination in the country of residence has been retained as a requirement to practice this occupation , with the possibility of an exemption for 10 years ' continuous practical experience .
The financial crisis shows what a strong European currency and an effective central bank mean to the protection of the EU 's growth and economy .
Usually , we do not get much further than elegant allusions .
Pushed by poverty , hunger , squalor and war , people will keep crossing the Mediterranean whether they fit our criteria or not .
( IT ) Madam President , once again , we have witnessed the inability of the Italian Government to protect the pro - European reputation of Italy and the interests of its businesses on a crucial point such as the adoption of the European patent .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
The aim of ACTA is to combat large - scale illegal activities , and to protect the European Union 's innovators .
The problem is in fact twofold : there is the ecological problem and then there is the diplomatic problem .
That can lead us to underestimate the significance of this all , however .
In contrast , much more attention should be paid to the traditional ties to Russia .
I would have liked to have seen greater commitment from the Commission in this respect .
And , as we have all experienced in the last two years , this is also a vitally important issue when it comes to energy and foreign relations .
The implementation of a comprehensive Action Plan of the Stockholm Programme that the Commission will be adopting later today is focused precisely on ensuring that the benefits of European integration in the area of freedom , security and justice become more tangible to the citizens .
The measures adopted today will set a precedent for the continuing international negotiations .
We are also keen to see that this policy option , if it is introduced , should be applied uniformly across all transport modes , so that no market distortion takes place .
The common register will be a step forward towards greater transparency in the European institutions , which hopefully will help give the European project greater legitimacy in the eyes of its citizens .
We should remember the inflationary effects of rising food prices .
Oral explanations of vote
We attacked incentive .
The directive also enables the Member States to allow managers to offer alternative funds to non - professional investors as well .
Lastly , this is not a problem of the past .
Previously it was only the industry . Now farmers can say ' I want to leave and I want my EUR 300 per tonne , and I get the compensation for the reduction in prices on top of that ' .
Composition of Parliament : see Minutes
This is a precarious situation and I appeal to Commissioner Malmström to intervene in this issue with urgency .
Shell fishermen in Ireland are being negatively impacted by cheap imports from the United States and Canada due to the weak dollar .
I believe this should be put on the agenda for Copenhagen , but it should also be put on the agenda for the forthcoming European Union summit with India and other summits with the countries affected .
( FR ) Madam President , I have heard a great deal said about industry in this debate , and I would not like Copenhagen to make the mistake of forgetting about agriculture .
Following the shut - down of 34 radio stations , the government of Hugo Chávez officially announced there was a list of other stations which are about to be closed down as well : a list which nobody is aware of because the procedures are not open , and a list over which a great deal of uncertainty hangs , the sole purpose of which is to promote self censorship .
As there has also been a public debate on this issue , I would like to say that this Article 29 , decided by the Council , means that the governments of the Member States take a decision whether to apply the old rules or the new rules to re - elected Members .
Why was nothing said about a real European initiative for the taxation of financial transactions ?
You can rest assured that the Council officers who are here will pass on to the Presidency all the comments that you have made and that other Members will make .
It is in the interests of the democratic credibility of the Iraqi Government , as well as the US Administration , which has granted their status as protected persons , to protect their lives , respect their free will and dignity and guarantee their safe future under international law .
In view of the time I am afraid I will not take the further supplementary question .
Of course we must also correct what can be corrected , but we should have , on this issue , a confident and positive attitude and a belief that we are on the right road in line with our humanist traditions .
( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the result of the Irish referendum was clear and was an excellent signal both for Europe and for Ireland .
in writing . - The Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North - East Atlantic fisheries , to which the EU is a contracting party , was approved by Council Decision 81/608 / EEC and entered into force on 17 March 1982 .

In a context of increasing mobility and migration , it is essential for people to master the national language or languages if they are to become fully integrated into society .
Mr Barroso , I fully and completely accept that you expressed your opinion , and the report .
The package submitted by President Barroso to the Parliament is a step forward and it is encouraging that the Council recognizes that the EU must agree on a range of policies before the end of 2008 .
Now , at second reading , the other side of the coin must be addressed , namely agreement on the inter - institutional debate on Parliament 's right to democratic scrutiny .
It is therefore the occasion for our Parliament to stress the benefits consequent to a genuinely completed single market .
Furthermore , the Croatian Government urgently has to address the structural weaknesses of the economy and devote greater attention to regional cooperation , in order to tackle bilateral issues with neighbouring countries .
They demand not only that the regulation be rescinded , but also that a special independent commission be appointed under the auspices of the European Parliament to investigate and explain the principles and method of counting fish numbers in the Baltic Sea following enlargement of the Union in 2004 , and to grasp the extent of the irregularities .
The most recent expression of this offensive is the unlawful intervention in Portugal by the ' troika ' of the International Monetary Fund , the European Commission and the European Central Bank .
The introduction of fingerprints and photographs will ensure that the new visas cannot be forged or misused .
This is the least we can do .
( DE ) Madam President , I 'm delighted to be given the opportunity of taking the floor in the first meeting to be chaired by you .
We cannot take responsibility for the development of Kosovo .
We have therefore chosen to vote against this report on the Commission 's budget for 2010 .
The car industry is another growing problem .
President of the Commission . - Frankly speaking , I do not believe that there is now openness among all Member States to consider Eurobonds for this kind of expenditure .
15-20 % of European young people have suffered harassment on the Internet .
I would also like to say that it is the major issues that are always on our table .
Producer organisations account today for 40 % of the total output of fruit and vegetables .
Allow me to single out a couple of further examples .
We waited to submit our final result .
Secondly , the main goal of the common agricultural policy must continue to be to maintain market stability and food security .
Of course , in the case of reserves , probably to be voted , I have to reiterate the position of the Commission and we are , of course , striving to respond to the conditions set by Parliament as early as possible .
We expect that progress to start now .
Today is no ordinary day for the European Parliament : it is a day when we call to mind a fundamental concern of the European Union : the work towards peace , progress and human rights exemplified by the Sakharov Prize laureates .
We are aware that all food hygiene legislation is a sensitive matter and therefore very time - consuming .
Mr President , giving money from one 's own pockets is an act of generosity .
So , in my opinion , the recovery plan and the third energy package is something that needs to be done .
It is also regrettable , for example , that , if crucial information is not provided , a contract will still exist one year on .
There is an old Jewish joke which says that , if you have two options , always choose the third .
Cohesion policy needs to be increasingly participative and civil society needs to play a greater role in designing and managing the projects .
Nor is it a coincidence that the Member States took an almost unanimously dismissive stand on this dossier in the Council .
Some projects have simply been pushed back so that , in the foreseeable future , we then have the prospect of only the most immediate major expenditure .
The report rightly stresses that temporary measures are insufficient and that any attempt to create a system outside the EU 's institutional framework is a threat to the Union project ; for this reason , it also rightly calls for a more significant role for the European Commission .
However , when I consider our agricultural production and the products themselves , not everything can be proven scientifically .
Nevertheless , there must be early destruction of data belonging to innocent members of those targeted groups .
We have to work together to fight tax fraud and dubious tax havens .
This approach is malicious and counter - productive .
Sweden , Austria and Finland took that route , while countries such as Switzerland , Iceland and Norway followed a different path .
I am certain his result will be even better .
For example , it will lead to serious market distortions within the EU and impose unwarranted burdens on consumers .
We all have a responsibility to sustain this fishery , and indeed all fisheries , but I referred to this one in particular .
I agree with the report 's thesis according to which the most important thing is student mobility , with the creation of a system of incentives and facilitations , so that young people may take advantage of offers to study wherever they like .
The other States , too , are starting to articulate their claims more strongly .
For that reason , traditional fishing methods should be encouraged ; these provide thousands of people with a livelihood and are much more selective .
There are several significant aspects of the adopted report that are positive : first , the need to regulate imports and ensure that all animals and meat imported from third countries meet the same welfare requirements as are applied in the EU ; second , the need to adequately cover the additional costs resulting from animal welfare promotion ; third , recognition of the limited investment capacity of many small and medium - sized producers , damaged by the unfair way in which the food supply chain works ; and , lastly , the proposal for incentives for the regional breeding , marketing and slaughter of animals in order to obviate the need for animals to be transported over long distances for rearing or slaughter .
Another decisive point in my opinion is that we still need something on the question of out - of - court settlements .
I would like to point out that for 2010 , a fishing quota of 3 500 tonnes has been decided .
On 15 February , Iran was subjected to a universal periodic review , which reviews the situation regarding the protection and promotion of human rights in the country .
This applies equally to our Member States and the democracy in Turkey .
The Csangos , who also live in dire circumstances in one particular area ?
I therefore urge the Commission in the long term to come forward with plans to ensure that there will be some sort of stability mechanism for the benefit not only of producers but also , of course , of consumers in the long term .
So I do not want to go further because we will have a number of occasions to be in contact with Parliament .
Therefore , I encourage support for Mr Stockmann 's report once again .
I stand here fortunate , as a gay man - and if I chose to be gay , is it not interesting that one obviously therefore chooses to be heterosexual ? - fighting for equality , not just for gay men and lesbians and bisexuals and transgender people , but for people on the basis of their age , their religion , their belief , their gender , anything that is perceived to be different that could be used to take equality away from them .
I also believe it important to further integrate the outermost regions into the European Research Area as well as promoting cooperation with neighbouring regions .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Barrot , and all of you attending here today , the European Parliament firmly supports the abolition of the visa regime for all the countries of the Western Balkans .
That should be taken into account .
Yet it is also clear , Mr President , that , under your presidency , our Parliament has continued its gradual transformation from an institution that demands and fights for democracy to an assembly that is all too often submissive and careful not to rock the boat of this or that government .
In 2006 the European Union made its position on the provision of public services clear and did not even subject the sensitive area of public services to open competition .
Homeowners and tenants will be well - informed , with specific details of the energy consumption and potential energy savings of a building .
We must be aware - and this really is a crime - that these people are being exploited even in a progressive confederation of states such as Europe .
I thank Mr Saryusz - Wolski for having addressed this matter .
One year later , we are getting new rules , new instruments and more ambitious policies .
Here I would like to point out that rightly or wrongly , for example in my country in the past , mass grubbing - up operations were carried out , for which , however , no financial assistance measures are now included at European level .
The European right - wing is getting ready simply to abolish the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy .
If anybody today said that the victims of the Holocaust deserve less attention than the gas chambers , they would put their credibility in question .
I must say that this visit takes place under favourable circumstances .
As my fellow Member from Lithuania pointed out just now , barely 8 % of Lithuanians who went abroad to work used the instruments offered by EURES .
I supported the resolution because , despite the economic and financial downturn and the instability in North African countries , European institutions should not and cannot fail to support Japan both economically and in terms of humanitarian aid .
I urge and await an official position from Mr Buzek .
I should like to emphasise that European citizens want Parliament to perform its duties impeccably and , in order to safeguard this , it is important for its members , its committees and its political groups to have the necessary resources .
I understand them , but I am nevertheless encouraging them to commit themselves fully to a cooperation process with their ACP neighbours , so as to enable complementary and supportive relationships to be built around common aims .
I voted in favour of the resolution on the transparency and current position of the Anti - Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) negotiations because I support a transparent process in the conduct of negotiations .
Mr President , I want to congratulate my colleague Mr Hutchinson on the excellent report he has written on a very important subject .
Since the new Commission has not yet taken office , we should ask the President of the Commission to attend such a discussion himself or to send somebody who will have a post in the new Commission , such as Mr Almunia or Mr Rehn .
The Russian Government should do everything in its power to prove that it did not order the terrorist assassination of a British citizen - which also means a European citizen - Alexander Litvinenko .
It opens a single door to 27 labour markets .
Space policy and the GNSS programme are of strategic importance and should provide tangible benefits for citizens and businesses .
For this reason , I voted in favour of the regulation .
I would like to wish Mr Ortuondo luck with an excellent report and look forward to the Commission implementing the action plan .
Furthermore , the EU 's common agricultural policy will have to be adapted to a new economic and social climate at local and regional level , which will take into account the increase in energy costs .
Indeed , the United States , which we vilify for not ratifying Kyoto , is actually doing better than the EU in terms of emissions trend .
( Applause )
I now wonder , given that these agencies are not yet operational , whether it might not be worth considering whether to have one single European Agency working through 25 offshoots in the different countries .
Ensuring the freedom of the press , on the other hand , actually is a matter that should be dealt with at EU level .
It should include action which will guarantee peaceful coexistence in the future .
Even if you look at America there is tax competition within the states and it appears to be working extremely well there .
Baroness Ashton has our full support .
Moreover , I must mention that in its statement of 9 February 2010 , the Council promised to negotiate an interinstitutional agreement with Parliament on this topic .
A reduction in the VAT rates for locally supplied and labour - intensive services should have a positive impact , since it will reduce the level of undeclared labour , whilst also reducing its appeal and increasing demand within the formal economy .
However - and here we are in accord - this progress is not enough .
That is a sign , in my view , of strength and not of weakness .
This evening , I will suggest that my group votes against this agreement .
The fundamental preconditions for achieving the overall objectives of cohesion policy are sound financial discipline and transparency in the allocation of funds .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mrs Napoletano , first allow me to congratulate you on the work done , since it has allowed a report to be produced that is genuinely important on several levels .
That proves that it was at least possible to perfect the Barcelona Process and we will all focus our efforts in that direction .
One possible measure would also be to extend the Erasmus programme , currently intended for students , to other socio - professional groups as well , such as young people without university qualifications or unemployed people included in professional retraining programmes .
I support Mr Cercas 's report which protects employee interests without ignoring the legitimate interests of employers , offering them the opportunity to adapt working hours to their needs .
The Agency should have adequate powers to achieve its tasks and I was able to support the report which ensures these powers whilst guaranteeing the independence of national regulators .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( LT ) We are considering a very important document , which should help reform the European Statistical System .
Nobody says that , in deciding to send our soldiers to war for profit , Tony Blair also put his country in danger [ . . . ]
That would be more intelligent , healthier , safer and greener .
We need one another , and I hope things will develop in a direction where , one day , gender no longer plays such a big role as skills and expertise .
I think that the EU 's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights is a step towards extending human freedom and the freedom of the individual .
Therefore , the heading for this legislative procedure which we have brought to an initial agreement should not read Sarkozy but Sacconi .
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes
The call from the European Parliament and request submitted to the European Commission to come up with a specific proposal to set up a Civil Protection Force which can respond quickly in the event of a natural disaster anywhere in the world must be answered .
Does the Commission have information concerning cross - border trading in shares and investment services ?
The events of August and September have proved that there is no need to travel here and that the Parliament building in Brussels is more than capable of coping with our official sittings , and that EU citizens would be far happier if we discontinued this monthly commute .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
President - in - Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Mr President , honourable Member , the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora , or CITES , provides the international legal framework for the conservation of tigers and other endangered species .
It will carefully examine the latest ruling of the Supreme Court and will monitor subsequent measures adopted by the Greek authorities .
Member of the Commission . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall be very brief .
in writing . - ( PT ) I agree on the whole with this motion for a resolution , which concerns the Anti - Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) , approved after long months of debate and efforts to find a compromise solution between the various political groups , which was unfortunately not achieved .
I want to emphasise the fact that practices of this kind are already banned under the terms of Directive 2006/114 / EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and of anti - fraud legislation in the various Member States .
Only they first have to obtain a piece of paper giving them permission for that .
The next item is the report by Mr Christensen , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on common principles of flexicurity .
On the question of who should collect the charges , my view is that subsidiarity is still the best way because , after all , it is not Member States , but citizens , that pay .
However , if the translation costs are deemed to be insupportable in future , the minimum must be that the verbatim report contains the speaker 's original language and an English translation .
In this sense , it is necessary for the MFF 's values to match the ambition and commitment that the Europe 2020 strategy constitutes .
I believe that this directive constitutes a positive step towards bringing clarity and legal certainty both for taxable persons and for the administrations , whilst providing additional means to fight against value added tax fraud .
Based on these financing instruments and within the budget outlook for 2014-2020 , the Commission must also identify a financing solution for exploiting gas from alternative sources , which could have a far - reaching impact on the European gas and energy market .
My group would like to repeat that the failure to include the European Parliament , the civil society organisations that have so far been affected , or even the national parliaments , gives rise to serious questions .
It is a dangerous measure , and it is scandalous that it has been integrated into a report aimed at taking into account the strategic importance of agriculture .
We need to send a clear message to them .
- ( NL ) Whilst the resolution on Guantánamo contains a number of elements that confirm the very foundations of the rule of law , I am not happy , of course , with the underlying tenor of this text , namely that the detainees of Guantánamo would be victims of some sort that deserve our sympathy .
Measures to consider include : freezing of financial assets , ban on transactions , investment restrictions ; trade restrictions on particular goods ; travel restrictions ; diplomatic constraints and cultural and sports restrictions .
The consequence of climate change for the Arctic will be another important element of our discussions at the summit .
In recent months the Presidency , together with the Commission , has invested a lot of effort at the highest level in trying to overcome the remaining obstacles on the EU side .
I have a suggestion to make : this resolution is a rigorous one and it needs to be , but there is no need to kill the sinner .

Another example is the support for tobacco production being put in place at the same time as measures to reduce tobacco consumption .
Yes , he is very happy to go !
author , on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) I wish to propose a stylistic amendment .
I would stress that we can only do what we can .
That is why - and I will conclude on this very practical point - it is very important that many Members participate in the hearing that the Commission will organise with experts at the beginning of October and in the conference that the French Presidency of the European Union will hold in Paris on 23 and 24 October .
The work of the European Union is sometimes seen as rather technical : interesting to specialists , but not relevant to people 's daily lives .
A financial activities tax appears the best way to deal with the issue in the EU .
It is a matter of detail that needs to be clarified .
The success of this policy also depends on the Member States , who must use financial measures such as reducing VAT , allocating the maximum authorised proportion of European funds to energy performance , and so on .
Therefore , I ask everyone to vote responsibly , and to consider a moderate , but definite price increase above the minimum level .
Secondly , when the margins diminish at the end of the budget period and , at the same time , new tasks are added , the need for flexibility will also increase .
Unfortunately , woefully few Member States have invested 3 % of their GDP in research .
Some extremely important remarks and comments were made with respect , for example , to whether the accession negotiations have been too long or not .
( The oral amendment was accepted )
In the interests of retaining the EU 's competitive advantage , the launch must not be delayed , otherwise other countries such as China , India and Japan will outstrip us .
Thirdly , I would like to remind you that this is only the first step .
Training plastics engineers now to be unemployed in three years time , to then train a type of financial manager who will be unemployed after four years ; I want to ask the European countries of Portugal and Estonia a question .
There is a line called ' approximation of standards ' that can be used to call on rural development funding for these extra costs that will certainly be felt by many of the smaller sheep producers .
You and all the Members of this Parliament have been directly elected by our citizens and the Commission has the right and the duty to put European interests above any particular interest .
If we do not stop this conflict , it will bring hatred to Europe 's own streets .
I compliment the Commission on its undertaking to prevent disorder by facilitating dialogue with Member States , international organisations , sports bodies and police forces .
For this reason , the Commission considers that , as part of its working programme for 2009 , it will revise and rewrite the legislation relating to people trafficking , exploitation and sexual abuse of children , which is a terrible crime committed mainly against girls .
- Before the vote on Amendment 3 :
Mr President , competition policy is a cornerstone of European legislation .
We know that the EU cannot achieve this alone , as the national governments need to agree to it .
We have no right to be in Africa , none whatsoever , whether moral or otherwise .
A situation in which a media magnate at one and the same time both heads the state security service and is a member of the High Judicial Council , which has the power to appoint and dismiss judges , is not characteristic of a democratic state .
Some 98 % of the victims of cluster bombs are civilians .
It is time we finally worked together on a real internal market for rail transport and thus invested in a green and sustainable future .
Legislative intervention is desired in this area .
I believe that something similar happened to the Barcelona Process : it was not finished , but it was abandoned - in part at least .
However , that does not stop us from offering development assistance or humanitarian aid , even when we do not agree with the government or the regime in place .
As Members will be aware , initially , catch restrictions were imposed on vessels flying the Polish flag .
For this task , we have Frontex and Eurosur , instruments that bring added value to the work of the Member States and reflect the necessary European spirit of cooperation and solidarity .
Even before the German and Belgian colonisation , the Hutus were in the majority in Burundi and Rwanda and the Tutsis were in the minority .
As Mr Surján said , the available budget is tight - 1 % of gross national product .
It also warns of the speculation on foodstuffs that has been taking place , but limits itself to calling for excessive speculation to be fought and therefore believes that speculation on foodstuffs can continue , provided that it is not excessive .
With its proposal , the Commission proposes to extend by 5 years the current requirement for EU countries to have a minimum standard VAT rate of 15 % .
However , it is relatively ineffective .
Products that are made in a less clean way outside the EU gain a competitive edge in global markets .
( RO ) Thank you for the specifications , but I would have liked to have had some additional information .
Thus , the ACTA agreement will leave the existing legal situation in Europe almost unchanged .
I am specifically concerned about developing the necessary infrastructure where it does not exist .
I also believe that every European citizen must participate in the battle against climate change , and comprehensive energy - saving campaigns are required to achieve this .
It is an important step forward for the entire European Union , but especially for Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states , that banks cannot abandon their subsidiaries situated in that region but must forward the support they receive .
I rather doubt it .
What if the Commission was to think about adopting different approaches ?
The allocation of additional , generous funds in order to build a stable EU neighbourhood seems unavoidable .
This is entirely a question of strategy for our European Union , again at a time when currency wars seem on the verge of breaking out .
I can mention here the Eastern Partnership and Black Sea Synergy .
More nationalism invariably means more wars .
This agreement , although not enough , is a step in the right direction .
EU priorities for the 63rd Session of the UN General Assembly (
On behalf of the Commission , I would once again like to thank Parliament for its crucial cooperation and its contribution to this report , and I hope , like Mr Reynders , that we will be able to reach an agreement which is as broad as possible on this compromise , which , in our view , remains a dynamic compromise , and which enables us to maintain one of the commitments made at the G 20 : to learn the lessons of the financial crisis .
I made the original amendment in part with the report on Equitable Life in mind , but in the context of the financial crisis it has a wider resonance and I have achieved similar inclusions in the capital requirements and credit - rating proposals .
Seeking the support of a majority of Member States must not be done at the expense of our ultimate goal .
I am particularly pleased that the concept of mixed zones is retained .
This is now changing .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - Mr President , my group , the GUE / NGL Group , considers that the ' made in ' origin marking of products which come from outside the EU is an urgent necessity for the European Union .
The Parliament celebrates Europe Day on 9 May .
However , I would like to ask the Member States not to attempt to go it alone and I would like to put particular emphasis on this .
Only through such a project - based approach , focused on small - scale specific projects , can we overcome the issue of the very diverse and complex interests in the region .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
Independence : it has to be clear who provides and who finances the information so that consumers can identify potential conflicts of interest ;
There are three points that need to be made clear in the resolution on the intelligent car .
The Group of the Greens therefore calls upon you to put this subject on the agenda for the United States / European Union Summit in early November .
We keep saying we want a system that is independent of the USA , but now Boeing is clearly interested in this tender , so that does not seem quite true any more either .
This work is now on the table .
I must also ask you to continue working for passenger information and passenger rights .
The Commission , together with the EU Member States , is working on an environmental integration strategy to ensure that development cooperation efforts contribute to these objectives .
I think that ECB decisions are generally transparent , based on a good flow of information and open objectives .
According to the case - law of the Court of Justice on this matter , the Member States should maintain their autonomy and legitimacy in regulating the activity of providers of online gambling and gambling games .
The European project is about integration and not about creating enclaves based on ethnic criteria .
In 1989 , when my country finally defeated the communist dictatorship , Liu Xiaobo was protesting in Tiananmen Square , demanding exactly the democratic freedoms which were shortly to be enjoyed by almost the whole of Europe .
If we have a common fisheries policy , it should be common for all , no exceptions , no exemptions , and the long - term consequences of this are quite serious .
The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday 22 May 2008 have been distributed .
( NL ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the Ranner report on the grounds that it offers a good solution to the problem of driving times and rest periods in road transport .
The EU and this Parliament need to examine honestly how it approaches such matters in the future .
What role will the Commission have in its management and in defining the conditions for its application ?
Ladies and gentlemen , in the context of a partnership , is it normal practice for one of the partners to resort to such action ?
Consequently , Parliament will continue to take its duty to review the performance of the ECB very seriously .
The only politician who knew how to deal with Gaddafi was Ronald Reagan .
Serbs , Croats and Bosnians will have to find their own way .
However , I am firmly opposed to having harmonised soil protection legislation imposed upon all of us , funded by the Community , simply because there is no soil protection legislation in some countries .
21 .
Everyone knows that Britain is worse off than any other country as we go into these hard times .
We can use a carrot and stick policy , but there must be more carrot .
My question to the Commission is therefore : in view of the circumstances and bearing in mind that an integrated approach to this issue is needed - in other words , anti - climate change policy cannot be dissociated from civil protection policy - does the Commission not think that in these circumstances a directive on fires is justified ?
For me , the choice is simple .
You have to listen to this statement .
That has nothing to do with Ireland .
It is important to remember that when we vote on the Directive on consumer rights in Parliament tomorrow - a directive that we have now been working on for many years .
This is probably correct , because the Member States are not in a position to come up with accurate calculations .
Therefore , they should be used sparingly and prudently , but there are occasions when they must be used decisively .
But the cohesion policy has the capacity to mobilise regional or local actors across all boundaries in pursuit of European objectives .
There seems to be a lot of confusion arising from the criteria for defining less favourable regions .
However , sometimes , arrangements between schemes in different Member States have not worked in practice , and we support the EFDI 's efforts to achieve a voluntary model agreement .
Who have we made these interim agreements with ?
We may make some small steps forward .
The greatest volume of public procurement from EU funds relates to buildings , where there is often a suspicion - and sometimes more than that - of corruption .
In light of the compromise amendments reached , and given the positive changes made to the substance of the text over recent months , we have decided to withdraw our proposal to reject the texts .
As the agreement supplements , rather than replacing , the existing agreements between several Member States and Brazil , which cover travel for purposes other than tourism and business or paid activity , there is no reason why it should not be concluded .
First , it aggravates the factors contributing to the organisation 's failures , and there are quite a few of these .
Quite frankly , I do not know how to vote in favour or against or abstain .
According to estimates , total VAT fraud Europe - wide amounts to EUR 80-100 billion .
However , the question I wish to ask - and I shall conclude now , Mr President - is whether the EU Member States are willing to increase resources to meet the growing needs that are emerging in those countries .
Madam President , Mrs Lynne , this is a good stocktake of the lack of social security under which far too many of the citizens in the Member States are forced to live .
The decisions that we are to take with regard to the future cannot wait until we have the new Multiannual Financial Framework in place ; we really need to get started on this future - oriented work now , and in this regard 2012 and 2013 will be absolutely crucial .
Those states have still not shown that they are capable of countering the lack of coordination and the loss of attractiveness for investment and innovation .
We already have excellent police cooperation in Europe and we do not need CEPOL here .
Then secondly , on Frontex , Minister Wallström , what do you actually mean when you talk about strengthening Frontex ?
in writing . - ( DE ) A pluralist media system is a fundamental prerequisite for the survival of the European model of a democratic society .
Mr President , I opposed the joint motion for a resolution on forest fires , despite the fact that I agree with European countries cooperating voluntarily to prevent , fight and repair the appalling damage caused by forest fires .
However , the Council 's conclusions have failed to emphasise this priority .
I think that , if you say that there is an absolute ban on asbestos in Europe , you have to be consistent with that and allow no exemptions .
We now have a significantly enhanced international framework , in particular , thanks to the adoption , in 2009 , of resolutions 1888 and 1889 .
I believe that we must ensure that battery farming is completely banned by 1 January 2012 .
That is what our citizens are expecting from us .
If we want to come through this crisis with a Union that is intact , undamaged and reinvigorated then we must respect our own rules .
They have done a very competent and responsible job and , in so doing , have also been able to keep the budget down at a lower level than I had thought possible at the outset .
Why are there so many different examples , which , despite this ' simplification ' , are not meeting with enthusiastic applause ?
Instead of calling a spade a spade , the report only ' stresses the importance of ... ' , after the rejection of any concrete figures , benchmarks and deadlines .
Turkey 's membership is something which is much further away , and certainly will not happen within the next 10 years .
( NL ) Madam President , I have voted in favour of this surprisingly excellent report on FRONTEX , because I can only applaud the appeal made in it for reinforcement of that institution .
The impact of a resolution adopted afterwards will be much weaker .
Everyone can benefit from it .
The African Union is not taking effective measures to improve the situation in Zimbabwe .
I would particularly like to thank Mr Őry for this .
It provides enough time for them to join our system or to set up an equivalent system .
The specific economic and spatial problems of mountainous regions require supra - national legal regulations to be put in place governing the objectives and principles of pursuing specific mountain policy in Member States and , more importantly , they require that a suitable level of financing be ensured for projects and programmes for those regions in particular .
The steady rise in basic food prices is an acute problem which cannot be ignored .
To be specific , it clarifies the roles of the EU in international credit institutions , in the UN system , in multilateral security organisations and in other multilateral organisations in general , such as the World Trade Organisation , the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development .
I am therefore counting on the Member States to launch cooperation initiatives in key areas such as e-health and health technology assessments .
No one is benefiting from the impasse that has been reached in the negotiations with the Council , and despite the crisis that Europe is undergoing , it is necessary to come to an understanding so that the EU can meet the objectives outlined in the EU 2020 strategy .
There is a huge amount of work ahead of us , and the expectations of our citizens are high ; it is a time for action and delivery .
This is the third report .
The state of our industry is robust , and our flagship , the euro , has indeed steered us through the straits .
I can understand that many politicians prefer to see European fishermen on the west coast of Africa rather than in the streets of Brussels .
The thinly disguised aim is the monitoring of all remarks under threat of penalty , whether they are made in writing or spoken at meetings .
Nevertheless , during the transitional period , non - EU entities will be able to apply national investment rules , whereas EU funds and managers will be subject to the directive , which tends to be stricter .
In this context , this is a case of adopting a regulation that aims to establish harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products . That is , it establishes the rules that the Member States must observe in order for their products to come onto the market in the European Union .
in writing . - I strongly believe the Commission was right to propose amendment of Regulation ( EC ) No 1080/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund as regards the eligibility of housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities .
What we need is confidence in the purely commercial nature of their objectives , which means that transparency and corporate governance are the key factors .
( The President cut off the speaker . )
Quite the opposite : it asks that we ' avoid creating barriers to the natural course of rivers ' , and indulges in scaremongering about social and environmental problems caused by rivers being diverted .
It was one of the first European institutions and its aim was to establish an international system for free navigation on the Danube .
E-commerce is an excellent commercial opportunity for small and medium - sized enterprises and for young entrepreneurs .
15 .
And I must say that with only weeks to go until the Copenhagen meeting , it is not responsible to act in such a way that we shall not have a leadership in place for the Commission .
So it is important that what we do should also have the backing of neighbouring countries and of the Zimbabwean people themselves .
I stand by this issue . I want to see special tariffs for vulnerable customers .
This morning , many Members took part in the discussion and I believe that on this occasion , there were many more Members involved than usual .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
For the 2011 budget , additional expenditure is required above and beyond the ceilings of headings 1a and 4 .
But as you yourself have said : travailler plus pour gagner plus .
It is difficult to explain to the European public why , for example , the Prince of Monaco or large multinationals such as Heineken and Nestlé receive hundreds of thousands of euros in income support in the form of agricultural subsidies merely because they own some land , whilst real farmers often struggle to make ends meet .
2007 discharge : FRONTEX (
in writing . - The Cohesion Policy and rural development measures come under the same principle of solidarity promoted by the European project and contribute to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
I welcome improved coordination of economic and fiscal policy in Europe , but strongly oppose the short - term vision under which this is being imposed .
In the opinion of the liberals and democrats , Turkey must reform its economy and society , politics and constitution irrespective of its accession prospects , in its own interest , in the interests of its people .
We must not therefore be too hasty to legislate and we must take time to consider the laws and adopt a more responsible approach .
If we reopen this debate - a Pandora 's box - I can guarantee that there would be no agreement at the end of this year .
In my view , the fact that the heads of state of the Member States have not yet resolved to take a common approach can be considered at best misguided , at worst a failure .
While the European Parliament is discussing how children can be better protected , the Islamic world is moving in the opposite direction .
The two non - negotiable conditions set by the Commission were fully respected .
The broad subjective and objective scope of the regulation is justified by the frighteningly low rate of obtention of maintenance payments in certain EU Member States .
Therefore , I would kindly ask the Commissioner to seriously consider this matter and come up with a viable solution as soon as possible .
Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy . - ( HU ) Thank you for the floor , Madam President .
That is really sad , Mr President , but it is we who are then going to be subject to accusations of being populist .
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 103(2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
Vice - President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Madam President , I want to begin by honouring the memory of Richard Holbrooke , a dedicated diplomat , a champion of peace and a man I was proud to call my friend .
Unfortunately , I cannot give you an answer , because I can no longer remember myself what the group chair said at midday today .
on behalf of the PPE - DE Group . - Mr President , we are here today to prevent a potential , large - scale , human tragedy from taking place .
This is where fierce opposition is frequently met from politicians , institutions and public opinion .
This Europe really is the Europe of nation states .
Consequently , the agreement has been suspended , and no data is being transferred .
12 .
I especially hope that our energies can then be better used for and directed at the Europe of results , of which the Commission President spoke and has always spoken .
He , as a person with a disability , working from home , would be ideal to start up a new business .
We can inspire Member States to make more intelligent use of the funds and to coordinate this with UNHCR .
Vice - President of the Commission . - Mr President , the comitology reform that was decided in July 2006 introduced a ' regulatory procedure with scrutiny ' , which gives a veto right to the European Parliament on measures of general scope that amend a basic legal act adopted under codecision .
Here again , life is not considered at its true value , but as a mere utilitarian function .
As regards the specific situation of older people , ethnic minorities and persons with disabilities , the Council has already adopted legislation aiming to protect these and other vulnerable groups from discrimination .
I voted for discharge in respect of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2006 and the report by Mr Jørgensen , which recommends granting discharge to the Commission .
I was also pleased by the very frequent references to the new beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy .
( For the results and other details of the vote : see Minutes )
However , this is not to say that the improvements made have had no effect on the current directive , and , in fact , it is to be welcomed that no upfront payments have to be made until the end of the cooling - off period .
Russia is not an ally of Europe with whom we share values ; it is a neighbour with whom we share a geographical area , divergences and common interests , such as the situation in Afghanistan .
We are given a mandate by those citizens to respect and to make others respect the fundamental Treaties of the European Union , which protect the rights of their citizens .
Moreover the possibility is of course envisaged of changing supplier at any time and also of being promptly and regularly informed of prices set by suppliers .
Do with it what you will .
Some of the other languages contain mistakes , so please follow the German text .
However , it is equally important to ensure that these financial resources are being correctly deployed , in other words that they are having the desired effect .
Therefore , I would rather listen to the professionals - like the farmer , the keeper of 30 000 happy EU - compliant hens , that I visited in my constituency last month .
Accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Convention on driving disqualifications ( vote )
Also foreseen is an ' impact assessment ' in 2008 , to precede the action plan for 2009-2012 , on the basis of a clear timetable .
I was not in favour of basing this joint project in Europe as the host pays a disproportionate part of the total budget .
The second issue specific to Romania is the continuation , obviously on a much smaller scale , of transhumance , a practice which should be treated , in my view , as a separate issue in itself and preserved as far as possible .
The aim of the measures is to revamp the rail sector by removing hindrances to the operation of trains on the European rail network .
This is not a good Directive .
This factor is particularly worrying as the EU is at present preparing to launch the Eastern Partnership .
A public consultation on an issues paper was launched on 16 November and will close in early January .
To avoid the disaster of asymmetrical adjustments , we urgently need dialogue and collective action .
We will review the text to take into account legitimate concerns .
That covers all the points relevant to the internal market .
That is also why the Commission welcomes the European Space Agency 's intention to develop an instrument to that end , called space situational awareness , that can not only verify the observance of the relevant agreements but also monitor the security of our satellites .
However , by the same token , I do not think it is appropriate for us to use such cases , which we are not always very familiar with , as a pretext for internal political struggle .
Compared with other places , there is no right to health that can be exercised to the same extent in Bulgaria or Romania , so it is evident that this resolution , with all its complications , can be a useful point of reference .
Minimum standards for the protection of calves ( codified version ) ( vote )
The interim agreements will be replaced with full EPAs that include similar provisions before any substantive liberalisation commitments apply on the ACP side .
This involves the sustainable extraction of raw materials , sustainable transport , conditions for scientific research , the protection of nature and , last but not least , the rights of the indigenous inhabitants .
We will be open about this , but , at the same time , the Council is considering a possible relaxation of certain sanctions , particularly the visa restrictions imposed on some Belarus officials affected by the sanctions .
These are countries which joined the Union only recently and which are outside the euro area .
There is obviously always the possibility of there being complex difficulties in these relations , and there can also be disagreements , but the relationship between the European Union and Russia is a broad and multifaceted one .
We wish them success in their fight for religious tolerance , for which this country was and still is a shining example , and it is something that , as partners who can speak openly on matters to do with human rights , we must preserve in Egypt , Tunisia and Malaysia .
This is a crucial task , but the IMF 's role , beyond stabilising the markets , is also to help correct the global imbalances that caused this crisis .
We met again in Paris on 13 and 14 July .
I know that one of the major events in 2006 - if I am not mistaken - took place in Vienna , and the outcome of that conference was very inspiring for our work .
( DE ) Mr Vondra , it is always being said that agricultural policy is there for only the 3 % who farm , but there are 100 % of us who eat .
We need to do that in the future , but what I expect is direct budget aid given to Egypt as fast as possible , because by the end of the year , they will have no money in their budget and that could be the beginning of a counter - revolution in Egypt .
We also want the campaigns to be free and fair , and that all parties have an equal chance to have their say .
We note that Morocco is going to launch an investigation , but we resolutely believe and we demand that there should be an international inquiry to shed light on events .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to refer back to a passage of Commissioner De Gucht 's speech on international development cooperation .
Ironically , these fraudulent companies quote EU law in order to intimidate their targets further .
Conservation of fisheries resources through technical measures (
I would like to congratulate Mrs Járóka and also Mrs Kinga Göncz , and I welcome the commitment of the Council and the Commission .
It is of paramount importance , since this package really is the cornerstone of our comprehensive response to the crisis that is still ongoing .
We know that illegal immigration can decrease the GDP of several countries by up to 20 % , whilst their economic growth is limited by the reduction in the number of skilled workers .
His proposal increases legal certainty and removes unjustifiably stringent requirements in order to reduce companies ' administrative burdens by 25 % by 2012 .
Whichever Member State you look at , that represents the large majority of businesses .
That is the key to this strategy and it depends on us , on the Member States and on our common political will .
The aim of the programme is not , of course , to criminalise the Internet in a catastrophic vision of new technologies ; quite the contrary .
Such understanding of voluntary activity also means that the volunteer , who is often also a benefactor , must not suffer any material penalty when helping others and offering them gifts .
I can give another example .
Madam President , climate change can no longer be viewed rigidly in environmental terms , but must instead be mainstreamed as a cross - cutting concept through varying policy areas , including development and human rights .
Yesterday , there was a meeting of the Conference of Presidents , and also a meeting of the Bureau .
The message we wish to send to the Council is this : shoulder your responsibilities , present a united front ; what we need is not a gesture but a coherent long - term policy .
But it will formulate the principles ensuring equal treatment of SMEs , and bring in the initial framework of a policy aimed at enterprises .
They operate within the internal market and should be able to enjoy the measures to the same extent , and not just at national level .
The Winter Olympics in Sochi also have to re - examined ; there cannot be an Olympic truce .
Serbia 's full integration into the European Union is in the interest of European stability and security .
It would mean that there is a suspicion of fraud in this case , because I know that OLAF can only carry out investigations in the case of suspected fraud .
( FR ) Mr President , Minister , Madam Vice - President of the European Commission , my question concerns the application of the Treaty of Lisbon , especially the promise made to the Irish people to have one Commissioner per country .
Commissioner , I would like you to inform us of your position on this matter , either today or later on .
Of course this is one of the things that the Asylum Support Office will be looking at : how to pull together that information from a variety of sources in a more standard format and perhaps a format where people will have greater confidence that the information is not being used politically .
Something I would like to do during the European Football Championships - which are not long away now and which will be hosted in Poland and Ukraine - is to watch one or two matches with you .
So the measures in place so far are not adequate .
It is not enough for Europe to make statements and resolutions .
I am proud that , in Geneva , we see that Europe is a champion of human rights and , with the work due to start in June this year , our resolution today says that we should be a champion of further reform of the Human Rights Council itself .
But I shall use this opportunity to start at the personal level .
We need to involve more women in vocational training , the sciences and educational fields that have been until now considered as ' masculine ' .
My colleague , Mrs Lynne , with her sensitive approach to social issues , and all of us with our amendments , have been involved in all the OMC actions included in the national action plans .
It is more than natural that I say a word about Georgia .
I could give you a list of the products imported , but I have only one minute so I cannot do so on this occasion .
Let me now turn to a second point : the legal expenses , which are very important for the consumers and for insurers as well .
This is also in the interest of municipalities , which are often harmed by the negative impacts of transit traffic in particular .
Madam President , I voted against the resolution establishing a permanent crisis mechanism for the eurozone , because in Ireland and Greece , we see the reality that such mechanisms are to bail out a crisis - ridden financial system dominated by speculators and assorted profit - seeking sharks at the expense of working people , pensioners and the poor .
( The President cut off the speaker )
We must oppose the lobbyist and , at times , corrupt division of Europe , and must not condone Russia 's arrogance towards us , by which I mean the European Parliament .
Yes - countries have made improvements , and that is to be welcomed , but overall road deaths are still too high and the EU will not , on current trends , achieve its road death reduction targets .
It is right to have talked about it this morning and made our expectations known to the Member States .
However , one of the most important causes of death among mothers is hazardously performed abortions .
For this reason , I think we should take one step at a time .
Negotiations on the EU - Moldova Association Agreement (
When we in the Eurogroup agree that Member States that have achieved their medium - term financial target can now also act on the current economic downturn and rising oil and food prices , they can only do that because they have in the past worked out the budgetary margins that are necessary , so that they are not weakened and incapable of reacting in times of crisis .
A week ago , the largest mass grave in Latin America was discovered in Colombia .
They are , of course , to improve the quality of bodies of surface water .
It must remain a strong , well - financed policy , and one that is a genuine lever of economic development for all our regions .
This was a statement adopted by the European Council , not a conclusion .
Costly but sham security does no one any favours .
State of European asylum system , after the recent decision of the European Court of Human Rights ( debate )
I think it is absolutely despicable the way the President is behaving .
I wanted to say that right at the start before I come to my points of criticism .
1 .
However , all that remains fragile and at the mercy of the counterfeiting and technological advances of emerging countries , which are too often financed by the capital of European firms .
The European Commission was quick to react to the economic and financial crisis , and competition policy measures were adapted effectively .
However , services are a key source of growth and employment .
These positive trends have been quickly reversed , however , in a country where terror is spreading .
The UK has been politically taken over .
Without social progress , economic progress will run out of steam sooner or later .
A diplomacy of deeds and not just words .
Opening frontiers to third - country workers is necessary , but our top priority should be to lift the EU 's internal barriers first .
Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy , tell me this morning - because you have not done so yet - about the morality of transferring tens of billions of euro of private bad debts by speculators and bankers gambled wildly on the Irish property market and placing those debts on the shoulders of the Irish people who carry no responsibility whatsoever for them .
The retabling of the amendments ( Amendments 7 , 17 , 49 ) on hazardous substances is important for future health and safety and transparency .
It will be necessary to address issues which have surfaced recently , such as the subprime crisis and fuel and food prices , but when we do so we must bear in mind that the our circumstances are sounder , that next year we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the euro and that we must strengthen international economic cooperation .
For what we need is a broader plan of action , a better strategy which , apart from the sea itself , will include its drainage area , which currently , as we all know , is suffering severe flooding .
The European Union should indeed ensure thoroughly the respect of its high standards when importing goods from countries with lesser quality production standards like China .
Other countries have railways and possibly motorail trains , but our three Baltic States do not have this yet .
Some people argue that it is a resolution on regional policy rather than on fisheries .
Sweden is in a very exclusive club , almost alone at 1 % of GNI when it comes to development assistance .
This is a step in the right direction , provided that these instruments are implemented effectively .

Madam President , I wish to commend the rapporteur on his work .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to congratulate Mr Kirilov on the excellent work he has carried out in a field full of difficulties , but also opportunities , such as that of relations between EU countries and the countries of the South Caucasus .
Yet we react critically to the Council 's first proposal and assess it critically , and we are ready to discuss Kosovo and Palestine in the short term and also to discuss and take decisions on the proposals on the Galileo programme and the European Institute of Technology on around the 19th and will try to come to a mutual understanding on these important issues .
EU policy should hold the Russian authorities responsible for their collusion with criminal elements .
I firmly believe that Romania 's maritime border , for instance , is incomparably better protected than similar borders for other Schengen Member States .
On the other hand , there is insufficient support for economic initiatives and female entrepreneurship .
This INI report intends to set out the position of Parliament as regards the legislative package on economic policy coordination ( six proposals , including four under Codecision ) released by the Commission two weeks earlier .
The greatest benefit will be transparency , which will offer a great deal of help in giving the public a proper breakdown of the price of an air ticket . The citizens of the Union will have their trust in the EU reinforced and at the same time the principle of subsidiarity will not be compromised as a result .
The IASCF and the IASB have over recent years implemented significant reforms of their internal procedures but I cannot deny that further improvements are necessary .
I am speaking under Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure .
The EPAs cannot amount to mere free trade agreements under the auspices of the WTO , nor can they jeopardise the already fragile economies of our overseas communities .
Here is a case which is being handed to you on a plate .
The process of ratification of the Constitutional Treaty was wrecked due to unsuccessful referenda in France and the Netherlands .
The negative message at the Bucharest NATO summit , where the petty - minded and illogical behaviour of Greece played a major role , was unfortunate .
I have participated in other debates where there were perhaps one , two or three speakers and we share the time .
It also enabled productivity to be increased whilst retaining social harmony .
I would like to thank Mr Bösch , not only for his praise of our rapporteur , but also for his fairness and help .

On 1 October 2008 , only 1.7 % of transactions were made by way of the SEPA Credit Transfer format .
I am thinking for example of the fisheries policy , which has to cope with the consequences of the increase in diesel prices .
When I say ' actual ' , this means that it will eventually be necessary , one day , to raise the issue of derogations and emissions trading .
Her murderers have still not been brought to justice .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , I thank the Commissioner and Mr Vondra , for the Council , for their explanation , but I am certain they felt that there is still some hesitation on our part in giving them our full support .
The points of view of all concerned , and of course the proposals from the European institutions , will provide valuable input into the forthcoming action plan on urban mobility , which I intend to present this coming autumn .
This is the theorem that should appear on the frontispiece of the ' governance ' package .
In my opinion , it means two things : firstly , that we must reconsider the ' three times twenty ' objectives ; and secondly , that we must reconsider the timetable , that is to say , the end of the year .
In addition , the law grants custody of children only to the father and grandfather .
In other words , there is still a real need for economic change , and the partnership agreements can and must be used for that purpose .
It is an open secret that the data presented at the time by the European Commission regarding the effects of such a change came from the advertising materials of the producers of these new - technology light bulbs , and there is a great deal of evidence to indicate that this was the case .
Unilateral ambition is not ambition : only when we act together according to the same rules will it be easy to tighten our belts substantially .
We are quite convinced that there will also be some convictions , but in some national judiciaries it takes a very long time .
On that basis , the Commission will examine the situation carefully and will report on this in the visa reciprocity report that will be issued , probably , in September 2009 .

On ' Legislative procedure and planning : mutual cooperation ' it includes improving the involvement of Parliament , the review of all pending proposals at the beginning of a new Commission 's term of office , taking due account of the views of the Parliament , and the commitment by the Commission to report on the concrete follow - up to any legislative initiative requests pursuant to Article 225 TFEU .
On this subject , let us be quite clear : this was an infamous battle , and I am quite sure that everyone has reason to be dissatisfied .
Multi - country responses can be very effective but can result in divergence rather than the cohesion which we wish for under the European idea .
This is a commonly held and broad - based concern .
Things have taken place in this period of time - probably not fundamental enough to change the content of the strategy - but they complement the issues from this period .
Frankly , I was elected by this Parliament , by secret vote , so I think I deserve the respect of this Parliament , from all Members of the Parliament .
The Committee on Agriculture proposed that the Committee on Budgets revise the estimated expenditure , which it did .
The most important element in the report , in my view , is the clear commitment to Europe 's citizens that we will leave quotas - in other words , the task of determining how many people enter the labour market - up to the Member States , just as before .
What can the EU do ?
It is no coincidence that 95 % of European citizens believe in the importance of protecting our environment .
I also want to use this opportunity to call on the United States not to sign , at present , the treaties on the installation of their anti - missile shield elements in Europe .
We need to pay our monetary debt and that also means investing in these countries , both in order to adapt them and to combat climate change and to pay off our debt that has accumulated from our unfair common agricultural policy .
The adoption of Mr Zahradil 's proposal has reopened the debate on the importance of origin marking for products from third countries , as a measure designed to implement a trade policy that can prevent market disturbances due to a rise in foreign imports , and to sort out the complicated legislative environment that today makes it difficult for small and medium - sized enterprises to develop .
- Mr President , just a week before the European Council , we asked the Council , here in the European Parliament , to agree on clear guidelines and concrete measures towards safeguarding employment and creating new job opportunities .
No contract , no agreement , no society can be sustainable without justice .
in writing . - ( IT ) I am voting for this measure .
They should be regarded as a specifically vulnerable group , an exposure group in their own right , and a small step has been taken today in order to do that , in the vote that we have just had in this Parliament .

( RO ) We must ask ourselves what direction we want our education and research systems to go in .
It is important for every agreement to relax or eliminate restrictions on market access and investment opportunities , to maintain and enhance social and environmental standards , to provide adequate safeguards for data protection and privacy , to include mutual recognition of security standards and ensure a high level of passenger rights .
EU research ministers set up a long - term public - private partnership in February with the aim of getting hydrogen and fuel - cell technology ready for the market between 2015 and 2025 .
Mr President , Commissioner , the existing arrangements in the event of an accident involving radioactive contamination are totally out of touch with the current institutional situation .
After the need for food and clothing , the need for housing is a basic human need , after all , and for that reason , housing is one of the social public goods , and preventing homelessness is a social challenge .
Priority must be given to abolition of the death penalty .
It will be easier to carry out investigations and bring charges .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for this broad debate which has centred on some excellent resolutions tabled by the European Parliament , and may I congratulate the authors Mr Swoboda , Mr Thaler and Mrs Oomen - Ruijten .
The Council declared that ACP countries and regions , if they so wished , could depart where necessary from the provisions agreed by other countries or regions during EPA negotiations .
In fact , what I see today is that the Americans are coming closer to what have been traditionally European positions .
Any effort , then , to improve the work of this Parliament 's plenary sessions , on the basis of certain principles , is always welcome : firstly , the principle of efficiency , so that we hold discussions in order to arrive at options and finally decisions ; secondly , the principle of democracy , a level playing field for all , regardless of the power they wield , so that everyone gets a hearing ; and thirdly , the principle of ' vitality ' , I would call it , so that what we say is of interest to the public .
I therefore voted against the report .
I think we must be very clear today . We are guilty of failing in our legal duty to rescue .
The equipment used to scan the sheep is not accurate .
One of the key principles on which the European Union is founded is that of solidarity .
The progressive opening up of their markets , based on the principle of differential treatment , may contribute to the transfer of technology and know - how and to an improvement in their infrastructures .
However , we must be totally realistic and propose specific working instruments which will allow the correlation of innovation efforts at European , national and regional level .

These are all Members we never saw when we were doing the actual groundwork in order to steer the capital in the right direction .
The report recognises and praises the work done by the ECB in managing the crisis .
It might therefore be more appropriate to ask the Commission to undertake an impact assessment to examine how the legislation has worked and been received , rather than calling for even more stringent implementation .
The Presidency has also launched an initiative to establish a Platform of European Memory and Conscience , with the aim of raising public awareness about European history and the crimes committed by totalitarian regimes .
With reference to the subject of urban environmental health , and particularly the quality of indoor air , the Commission should do more to combat domestic pollution , given that Europeans spend on average 90 % of their time inside buildings .
At the same time , the government is not putting forward any short - term or long - term solution .
As regards the Fukushima power station , European unease is legitimate .
Lucky animals , because this resolution also shows that they are in some cases better protected than man .
Such moves away from democratic principles tarnish the European Union 's image as a whole .
Yet , Baroness Ashton , even successful elections do not make a democracy , nor do they make a state under the rule of law .
I would also like it to remain that way .
Monitoring of compliance with EU environmental , social and procurement standards has also come in for criticism from NGOs .
There is a special high - calibre , independent identification committee which is now preparing criteria .
This is a positive obligation resulting from the European Convention on Human Rights .
Perhaps .

Let us now defend the Christian minority and other religious minorities in Pakistan although , of course , this is not the only problem facing a country troubled by serious political conflicts and which , unfortunately , faces the prospect of destabilisation .
This shows that , in the face of the crisis , within this institution of the European Parliament , when political goodwill is present , high - quality political instruments are made available to our fellow citizens .

This is a crucial issue for democracy and I think that the President of Parliament should defend it .
We can also , when this is required by our security needs , invest outside the borders of the EU .
Mr President , ' let us not allow fear to guide us ' , we often say .
However , I believe that we have actually covered this in some ways , because we have not simply listed our criticisms of everyone , we have talked about us , about how we use - for better or for worse - the instruments available , and respect for EU law .
Another issue of high priority is , of course , the financial and economic crisis .
On the third question on priorities , you are absolutely right . Everybody is discussing this .
The Greek Communist Party is categorically opposed to the Stockholm Programme , just as it was opposed to previous programmes to implement the misleadingly entitled area of freedom , security and justice .
Thank you for your attention .
We have several European programmes that provide incentives .
I must say that I was very disappointed because we had a public workshop on this and not a single parliamentarian turned up to participate in the workshop .
For that reason , the Commission created a test phase for micro - credits with an instrument called JASMINE - also financed from European structural funds , and because this was so successful , a new instrument is intended to follow in its wake .
For this reason , the Commission will have to create a transparent procedure , so that its acceptance by industry and by the Member States can be assured , for we are dealing with very large sums here .
Finally , Madam President , I would therefore like to make a personal appeal to the European Commission to show the same drive that is now being exhibited in respect of cereals in other sectors too , as and when necessary .
I would urge the Commission to take its time and represent the EU countries ' interests fairly .
To date , the Common Agricultural Policy has focused principally on food quality , food safety and competitiveness , but it has been less involved in rural development outside of the area of agriculture .
There is cross - party concern that the current restrictions imposed by the European Commission are disproportionately costly and disruptive .
This is why we rejected them .
However , it is likewise not in our interest for the US to institute a policy that would favour its motor industry at the expense of competitors from other parts of the world .
As we await the so - called ' health check ' on the CAP , it is important that we deal with this issue now , to get it out of the way , as it were .
The memorandum goes on to insist on cuts in social welfare , the roll - back of key public services , and reductions in public sector employment and public sector pensions .
At this stage , let me pay tribute to two organisations in particular .
I call on the Commission to submit measures for a European scrapping scheme as quickly as possible .
In this regard , we must also make it clear that private investments are necessary , because the situation will be impossible without them .
We are making progress , and the Staes report shows this very clearly .
We currently have a debate ongoing about flexicurity .
For this reason , I do not think that the quota system ought to be frozen in all Member States , but each state ought to decide how to set their own quotas .
I believe that , at the time of the tenth anniversary of the launch of this policy , the proposals made in the Danjean report are extremely important in terms of improving the EU 's actions , which will certainly contribute to the security of European citizens and , ultimately , to peace and international security .
Proposals for deepening the Single Market , whether they are about removing the administrative barriers faced by small enterprises or stimulating e-commerce , must be for the benefit of the citizens .
Never before has China received so many expressions of solidarity and offers of tangible support because , this time , the Chinese authorities have not tried to hide the scale of the tragedy .
Last , but not least , I agree with most of you who were arguing for the need for a more strategic approach , the need for medium - and long - term solutions - this is exactly what the Czech presidency is planning to do .
I also welcome the change that clarifies further the interplay between the regulation on enzymes and the GM food and feed legislation .
When the majority of the European Parliament gets into the details , it is exactly the opposite ; nothing can in fact be left to the Member States .
The Government of Romania cannot intervene in any way .
We do not impose any sanctions - or next to no sanctions - on Turkey .
The rapporteur rightly notes that radioactive substances may continue to have an impact for a great many years , and the overriding aim should always be to protect human life and health .
I would like to ask you quite openly : Is it not the case that discrimination against the Roma is also one of the reasons why the community has not made use of such EU funds to date ?
Here , we value and protect each and every life ; we severely punish anybody who endangers human life ; and the punishment is more severe if attacks on life are against any minority and motivated by hate .
I am sorry about the long answer but the details were also substantial .
I voted for both Casini reports and I look forward to the strongest possible proposals from the European Parliament 's working group on the transparency and regulation of lobbying activities .

Nowadays in Europe , economically viable agriculture is a requirement for ensuring food security for its population .
For me or any other ordinary citizen to be able to travel abroad , I need a Carta de Libertad , that is a Freedom Card , just as the slaves did : only today it is called a Carta Blanca , a White Card .

According to one survey , during the first quarter of 2009 there were three times as many redundancies recorded as new jobs created across the European Union .
In recent years , the countries of Eastern Europe have been told that they should privatise their banks , in other words , that they should subordinate them to Western European banks .
Second , the directive offers only a partial answer to the question of who will pay for all this .
This would not necessarily need to involve long - distance travel , but , for example , could be organised by setting foot and meeting people at your local church , mosque , synagogue , temple or other places of worship .
Without doubt , the increased powers granted to the European Parliament under the Treaty of Lisbon enhance the role of the European Parliament considerably and formulate tangible and effective responses to the expectations of European citizens .
The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) plays a vital role in collecting data about drugs and drug addiction , adding to the store of objective , reliable and comparable data at European level , which provides a basis for analysing demand for drugs and ways of reducing it , as well as phenomena associated with the drug market in general .
Firstly , changes in duties at European Union level should encourage an increase in the production and distribution of goods and services , mainly by reducing red tape , but also by making it easier for national administrations to apply control procedures based on risk analysis .
( PT ) Mr President , it is true that this proposal for a directive discusses a wide variety of situations , including , for example , immigrant workers from third countries , seasonal workers and posted workers , but the truth is that what this represents in practice is the legalisation of social dumping , the reinforcing of job insecurity and the worsening of discrimination , under the pretext of a single regulation .
I also call for the strategies to be reconsidered , and for the techniques used by this Operation in the Indian Ocean to be reviewed urgently , along with how it is present there .
We regret that the proposals made by my group were rejected , particularly the definition of a limited set of general rules common to all vertical consumer protection instruments : this would ensure a high level of consumer protection with implementation of the approved method of minimum harmonisation combined with the country of destination principle , so as not to compromise existing national legislation .
For me , the future and the way the conflict in Nagorno - Karabakh is handled are a litmus test of what the sides want to show on European matters and how they demonstrate their credibility in this area .
However , it is also about another issue . It is about the direction of Europe as a whole and that is not your decision alone .
As a result , they should stop claiming that they can preach to the rest of the world .
Human rights are not negotiable and I hope that a majority of this House will also vote in favour of these common European human rights in our amendment .
We are about to begin a rather special vote , since , for all those who , like me , are due to leave Parliament , I think that this final moment spent together will be somewhat emotional .
Secondly , we have had a debate on ' flexicurity ' for a number of years which has also produced good guidelines in the Council , but this has not been reflected in the Integrated Guidelines .
Together we are strong .
( SK ) The Lisbon Treaty , which has strengthened the powers of the EU in the field of energy policy , should be actively exploited in order to overcome difficulties and prevent possible problems on the energy market .
This also means , however , that we have to take greater account of the gender aspect in all EU support programmes - whether for the development of rural areas , the Social Fund and the like - and make the programmes contingent upon how they continue to be used .
The current system of domain names and registrations works brilliantly .
You also raised the question of subsidiarity , and wondered whether a European initiative was needed .
He has not done anything criminal whatsoever ; he has acted entirely in accordance with the law and the Constitution .
There is something else we have sought to do , and this is also something that concerns the European public .

First , ratings are taken into account in banking regulations in order to determine the amounts of own funds that will be used to back investments .

I would like to stress that the treatment of third countries can be viewed in two different ways , depending on whether one is inside or outside the European Union .
The first is to divide farmers into large and small and destroy their unity in the trade unions .
I must say , it upsets me to have to openly state the fact - the fact that a child and his father who died on the Seine should receive different protection from what would apply if they had died on the open seas .
The citizens and institutions of all EU Member States should be keen for the best and the strongest candidates to become Commissioners .
I believe that it would be useful for Parliament to take a stand on this issue .

It is therefore extremely important for us to take all possible measures aimed at overcoming the demographic crisis in Europe .
This is the case even though the Commission is aware that Turkey is making nowhere near the required amount of progress in respect of the accession criteria .
Those of you who know me will be aware of just how committed I am to this matter .
I know they are not covered by the scope of this proposal , but many of Northern Ireland 's farmers feel let down when they work hard to meet the requirements laid down by Europe , and then have to compete with those who do not have to meet the same standards .

The European Parliament 's attitude to the future cooperation is important , particularly in view of the greater role that Parliament will have as a result of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The aim is to provide maximum security for Union citizens in all Member States .
I would particularly like to thank Mr Casaca , with whom I had the honour of working on the discharge of Parliament for the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .

People talk about having more time for legislative work .

I too support reducing carbon emissions in Europe and in the world , but not at any price .
If we Europeans are not going to take measures now to promote a common immigration policy , we will suffer the consequences later of not having done it on time .

It is also an expression of the agreements between the social partners .
It acknowledges that , since both the causes of discards and the measures needed to reduce them vary from fishery to fishery , no single solution will work throughout the Community .
Ladies and gentlemen , I have just heard that two Spanish soldiers have been killed by a mine in Afghanistan and others - also Spanish - have been seriously injured .
This would not surprise me , because we cannot achieve a change in this way .
Furthermore , the ESS report recognises that without development and poverty eradication , there will be no sustainable peace .
I repeat that we will also support any initiative that promotes dialogue between all the parties .
With this provision I agree with the report .
It also logically gives rise to the question of what the Commission would do if it was convinced that there was insufficient capacity in a certain area , or if , on the contrary , there was excess capacity .
We should not discuss this until we are blue in the face .
This response includes operational measures and financial assistance .
The Commission will know that three ' F ' gases are among the six major greenhouse gases .

On a personal note , as a young woman embarking on a political career , I stood as an independent candidate for the European Parliament , managing to obtain the necessary number of votes , without the help of a party list .

The Copenhagen climate summit may provide the opportunity for forest management to become an integral part of climate protection systems .
Subject : Development assistance in an economic crisis
Europe becomes stronger whenever European solidarity is shown .
But it is not quite like that : first , the grant is only 3.5 % of the cost of the damage - a gesture , as Mr Ashworth says - and , secondly , it is nine months after the event - and that is fast , they say !
in writing . - ( ET ) For years , experts on the right to food at the UN , the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have warned the global public of the possibility of famine .

Therefore , all we can do to overcome the humanitarian crisis is to appeal for an immediate ceasefire .
in writing . - ( PT ) Effective political intervention in the area of illegal immigration must act on two points of the problem , on the origin and on the destination : in other words , as stated in the adopted resolution , ' the authorities of the countries of origin , as well as the strengthening of the criminal legal framework to fight trafficking rings , combating illegal employment and human trafficking ' form essential elements .
Internet crime has proliferated , however , and the Internet has become a favoured tool of criminal networks , given that it is easily accessible , cheap and very powerful .
Living in a lone - parent or jobless household further compounds the risk .
This text has the merit of recognising market failures and advocating the fight against climate change .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , I would like first to express my deepest sympathy to the families of the victims and to all those who are affected by the industrial accident that occurred on 4 October in Ajka , Hungary .
In short , Parliament 's proposals contained solutions that could provide what companies need , that is , flexibility to adapt working hours to different workloads , because the fact is that no two sectors are the same , nor companies within each sector , and because what we need and what my country in particular needs - we hold the sad record of having the highest unemployment rate in the European Union - is for our companies to create more employment and fewer redundancies .
The response must be an agreement to revise the Interinstitutional Agreement rather than patching up edges of the financial rules every year when our backs are to the wall .
Moreover , the Commission had proposed the promotion of unsolicited credit ratings in order to deal with the disastrous issuer instructions for the evaluation of financial market products .
I voted in favour of this report in view of the fact that the results of the IMPASSE project have revealed that ' the degree of risk associated with alien species could be reduced considerably , possibly to an acceptable level , if the potential for escape of target and non - target organisms is addressed during transportation and by well - defined protocols at the receiving facility ' .
However , I abstained from the final vote because I believe that this report must be rooted more in reality and be more pragmatic and less ideological .
in writing . - ( FR ) In the light of the difficulty in finding new generations of European farmers , the European Parliament decided to look at the ways to promote the installation of young farmers , which should guide the CAP Health Check .
I can assure you that I have one overriding goal for the coming years ; to ensure that our Union is on track to be strong enough internally to maintain our own social model and externally to defend our interests and project our values .
Finally , I want to mention our third objective which , together with the challenge of climate change , the extension of social welfare and the affirmation of social rights , must be developed as a trade mark of Europe .
( HU ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased that the European Council is discussing the topics of energy security and innovation simultaneously .
The policy of sanctions and isolation we have pursued so far has not brought the anticipated results . It has failed to alter the repressive nature of the authorities .
The clarifications that she has brought to the treaty and the procedural guarantees are reasonable .
I believe that in this way it will prove possible to develop common unified requirements regarding the proper storage of digital materials collected in libraries and archives , and also digital materials - archived , I must stress - collected elsewhere than in archives , in other words in museums and libraries .
Your question will almost certainly be answered in writing .
This is , and must remain , the pillar of European integration .
This volcano has not finished erupting yet .
In the wake of several arrests of journalists and trade unionists , who have suffered violence and mistreatment , and of the refusal to grant entry to foreign journalists during the presidential elections , the repression against political opponents and human rights activists continues .
I wonder how this opening of the scope has actually advanced legal certainty and clarity .
This must be made very clear .
I hope that the Commission will now take this up .
I therefore welcome the Commission 's intention to assess the results of the German or British model first and only then to consider the possible way forward , not being pushed into a blind alley by the Socialists .
Consequently , the scope of the potential which promoting energy efficiency gives us , especially at a time of economic recession such as the one we are experiencing now , has not been fully understood .
I would also note that the Council referred to Article 9 in other conclusions : the conclusions on pensions and the conclusions of the Council on social services of general interest .
It is therefore impossible to achieve the positive unanimous decision of the Council necessary for further joint progress .
Oral explanations of vote
Patients with rare diseases will be able to benefit from cross - border expertise and diagnosis so long as the treatment is unavailable in their Member States .
We have said clearly that a 35 % reduction of CO 2 emission is the minimum and we would be prepared to go further .
It expresses its belief that the current definition of agricultural activity for the purposes of single payment should be reviewed , but proposes nothing to amend the current model in which people are paid to not produce .
That decision was adopted by the Council in December and we will now implement it .
I believe this should not be just a one - year story .
Substantial investments are required in order to gradually reduce dependence on fossil fuels , as well as modernise and make more efficient existing energy production facilities .
Madam President , I would like to have some guidance from the rapporteur on two issues .
Originally , we entered a level of 30 000 t of butter and 109 000 t of powder , but I have indicated recently that we will be able or willing to go higher than these figures by opening a tender .
If a VAT reduction is permitted , all countries should have the right to benefit from it , not just those which won that right , but this is an issue for the future .
What I said to the President of the Commission a couple of months ago was : ' Please do not oversell what the European Council decided in December 2008 .
Right now , the European Union is in crisis - in Spain , unemployment is nearly 20 % , in Latvia it is over 20 % , in many other countries , it is well over 10 % .
In the situation in which they are plunged as a result of the neoliberal policies advocated by the European Union , one could feel entitled to vote against the beggarly sum that the Eurocracy is reluctantly granting them .
The Commission , however , feels that repeated interventions in this sector would not be in the spirit of subsidiarity .
For example , there is a banner at the University of Vienna reading ' Make Bologna the process ! ' , which is very fitting , I think .
The question was not answered and should be answered .
Now I would like to be very clear on the principles that , in the Commission 's view , must necessarily be abided by for such a competitiveness pact , which it might be better to call a ' convergence and competitiveness pact ' , since it involves measures aimed at reducing differences within the euro area , and indeed within the European Union .
I voted against the report by Mr Vlasák on the urban dimension of cohesion policy in the new programming period .
In this way , we can make sure there are no scandals .
It is methodologically correct to review and update the content of conventions , as has been done on this occasion .
The Burmese regime should give her back full freedom of movement immediately and release all political prisoners , including those rounded up today .
With enormous courage and dignity he has adopted the austerity measures , whether they are feasible or unfeasible .
Poor control and inadequate follow - up of the resources granted every year as part of the EU funds ' projects have resulted in significant amounts of money going into the wrong pockets .
Human rights and good governance are for us the backbone of stability in our societies .
Tell me , specifically , do you now want us to say ' we do not want your gas until you respect human rights ' ?
This is why , in the new Commission , I have created a new ' International Cooperation , Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response ' portfolio .
Private capital has also dried up .
Moreover , there is also the issue of the incapacity to control access to and follow - up these products of animal origin once they enter the commercial system .
The future needs politicians brave enough to have their own opinions , who can look a bit further ahead , and who have a vision for a society with many more working mothers and many more caring fathers .
This mission will be to give grounds for hope , to come up with achievable plans for a future which is not built solely on conflict and inequalities and to offer a vision where science helps us to even out the imbalances which mankind has created or helped to exacerbate .
We had high hopes following the Treaty of Lisbon .
We have 25 million enterprises in Europe .
Thank you for your attention .
The debate is closed .
That , too , is social policy .
Mr President , I would like to take the floor as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) for the special European Ombudsman 's report .
Yet there are still barriers to the free movement of workers : firstly , legal and administrative obstacles that affect all aspects of citizens ' lives ; secondly , social dumping : although Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guarantees equal treatment for workers , the work of the Committee on Petitions proves that the reality is quite different ; thirdly , social protection , which varies from one country to the next and so does not encourage mobility .
The Commissioner says that we have attached harsh conditions to these loans , but I was not exactly clear as to what these conditions are and , indeed , if they include social conditionality .
Madam President , first of all I would like to thank Ms Polfer for her excellent work and excellent cooperation .
In particular , it is a useful tool against global warming .
The European Union should play a more active role in Ukraine ; we should stop the practice that has prevailed over the last few years of the European Union treating one of the largest states in Europe in an uncertain and half - hearted way .
There is a SOLVIT centre in every Member State of the European Union ( as well as in Norway , Iceland and Liechtenstein ) .
The Commission regards the southern corridor as a series of projects including Nabucco , South Stream and the Turkey - Greece - Italy interconnection ( ITG ) .
Just three months earlier , no one would have bet even a cent on it .
Join us at your peril .
A number of speakers raised the question of the legal base on which this particular provision has been made .
Where had they come from ?
We will have to wait some time to find out about the type of projects financed during this short space of time .
The use of the trade defence instruments has to be more accessible , more efficient and more transparent .
The European Commission should therefore concentrate on encouraging Member States to cooperate more closely with it by inviting them to include in future reports on human rights not just analyses of the situation in the world at large , but in individual Member States .
European unification is abhorrent to them and they are afraid that this Europe could gain popularity through greater democracy and transparency and also enhanced decision - making abilities to face the challenges of the future .
We need a different policy ; a policy that is open to all these people .
A mapping of EU Development Assistance in the water sector has been carried out to improve that ongoing dialogue .
And we have a common neighbourhood - some of you have mentioned that , be it Moldova or Nagorno - Karabakh or , of course , Georgia .
The report flags up a very serious problem and clearly illustrates the need for action to be taken against such a practice .
This is because of Israel 's continual violation of international law , and because of our political commitments to Palestine .
( The speaker agreed to take a question under Rule 149(8 ) )
They are late coming , but at least they are coming .
As spokesman for the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I regard the two items before us as being equally important : the Commission statement and Mrs Lucas 's report .
I also share the concern of Parliament and the rapporteur , who indicates that the resources for Bulgaria which have been frozen or withdrawn by the European Commission amount to almost EUR 1 billion .
( SL ) They say that a friend in need is a friend indeed .
I support the Commission 's proposal on the temporary suspension of the application of Common Customs Tariff duties , as I believe that the EU must demonstrate , and not just declare its solidarity with regions fighting the consequences of the economic crisis .
Mr President , I am happy to speak in favour of the ALDE Group motion to refer this back to committee .
Africa is a continent with rich natural resources , which are used by the whole world .
I hoped and expected that we would see this level of commitment from him with regard to cloned materials .
If nuclear power facilities which are available in Member States are switched on at full capacity , the shortage of energy could be overcome and this would influence prices of goods in the consumer basket .
in writing . - ( EL ) The package of economic governance measures proposed by the Commission makes provision for stricter discipline in the Stability and Growth Pact and budgetary supervision , by proposing penalties for ' undisciplined ' Member States .
My question is how the Commission is also active in this respect .
However , we must put under the microscope activities that were undertaken in the past on the basis of a surplus in this budget .
Documents received : see Minutes
9 .
The next few months will be crucial for budget policy : there will be urgent transfers ; there will be urgent amending budgets arriving over the next few months , to which it will be necessary to give a full response using a new procedure ; and it will be necessary , among other things , to debate a budget balances amending budget using a new procedure that will require great responsibility on the part of all the institutions .
This is an important measure , since it provides an equal opportunity for men and women in the labour market and an opportunity for them to combine their working and family lives .
That is a practice I have wished to encourage from both Council and Commission for a very long time , so congratulations to you both on achieving that .
The Member States are not satisfied .
Participation of Bulgaria and Romania in the EEC - San Marino Agreement on Cooperation and Customs Union ( vote )
It is simply unacceptable that the very same antibiotic costs EUR 3 in Belgium and EUR 34 in Germany , for example .
Vice - President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank Mrs Angelilli warmly for her remarkable report .
The argument is that the car industry is in financial crisis .
Directly acceptable : amendment 106 ( Text as a whole , Block No 1 , compromise amendment ) .
It is not I who decides who must support me .
This meant that , at best , they could only deal half - time with European affairs .
Now they are paying the price .
I wish the Kosovars and the Serbs great courage in this .
The Internet has no borders , so if we have different online gambling rules and provisions , it will be like the climate change problem ; much talk and , sadly , few results .
How do they keep those undue windfall profits ?
My question would be : should the European Union shift its focus from advertisements , which are commissioned by manufacturers ?
I refute those who argue that this is an illegal act .
Nobody is stopping the national governments from implementing it in a year 's time .
In particular , I would like to emphasise the positive nature of the new rules for the parliamentary assistants system , which will bear the hallmark of transparency and balance , while leaving a discretionary choice in the hands of MEPs .
Indeed , Member States are not providing the operational and effective regulatory services which would force companies to implement these regulations and penalise them financially for a failure to do so .
In this context , I welcome the proposal , which is repeated throughout the report , for spending to be planned prudently .
The European Union plays a difficult role on the stage of peace and war , and I ask , as the session opens , that Parliament should join in offering condolences and support to the families of the victims at this very difficult time .
We acknowledge that improvements need to be made , but we should not make additional requests , as these are unnecessary and will only lead to polarisation in this House .
The response was disproportionate .
A detailed and objective assessment of both countries ' compliance with the Schengen acquis has been completed .
( SL ) Congratulations Tanja .
Division of the country into two parts is unacceptable .
in writing . - I voted against this report in order to register my objection to the arrogance and disregard shown by political leaders throughout the EU towards the wishes of EU citizens , and to state very clearly that I believe the people of the EU should be given a referendum on this issue .
Mr President , honourable Members , following the conference in Copenhagen , the European Union decided quite quickly to proceed via a gradual , pragmatic approach in the future .
I accept that this is a test of credibility for the European Union , that any failure to respect the Serb population 's rights in the new Kosovo would be a victory for ethnic cleansing in reverse , and that we should emphasise that Serbia , as well as Kosovo , will be equal partners as future members of our European Union .
Should we , for that reason , stand there with our arms folded and do nothing ?
If Greece can demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to the reform package agreed with the European Union and the IMF , we will accompany Greece on its journey back to growth .
It appears from some of the speeches that some of you think that it is the Commission 's responsibility to make the decision to move forward at the right pace .
However , the most important and most difficult task is to change people 's habits .
( PL ) Madam President , the main reason for the current collapse in the financial sector is the irresponsibility of financial institutions , unsuitable risk management , bad loans and allowing excessive debts to arise without proper guarantees , which has ultimately led to a loss of liquidity .
I am thinking here of two hard - hitting proposals that we have made in the report : the first is to prevent discrimination and the stigmatisation of obese people by officially recognising obesity as a chronic disease , as has been done for example by the WHO and Portugal ; the second is to ensure that all schoolchildren have access to physical exercise and sport - two hours a week would be the minimum requirement in my opinion - along with better funding of school canteens so that fresh products are put on the children 's menu , and here I welcome the Commission 's initiative for the free distribution of fruit at school , as referred to by the Commissioner .
Nevertheless , we need measures that have to be taken in the foodstuffs chain throughout Europe .
A uniformly high level remains Europe 's best trump card in international competition .
If we listen to today 's discussions , it is quite clear where the greatest fears lie .
And some of these pirates are , of course , fed money as well , which makes it possible for them to invest in further resources .
To secure global economic stability we must work together to find the best way forward , to put credibility and confidence back into the financial institutions and market for citizens globally , but also for the citizens of Europe , for their pension funds and also for their savings .
( NL ) Mr President , listening to today 's debate one thing stands out , and that is the big issue - important to almost all the political groups - of economic governance .
While their companies are making profits on the European internal market , Germany and other countries are being thoroughly miserly when it comes to overcoming the joint challenges faced by Europe .
2 .
They will try to create advantages for people on the basis of this legal foundation .
There is a danger that global warming will increase the gap between the developed and the developing countries ; there is no doubt that they will be most affected by the impact of climate change .
I therefore hope that these measures will be adopted as soon as possible within a broader support framework for small and medium - sized enterprises , which need to operate in an easier economic and fiscal environment .
These are past commitments ; this is a question of credibility : when we pay what we said we would pay , we are simply doing what we ought to do , even if it goes beyond the payment appropriations .
I can only support the rapporteur , Mrs Gomes , and I agree fully with the goal of the adopted chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear ( CBRN ) Action Plan .
China 's economic growth and increased international standing have still not resulted in any real difference in the approach to civil liberties , abuse of power by the authorities , room for opposition and independence of the judiciary .
This irresponsible attempt was foiled due to the acumen of the Italian MEPs .
Finally , the public image of the euro - a currency that is widely identified with the image of the European Union - does not reflect all the objective benefits that it brings to citizens .
These have very little own capital ; they are highly leveraged .
This could be one way of reducing CO 2 emissions , but it is important - and I am speaking as a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , for which I was the shadow rapporteur - that we generate the hydrogen from renewable energies .
I support the report , which calls for important framework conditions for closed aquaculture facilities and strictly defines the prerequisites for the introduction of exotic fish species .
Congratulations !
Particular attention must be given to North - South networks .
Regarding the issue of revaluation of the Slovak currency , I must say that it always took place within the expected limits , within the framework of flexibility that each government , each country is allowed in this process in order be able to respond , in the best possible manner , to the extraordinary moment when the euro is adopted .
After our experience with BSE , I do not believe that we should go down this route , nor do I believe that this is necessary if an adequate supply of soya and maize is available to farmers .
Consequently , I think that the decoupling levels should be maintained as agreed in 2003 and in any event , if that is not possible , I think that Member States should be given some room for manoeuvre , as a voluntary model for each sector , on a case - by - case basis , could create the best circumstances for agricultural production .
Another report that seems very important to me is Youth on the Move , one of the main aims of which is to address early school leaving .
We are talking about whether the extremely complicated and bureaucratic provisions that we currently have in place should be applied to all businesses if , in the first stage of the procedure , they are able to prove that there is absolutely no risk , or that the risk is sufficiently controlled .
( Parliament adopted the motion )
The imposition of standards , codes , market rules and even decisions by higher authorities , serving the interests of economic groups , is a recurrent argument .
As regards Croatia 's imminent EU accession , it is regrettable that border disputes with Slovenia remain outstanding .
This is a report that will help as much as possible to provide more stability and we must ensure as far as possible that all the countries are harmonised with regard to the applicable rates to reduce discrepancies as much as possible .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , Pakistan is on the agenda of this plenary for the third time within a few months .
Finally , I am convinced that under the present circumstances a positive conclusion to the Doha negotiations could prove to be a factor of stability for the entire world economy .
In fact , if we do not , not only will we be guilty of maintaining a situation which fosters bio - piracy and is a crime at present towards local communities and genetic resources ; we will also miss yet another opportunity for the environment , the negotiations will collapse and we shall have a second Copenhagen .
Mr President , it is really interesting to hear how some Members are very irritated by this famous one voice being challenged and the whole status quo being challenged .
As regards heading 4 , it is extremely important to leave a substantial margin to the ceiling under this heading in order to be able to cope with unforeseen needs in the best possible way .
We also need to start thinking about innovative proposals that we ourselves have put forward in our parliamentary debate and which are now being taken up in a more authoritative way by leading figures such as Chancellor Merkel .
I think that 25 % compensation for maritime passengers for two to three hours ' delay is perfectly appropriate , as is 50 % for delays of over three hours - but I would say to Mr Teychenné that 100 % compensation for delays in excess of this is simply excessive .
They were produced more cheaply than under the system of green certificates and , most importantly , this made it possible to introduce new players into the electricity market .
Need I spell out exactly what will be required of the Irish in relation to the Lisbon Treaty ?
Thus , for example , the Council can blacklist individuals responsible for the repressive measures of recent months .
I received a petition from European textile producers expressing their opposition to this , as they were afraid that Pakistan would export more to Europe , which they did not want .
This clearly demonstrates that the WHO needs to revise its pandemic criteria .
( GA ) Mr President , we are undoubtedly facing a great challenge at present and we urgently need to look at new ways of solving all those problems .
In my opinion , any intervention on an EU level would be an intervention in subsidiarity and would therefore go too far .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Mr President , once a beacon of hope , an example of African self - empowerment and a leader among African states , Zimbabwe is now the epicentre of African despair and hopelessness .
What we see is that the Council has not always followed the Commission 's proposals , whether on transparency or prospectuses , the definition of cross - border missions or equivalences .
That is , allowing them to remain active and not to stop after retirement .
We must avoid double standards and show that we will act in accordance with our values in European Union foreign policy .
It was I who launched the campaign ' Do you know where your child is now ? '
I worked as a volunteer in Malawi for a few months and I was appalled at the treatment of women there .
They have their own agenda , a European agenda , and they are an integral part of European political life .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( ES ) Madam President , on behalf of my group , I would like to first of all congratulate Mr Schmitt on this report , and also stress the importance of increasing the number of hours of teaching of physical education in schools .
Schengen cooperation is now integrated into the European Union legal and institutional framework and comprises 25 Schengen Member States , along with three countries that are associated with the EEA : Norway , Iceland and Switzerland .
Four years ago , Mr Saakashvili said in this Chamber that Georgians are not only one of the oldest nations of Europe , but that they are also intensely interested in European integration .
This is a concrete proposal which would enable us to address the over - reliance of the global financial regulatory system on some non - public credit ratings .
in writing . - UKIP fully supports the relief efforts and is horrified at the loss of life and those affected by the disaster , but we cannot support legitimising the EU in spending hundreds of millions of taxpayers ' money , along with its militaristic and diplomatic ambition to circumvent democratic and accountable nation states intervening in the crisis .
However , they are also directed at the Council , which will meet again in December in response to the progress report .
Opening of the sitting
There is not much more to add since I feel that the President - in - Office of the Council has described the results splendidly .
The 100th anniversary of that event falls in the very year we are talking about - 2014 .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , I support this Treaty change and my group supports it , because we want to see stability within the eurozone .
In 1992-1996 , Sarajevo - the martyr city where , in 1914 , the First World War started - would become the victim of destruction during the time it was besieged .
At its best remote sensing is a way to obtain information quickly on the condition of farms , crop yields and growing conditions .
We thus call on the Commission and Council to take specific measures here .
In season three of the Simpsons , ' Homer Alone ' , the same issue is addressed .
In particular , the report proposes a harmonisation of penalties by means of a common categorisation of fines .
- ( EL ) Mr President , the Slovenian Presidency is very fortunate to be following on from two successful presidencies .
This plan looks to recognise and reward proactive organisations that go beyond what environmental laws expect of them and that are constantly improving the way they interact with the environment .
In addition , there was a special focus on rules .
As others have said , the legal fishing sector is under severe threat and the impact of this illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing is just part of the problem .
Mr President , I rise to express my concern about thousands of innocent civilians who have been turned into refugees in their own homeland by the Taliban in the Swat Valley .
I do not support the ban on exporting radioactive waste , but I call for all the specific contracts signed between Member States and third countries to comply with Recommendation 2008/956 / Euratom on criteria for the export of radioactive waste and spent fuel to third countries .
I would like to say to Mr Schulz that I entirely agree with him .
I consider it essential to guarantee children and pregnant women good health conditions .
However , I would like to mention two aspects .
It is the result of a long and complex negotiation process between the European Commission and Mauritania that was launched in October 2007 , following serious under - utilisation of the protocol by European ship - owners , namely under - utilisation for cephalopods and the small pelagic species .
To date , we have 21 organisations in 15 Member States .
Moreover , as Commissioner Barnier has also pointed out , I believe that both Italian and Spanish companies will also benefit from the creation of the unitary European patent system .
It is our duty to take care of and ultimately also to enforce their right to mobility .
Electronic stability control could save the lives of around 4 000 people every year , and if the in - vehicle emergency call system e-Call were fully deployed throughout Europe , the number of road injuries and fatalities could be reduced by as much as 5-15 % . This would save more than 2 500 lives every year and represent financial savings of EUR 22 billion .
There is a dual perception of wilderness in European culture .
The ultimate aim of these proposals is to generate greater market demand in order to boost production and support the European economy as a whole .
To add insult to injury , the recent revelations about members of this House who agreed to amend or write legislation in exchange for payment further erode the credibility of this Parliament , particularly in its efforts to fight fraud and corruption .
I would like to stress that the European Union budget is not a budget of the same kind as the national budgets .
Parliament rightly highlights its new role as colegislator on the same footing as the Council after the Treaty of Lisbon comes into force .
The report included an assessment of achievements and shortcomings .
I listened to the talk about greening .
Some Member States have tried to resolve these problems by working with the UN , but these efforts , however , have proved unsuccessful .
Put the Lisbon Treaty to the vote .

I ask the European Commission to support the new Member States in accessing the available Community instruments to develop transport infrastructure .
I think you will agree with me when I say that Europe and the Europeans have good reason to feel satisfied with political developments over the last six months .
These tests can be passed only if we all give of our best .
A perfect example , once again , of how profits are privatised and losses nationalised .
It is of great concern that only 3 % of European agricultural output is of protein crops .
Mrs Fontaine gave a good outline of the strong recommendations it contains .
4 .
With regard to Mrs Beňová 's question about fundamental rights , it is precisely in order to give this new sign of commitment that I decided to create - and I would add that the proposal came from the European Parliament , even though I was already convinced on the matter - the post of commissioner responsible for fundamental rights and individual freedoms .
As the speed of integration of the countries in this region varies , every country must make maximum effort , carry out the required reforms and take the necessary measures to ensure the security and stability of every country , as well as of the region as a whole .
It is also worth bearing in mind that the largest producers of these raw materials are located outside the European Union and that in comparison , the position of the Member States is very poor indeed .
I voted in favour of this proposal since I believe it is a matter of great importance for Portugal , and particularly for its outermost regions , which are more vulnerable to the crisis we are experiencing , since they feel its effects more intensely and take longer to emerge from it .
I therefore call on you to conclude a common package with Bosnia and Albania and to start visa talks with Kosovo .
I should be grateful for your comments on these points .
Experience has taught us that all dictatorships come to an end !
I would be very pleased if everything that Mrs Kolarska - Bobińska has written and that has received the support of a large majority is actually retained .
We made a mistake , and we admit it .
If we do that - not through monoculture - then we can find biofuels to be part of the solution .
Is there anything more ridiculous ?
The Commission target does not just come from nowhere . According to the motor industry , it is technically achievable and can generate an innovative export product .
With the help of the European Union , will we manage to gather the required political will and ensure alternative means of transporting passengers so that we can avoid such consequences in similar crisis situations .
In some cases they have been forced to give way to wishy - washy , colourless and insipid compromises .
Every effort must therefore be made to protect a child 's right to a family life .
The implementation of the abortive anti - labour law on the ' liberalisation ' of services , known as the Bolkestein Directive , promotes sweeping reactionary changes at the expense of the working and grassroots classes .
We need to facilitate the cooperation between Member States on a daily basis .
We need to finalise the agreement .
The growth in freight transport may necessitate a supplementary infrastructure to prevent the two interfering with each other .
Parliament is a European institution , the Commission is a European institution and the Council is also a European institution .
I am happy to listen to the views of those of you in the Chamber and to speak again at the end .
Care will also have to be taken to protect shareholders and creditors .
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to raise a point of order : I do not have my voting card with me because it was not planned that there would be a vote now , and so I ask you to note my wish to vote in favour of the order of business remaining unchanged .

Besides the Leipzig Charter and the Territorial Agenda , the First Action Programme under the Portuguese Presidency , territorial cohesion was included as a Community objective in the Reform Treaty .
We understand that continuous and sustained support for the economic development of the Palestinian territories is one of the bases for peace .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the theory of a Tobin tax has been around for years - the idea of a global tax on foreign exchange - but , of course , it has never seen the light of day .
Are these observation missions important ?
That was a comprehensive statement of the theoretical position on burden - sharing .
Moreover , it should be inclusive , above all , for the more than 20 million Europeans who feel excluded because they have been shut out of the labour market by the brutal crisis .
I voted for this report because it is extremely important .
My group does not accept the compromise that the Presidency and the rapporteur laboriously arrived at , not because we are opposed to a European return policy but because we feel that the result is very inadequate as regards protecting fundamental rights .
As I mentioned , Japan has very high food safety standards .
in writing . - ( PT ) What happened today in the vote in plenary session was regrettable .
There have , of course , been comments in this Chamber to the effect that this is not the most important of matters in the wider scheme of things , and no doubt it is not .
I do not think that many people believed it , but our perseverance has paid off .
( NL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the debate on the Florenz motion for a resolution , it was rightly observed yesterday that a large majority of the population support strict measures to ban smoking at the workplace and in bars and restaurants .
Any ESDP operation in Chad and the Central African Republic must be based on a UN Security Council resolution and will be conducted in strict consultation with the UN and our African partners .
At this point , I would like to address Mr Tremopoulos , who , if I may say , is hardly in a position to speak like this , because it is precisely his country which has just recently received a much bigger amount than Bulgaria is claiming at the moment , due to its blackmail .
According to the proposed regulation , operators must minimise the risk of placing illegally logged timber and related products on the market by demonstrating due diligence , when they place these products on the European Union market , in obtaining information on the provenance and legality of the products in question .
Statistics represent only a starting point in developing adequate housing policies for each Member State .
This is also what it means to be part of Europe .
They do not want any more indiscriminate immigration from Eastern Europe .
In this context , I believe that we need a strategy .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
I would like to conclude by reminding you that the right to effective legal protection is a fundamental right enshrined in European constitutions and , specifically , in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .
We are interdependent on each other in the challenges that attack us , but also in the solutions which we can arrive at .
A high percentage of them have happened in the so - called free trade zones with their maquiladora industry ( sub - contractor companies which produce for the export market ) , in which the absence of a social infrastructure and high poverty rates are accompanied by impunity for semi - legal security forces .
That is mostly in this part of Europe , where there is no emergency situation .
Mr Landsbergis , do not tell untruths .
All in all , Mr President , I am extremely grateful for what has been said by all the spokespeople for the different parliamentary groups .
The debate is closed .
We had originally agreed to put it on the agenda on the assumption that everything was in order .
In the negotiating result achieved after two months , not all that much remained of the recommendation by the Committee on the Environment and that was due not to the rapporteur , but to the uncompromising position of the Council .
This will therefore be the spirit in which the Commission 's measures are coordinated .
( NL ) Mr President , the text before us is , indeed , a compromise and we would have liked to have been a little more ambitious here and there , particularly when it comes to the timing and the level of the penalties .
The petitioner is told beforehand what he might ask for , which is something within the competence of the Commission , and what he might not ask for , which is something deemed by the Commission to be lacking in seriousness or contrary to so - called European values .
It is therefore becoming more and more difficult to ensure consistency .
It is not up to us , as Europeans , to say what the composition of these countries ' governments should be .
We need to prepare a mid - term review based on concrete data in order to ensure that the Seventh Framework Programme continues to meet European requirements .
I think it is important to remind ourselves about this , from where we are now .
I expressly welcome the decision by the government to comply with the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution and hand over the competent provincial council to the elected representatives of the north and the east .
It will be beneficial to extend the reduced rates to babies ' nappies and equipment for people with disabilities , electronic books , environmental sewerage and recycling works , as well as all housing , places of worship and cultural and artistic heritage , restaurants , gardening and personal care services .
Can we expect an increase in demand for these tankers , and will Russia 's fleet of tankers receive the necessary investment to avoid further use of single - hull , 40 - year - old tankers and vessels designed for river use ?
For this reason I consider the package of decisions adopted by the European Commission with the aim of boosting flexibility in drawdowns from the Structural Funds by Member States to be a positive response to the ongoing economic crisis .
There were signs that if Ireland did not accept the document , it would have to keep voting until the required outcome was achieved .
Secondly , taking into consideration the cultural particularities of the Roma people , the solution for its integration should be found at European level by drafting a coherent and comprehensive strategy .
We are asking for time , ladies and gentlemen , Mr President , to allow us to come back to Parliament within a few weeks , a few months , to be able to guarantee that we have created the foundations for the signing of a definitive agreement that adequately addresses the concerns expressed by certain honourable Members today .
We have therefore voted for Parliament 's approval of the proposal .
We are talking about the European Schools today , and I am grateful to Mrs Hennicot for that .
What has the Council actually done with the findings , both our findings and the findings of the Council of Europe ?
We had refused to talk to Mr Haniyeh and , not surprisingly , having undermined the democratic forces , the forces of violence took over .
Hopefully , future Ecofin meetings would enhance better approaches regarding financial assistance .
Poverty and dependence on imports are the main cause of food insecurity .
For this reason , we can only call on the government to change .
Are we going to abide by the Council 's decision , under pressure from one Member State , which shows a certain lack of regard for the Union and the European citizens ?
Vice - President of the Commission . - Mr President , on behalf of the Commission , I would like to give the following explanation .
However , we cannot accept the argument that , in order to serve the interests of the citizens better through improved management of post - disaster situations , we need to limit the Member States ' involvement and room for manoeuvre .
What is your justification for this ?
This is an important issue .
Although practical tests at national level have yielded quite positive results , opinions on these vehicles differ .
This is what I urge the Commission and the Council to do .
We are going to present the new Stockholm programme 2010-2014 in a communication in Spring 2009 .
1 .
However , my support is conditional on these changes not hampering transparency or resulting in account users having limited access to information .
While the first pillar , financed solely from the EU budget , must support the level of societal demands that we attach to agriculture , the second , cofinanced pillar must continue to support the modernisation of agriculture and agri - foods so as to take the new contexts into account .
in writing . - I was delighted to vote in favour of the extension of the mandate of the European Network and Information Security Agency ( ENISA ) until September 2013 .
I would also like to thank Mrs De Keyser and Mr Salafranca for their detailed and stimulating report .
The process of ratification should continue , and I am confident that Ireland will make every effort to resolve the situation .
How can we guarantee the fundamental right of all European citizens to move freely within our common area without offering them the opportunity to be treated easily in a Member State other than the one in which they are resident ?
This method cannot provide a long - term solution , given the risks it poses to our ecosystem .
That is the only way to prevent separatism .
I can tell you that seeing the new message , strategy and philosophy that I detect at the World Bank makes me quite optimistic .
As regards the European Economic Recovery Plan , the EU 's budget is not of such magnitude as to be able to be used for Keynesian stimulus policy , but it can be used for certain small but strategic matters , such as the Recovery Plan .
The Council of the European Union is about to adopt a new joint action on landmines within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
But we shall see .

Protection for investors has been improved and transparency has been increased .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - Madam President , can I thank the High Representative , Baroness Ashton , for her statement .
Five thousand lobbyists out of the 15 000 operating in Brussels have access to the European Parliament .
In this context , we explicitly ask the Commission to publish a report next year on the adequacy of the standards as they currently stand , on whether it is desirable , possibly , to do some more work on what is known as the list of minor foodstuffs and on whether it is still appropriate to maintain that list any longer .
Nowadays , at least in the European Union , civil aviation is a necessary part of our life , without which the Parliament and the Council simply could not work .
We would do better to recognise it and prepare responses to it .
Yes , let us applaud the Czech Senate all the way from Strasbourg to Prague .
All negotiations in the IGC and the linguistic lawyers ' group have been kept absolutely secret so far as many Members in this Parliament are concerned .
I have not heard a single word about this .
For here too it holds that words are one thing , actions are what counts .
That is why I call on you to work with the Member States to implement as quickly as possible the four - year action plan on combating counterfeiting and piracy , with the creation of a European counterfeiting observatory and the strengthening of the European customs system .
The Directive provides a framework to upgrade the energy performance of the EU 's buildings .
Unfortunately , we are finding out more day by day , and we are faced with an issue which needs us to show flexibility and collective intelligence to find suitable solutions .
It is a mistake .

I hope that this will happen in the future .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety . - ( EL ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report is complete and coherent .
We have witnessed a contraction of gross domestic product , a drop in economic activity and an increase in budget deficits , resulting in reduced tax receipts and creating unsustainable public debt : it has been difficult to achieve figures comparable with those existing before the crisis .
We spoke with great approval of the effects of his work when he was a guest here in the European Parliament .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , this discussion today on the Europe 2020 strategy has been extremely interesting and useful for us , the Commission , as was this morning 's discussion on economic governance .
For this same reason , I consider it crucial to strengthen the Commission 's control procedures relating to the application and usage of the Cohesion Fund , reinforcing the mechanisms of good governance .
I see the way forward as prioritising such policies that would decrease the pressure on capital cities and support the development of second - tier cities .
These include intellectual property .
The Network addressed four questions to the spring summit on 10 March , and the European Parliament should specifically endorse these questions .
Furthermore , the new anti - terrorist ordinance must be urgently brought into line with internationally accepted standards , safeguarding personal rights and freedoms .
We must , however , get something straight here : this is the result of badly coordinated , local public transport that has been economised to death , the boom in shopping centres on the edges of towns whilst local shops are in decline , the falling quality of living conditions in the inner city , the rising crime rate , neighbourhoods that are home to large numbers of foreigners turning into ghettoes and , last but not least , longer journey times to work owing to urban sprawl and greater flexibility in working hours and employment relationships and the associated role of the car as a prerequisite for gainful employment .
Therefore I wish to ask Mr Lobo Antunes very directly indeed : what are you waiting for to demand that the European governments and the US Government put an end to this practice that we have condemned on so many occasions ?
Of course we will not get it through the G 20 if we do not even try it first at European level !
The rich industrial States of the EU are now obliged to support the poorer countries financially so that immediate measures can be taken to counter the consequences of climate change .
At the same time , for certain sectors of industry which have a particularly serious environmental impact , minimum mandatory requirements must be set at European Union level .
It is absolutely clear that there is currently a majority of transport ministers in the Council to whom environmental interests are of no concern .
We would also welcome it if your planning were not only to cover the first few months of 2009 but were perhaps to encompass a two - year cycle which could be developed further on a year - by - year basis .
I think it is crucial that , by imposing sanctions , the European Union reveals its strengths and not its weaknesses .
In fact , Sweden has taken a step backwards rather than taking the opportunity to push for more challenging objectives in the area of the environment and climate change .
Yes , we do need to denounce and stop the abuses that are committed by one or the other of the warring parties in that region , but we need to be very careful with regard to the procedure used if we want the justice to be established in the region to lead us in the direction of a lasting peace .
Madam Ashton will , on that point too , have to seek very active coordination with Turkey , more active than has hitherto been the case .
We always take into account the need to increase the coverage of this public register .
This is why I am asking the House to agree that in this exceptional case , we should remove this urgent matter from the agenda , because this will be of greater help in resolving the case than debating it would be .
This proposal is exploiting admirable humanitarian responses to the appalling tragedies that we have seen in order to take further steps towards the creation of the European protection force called ' Europe Aid ' as outlined in the Barnier report .
It is demanded of politicians that they be capable of doing something for the communities that they serve .
It is a process that is made easier not by strict constraints that create unaffordable costs for citizens and businesses , but by real incentives ; a process that is realised by means of energy infrastructure , changing urban development , products , packaging and transport .
Of course , we can apply new technology and new research with all the will in the world , but if we continue to have a system where , despite all the innovation , governments tell individual fishermen in detail how much they can fish , then all the applied research will be a complete waste of time .
It is important , therefore , to enter into the dialogue with the assumption that the vast majority of the Muslim communities who live in our society want nothing to do with what is a perverse interpretation of their faith , and that we invest a great deal in that broad dialogue of my group , this year too , the year of cultural dialogue .
I agreed with this resolution on FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreements with the Republic of Cameroon and the Republic of Congo .
As I said this weekend at Camp David , open societies need the rule of law and democracy .
The situation in Egypt is similar , even though things are moving fast .
As you have recognised , the importance of adult learning is clearly increasing .
However , when it comes to the actual legislation we always take a nifty step backwards .
I deplore that innocent civilians are used as human shields .
That is why I am speaking today .
Voting time
In the kingdom of Eurocrats , a clear conscience comes cheap .
The aim of the present proposal is to merge two existing Council regulations on internal and external promotion into one single regulation .
That should not be the case .
That is why the Commission can support the amendments put forward in Mrs Angelilli 's report . They will then pave the way for a successful first - reading agreement with the Council .
They could never have got these rules through the national parliaments .
Let us not have any illusions however .
I would like to emphasise the fact that it was others who did not take them into account .
Why has this not been monitored more intensively ?
Firstly , we very much welcome the fact that the European Commission has included a proposal for a European Company Statute in its legislative programme for next year .
That letter also announced the suspension , from 1 January 2009 , of disbursements from the budgetary aid programmes , as well as the opening of a consultation period with the Nicaraguan authorities concerning the current situation and the methods of reorienting European cooperation with the country .
It is for that reason that I am voting against this report .
We are shutting people out and , in so doing , we are putting lives at risk .
What specific measures will it undertake to that end , and within what time - framework ?
We saw similar scenes in my home country , the United Kingdom , last year when Excel Airways went bankrupt , leaving over 200 000 people out of pocket , without compensation and stranded at a whole host of airports throughout Europe , with it costing them even more money to find accommodation and flights home .
( The sitting was closed at 10.10 p.m. )
Let me reassure you that we acknowledge the new role of Parliament in line with the Treaty of Lisbon .
In the light of this quality drive for European wine , there is also a continuing need for national support measures , and these have been set at EUR 1.3 billion .
I should say that French hunters are quite satisfied that the four categories have been maintained : this is an important issue in France , and I am very pleased this evening that we managed to retain them .
The Transport Committee has argued for this in the case of airlines , and it is right to require that hotels , too , should not discriminate against this social group .
The new logic of economic organisation based on innovations in environmental technology , which has the support of international capital markets , is also a fundamental feature of the US President Barack Obama 's programme .
It is a question of political will , Mr Reinfeldt , Mr Barroso .
Where an international couple decide to divorce , they may therefore invoke different laws .
It must surely be illegal for the Czech Republic to transfer to the US any information from common EU databases , such as the Visa Information System .
Transparency is needed in particular when combating the crisis we are currently experiencing .
Greater unity does not mean that we have to lose diversity .
We will make sure that this evidence is provided to the European Parliament with concrete examples , both from the three countries we are discussing and from the subsequent EU PNR .
Mr Simpson 's absence demonstrates that the issue is indeed still current , and that the consequences of such eruptions are unpredictable and can be far - reaching in terms of our citizens ' mobility , and also in economic terms if the situation is protracted .
The problem with this text is that only a few categories of goods are provided for in the current proposal for a regulation .
We need effective strategic plans which include appropriate EU financial aid for promoting democracy , civil society and human rights .
( CS ) Madam President , illegal employment not only affects five to ten million people but , in particular , those who employ them .
This , in fact , opens the way for a network where it is not a foregone conclusion that all users will have access to the whole network and where not all sites have the same possibility of being viewed .
We should not try and do everything .
Europe will thus be able to take this leadership forward and create jobs on its own territory and , at the same time , create a win - win situation with global solutions .
- ( LT ) From reading the guide to the European Union I still remember it stating that the Member States ' solidarity is one of Europe 's most significant values , with small countries , i.e. the Benelux countries , being the real driving force behind the EU internal market .
I was not shocked by your defence of industry in general and German industry in particular , because I see too often - I say this to Mr Schulz , as well as to Mr Daul - I see too often the devastating effects of the financial crisis in countries that have not defended their industries strongly enough .
This is therefore about strengthening the role of the European Parliament .
Therefore , I should like to thank the Commissioner for her response , as it contains positive elements to help us really achieve something of benefit to 500 million European citizens .
I have a few political comments to make on the actual budget which we are voting on this year and I say political , because the political role of the budget should ultimately be to allow us , through the budget , to play our part as the European Union .
I would like to thank everyone for their work on this dossier over recent years .
( EL ) Madam President , it is widely accepted that the current distribution of seats in the European Parliament does not properly represent the demographic realities in the Member States and that the correlations are unfavourable for certain medium - sized and smaller countries .
I even recovered industrial waste from a mountain which had been designated as a household waste tip and we also saw an out - of - order incinerator , or at least what appeared to be one .
Albino killings in Tanzania ( vote )
This is why we have faced the problem of shark finning in recent years .
However , compliance with imported products to equivalent quality specifications remains a problem .
Today , if we make no changes , we shall reach 19 % .
I also want to highlight the lack of women 's rights particularly in the third world .
This is why I think that it must be improved and promoted by us and Member States so that as many European citizens as possible learn about SOLVIT 's existence and can defend their rights by calling upon SOLVIT for assistance .
Consumers therefore have no idea whom to trust .
This is the result of nation - destroying liberal thinking , among other things .
Many congratulations on this convincing result !
Written explanations of vote
Why can there not be a Citizens ' Initiative calling for the treaty to be amended and for the further development of the European Constitution ?
To sum up briefly , my compliments to Mrs Ayala Sender on her report and I hope that the course embarked upon can be taken further later on in the year .
One agency after another is created , in order to be paid for consent to difficult topics by an undertaking for an interesting agency . '
Then the other side will arrange for humanitarian aid to be taken to Gaza .
It is a theory and a very long way from proof .
Russia 's bans on imports of Polish meat and vegetables continue to form a major obstacle to the start of negotiations .
At the same time , however - and this is the core of our concern , I believe , and I understand it is also that of some of my fellow Members - public television broadcasters are absolutely vital in protecting our cultural and linguistic diversity and ultimately in binding our societies together because , in theory , they are looking for something more than direct profit .
To reiterate , this is a success story : it demonstrates how Parliament and the Commission can work together .
International law and moral principles give the European Union the opportunity of accelerating the granting of legal status to individuals whose life in their country of birth , outside the European Union , is impossible .
Firstly , the adoption of earthquake protection measures should in future be an essential requirement for the funding of infrastructure from the Structural Funds , especially in view of the fact that earthquakes threaten the overall economic and social cohesion of the regions affected .
In the latter case , responsibility will partly be in the hands of countries which are not Member States , giving the unelected Commission a major say .
Mr President , I have seen that the entire western world , with the United States at the forefront , is demanding an earlier election in Pakistan .
Mr President , I am sorry to interrupt the voting at the end but I think there was one error .
Time to step on the gas .
Europe buys 38 million tonnes of soya and feed for cattle .
You know what is my bible ?
The text voted on today is the fruit of a very hard - fought compromise , but one which pleases us given the direction taken in the debate and in the negotiation itself .
However , 400 kilometres in Europe means crossing borders .
We do not need a bloated EU budget that is perhaps up to ten times higher than necessary ; we do not need a budget funded by the EU taxpayer that has lost any sense of the need to economise ; we do not need a further bloating of Brussels bureaucracy that robs the shirts from the backs of the net contributors .
As we know , although displaced inhabitants always leave very quickly , their return takes time and is all too often a source of considerable humanitarian and social problems .
The primacy of Community law is thus established over national legislation and even national constitutional provisions .
It is important to debate this .
Mr President , may I first of all congratulate Mrs Gutiérrez - Cortines .
It is clear that the biggest threats come from two directions : nuclear weapons that are in the hands of undemocratic regimes which are answerable to no one and the irresponsible use of civilian nuclear resources .
However , this position was only the viewpoint of the Communist Party of Greece , not of our group as a whole , which supported my proposals , as did the vast majority of this Parliament .
We must also improve the way in which we manage our resources , including the management of restructuring funds .
The European Union Special Representative and the European Commission will also continue their efforts to build confidence in support of a resolution of the conflicts in Georgia .
One is to provide assistance following the misfortune that has recently befallen it .
The real crisis is not in the subprime mortgage market but rather in the ten times larger casino economy of the increasingly esoteric and fantasy world of the derivatives market , which needs to be brought under control .
Lithuania is a Member State of the EU and has thus undertaken to share these common values of the 500 million citizens of the Union .
However , we also know the price to be paid for not having a Europe ; we have paid it enough throughout our history .
This is why I consider referenda to be a key aspect of the Treaty ratification process .
Please allow me to add that not only do these results allow us to feel satisfied , but they also give prestige to our institutions : Parliament , the Council and the European Commission .
That is why it pains me all the more to have to pour cold water on this matter .
Mr Leichtfried , when you rightly spoke about the political problems that we have encountered , the political problems concern the Member States , but we have seen that unfortunately , the Commission 's proposal was not accepted , despite a huge effort .
This type of behaviour can only be encouraged .
Mr Barroso used it , Mr Van Rompuy used it : ' stability ' .
We have essentially incorporated a judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court that created a new fundamental right .
- ( CS ) It is an important and perfectly legitimate aim to have clean vehicles , but today local authorities already have the option to include environmental considerations in contracts for public transport services .
That is an undeniable success for the Council under the French Presidency and I would like to thank you , Mr Jouyet , and pay tribute to the good work that you and your colleagues have done , in particular Mr Novelli .
What action is needed to resolve the terrible crisis that we are experiencing ?
I say this based on our experience of a common approach since 9/11 and with a view to the efficiency of the single market for aviation .
There is a lot on the ' to do ' list and I personally believe that healthy realism would be appropriate , because there are some on the team who are simply overloading the Council with too many topics - including psychologically difficult matters such as the poultry issue .
There are so many names which I could refer to at this point , but I would just like to mention Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev and George Bush senior .
I am quite confident that the Irish Government will come forward with a plan of how things should happen .
The rules for mobilising this fund need to be adapted to allow more flexible and timely mobilisation , addressing a wider range of disasters with significant impacts and reducing the time that elapses between the disaster and the point at which the funds are made available .
We will be providing the available regional funds to Wales and to all the other regions in future .
in writing . - I echo Adamos Adamou 's calls for policy action at EU level in the area of organ donation and transplantation .
The debate is closed .
Forty years on , sadly , little seems to have changed .
I suppose the reasons why that is the case are very complex and varied .
We have also placed a great deal of emphasis on SMEs and on vulnerable persons , especially the disabled .
As I say , hypocrisy apparently knows no bounds .
In about a week 's time the referendum on the Treaty will take place in Ireland .
What a regrettable situation !
The main basis of this legislative act is non - discrimination against agency workers in terms of payment , social and employee rights and applicable legislation .
This Parliament has repeatedly called on the Member States to devote far greater urgency to addressing the auditors ' concerns , and in particular , we have called on the Member States to meet the terms of the 2006 interinstitutional agreement .
I do not wish to discuss here the importance of rating agencies .
The Commission will also examine the regulatory framework on safety in nuclear power plants and by the end of the year will suggest any improvements that may prove to be necessary .
This money is not being spent on developing sustainable and competitive employment for the future .
Finally , I should like to welcome the work of EuroLat .
Mr President , The internal market is an extremely important part of the European cooperation , but for many consumers it is nothing more than a vague concept .
We welcome the overall trend towards liberalisation of the global trade in bananas , including the current WTO agreement , as well as bilateral agreements with the Central American and Andean countries , and possibly one day with Mercosur .
Second lesson : the 27 must concentrate on their budgetary policies very early on in proceedings .
Yes , the resolution is necessary and correct .
There has been no surge .
I saw the paperwork that has been heaped upon a particular producer because he is already within the ambit of these regulations .
I supported this important document .
Micro - businesses really need to be treated like family units and , in particular , the EU and its Member States need to work together to look at how small businesses can be given upfront support for energy efficiency improvements .
At times , we are tempted to believe that this is a phenomenon that takes place on the fringes of our society when , in reality , violence against women is carried out above all within the home .
Well , we must be thankful for small mercies .
Therefore the subsidy principle sometimes leads to a situation where some of the structural assistance is not used efficiently .
We must reduce bureaucracy and promote transparency in all areas of consumer rights .
( ES ) Madam President , I am also going to talk about Venezuela , because there are some people who do not understand that democracy is not just about casting votes .
It was the first time I have heard the names being called out in advance , when the number of speakers was limited , so that other Members who would not be able to speak could go about their business .
In terms of timing , it fits exactly in the current window , which we should use , because in the area of package travel , there is a whole range of issues when consumers are not properly informed about their rights .
First of all , when we speak of an intelligent car , we must not forget that a very important part of an intelligent car is an intelligent driver .
It is in his interests to polarise and divide public opinion in Poland and Europe .
While I welcome the readiness for dialogue , I must reiterate that this is not an attack on Hungary .
In exceptional cases , however , the EU may authorise the Member State to enter into bilateral agreements : if the Community has no interest in agreements with the third country , if the individual Member State has a particular interest in the agreement and the agreement does not negatively impact Community law .
Is the Commission taking the initiative going to be a question of weeks or a question of months ?
President Barroso has announced some policy guidelines on this matter to the European Parliament .
However , despite supporting the creation of a ' European Civil Protection Force ' as a ' centralised prevention and management instrument ' - a policy we disagree with - it states that this ' only makes sense on the basis of improved national civil protection schemes , and of better instruments for coordination between Member States ' , which in our opinion raises the question again as it should be raised .
Concentrating too much on this aspect will give the impression of an unjustified egocentricity on the part of Members of the European Parliament .
The one - minute speeches come in , we get allocated time but it is pathetic .
What we need are strategic solutions for the past but , above all , for the future .
More recently , at the end of Ataka 's European election campaign , a billboard displayed a banner stating : ' Baleva on the scaffold - the German Jew tied to the stake ! '
Whatever happened to the agreement being negotiated by Frontex with Turkey today ?
I have regularly attacked Mr McCreevy in the House on the issue of hedge funds and private equity .
I can tell you in advance that introducing contractual relations between industrial firms and farmers will , in the long term , result in those industries competing with each other , on a Europe - wide scale .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , President , first of all I would like to greet the president of the DTP Party , Mr Ahmet Türk , who is a VIP guest here to follow the debate .
We believe that all rights are residual in the individual .
One is country of origin .
I personally would like to go further still .
However , I am concerned by the fact that no clear decision has been made on the EU 's contribution and each Member State 's share of the total burden , taking into account each country 's ability to pay .
In the case of immediate exclusion , the urgency must be duly justified .
For this reason , in addition to current diplomatic activities , the European Union must continue its efforts to build the Palestinian infrastructure , with the training of security forces and reinforcement of the authority of the Palestinian administration .
How can we mediate for citizens in a dispute with their country without the country attending the Committee on Petitions ?
We note that the number of opium - free provinces in Afghanistan has more than doubled this year .
( PL ) It is with great pain that we observe what is going on in the Gaza strip .

I would therefore like to focus on two issues of particular importance in the retail area , our consideration of the framework for retail investment products , and our work on bank account mobility .
As such , it needs to assert its position and ensure that it is capable of meeting the mobility and transport requirements , increasing productivity , improving safety and benefiting the environment .
We need much more pressure .
Not only is President Sarkozy going to the Olympic Games , but also , on 16 June , broadcasts by a group that broadcast into China via Eutelsat , with the permission of the French authorities , were suspended .
Therefore , voting will be held on this matter tomorrow .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I will concentrate on the report on anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay and our group 's view on this matter .
We know who the additional ringleaders that need to be targeted are , we know who the henchmen are , who the bag carriers are .

in writing . - ( RO ) There is absolutely no question that in the interest of the safety and health of all European citizens , the EU and Member States must give top priority to the decommissioning of the relevant nuclear power plants in the new Member States .
We will also include measures for integrated maritime surveillance , and we will have private - sector involvement because , with regard to maritime issues , I believe this to be absolutely necessary .
( PT ) At the Summit , Europe spoke clearly about how China is perverting WTO rules , failing to respect workers ' rights , exporting products that are harmful to health , pirating technology and impeding European access to the Chinese market .
The US president confirmed that the path ahead of us will be long , requiring more realism than naivety , and that nothing is more important than concrete , feasible steps .
In my opinion , in addition to these pillars , we need to put emphasis on cooperation between both Member and non - Member States of the European Union in the Danube river basin .
The Commission must not stop there , however .
This is the case for environmental and public health reasons , due to the high levels of pollution associated with it , and for energy reasons related to dwindling oil reserves and growing difficulty of access to this commodity .
Anyone who does not agree does not deserve to hear the laughter of children .
These figures do not take into account the European Agency for Reconstruction , which was closed in 2008 , and on the last discharge of which we will vote today , or rather at a later date in Brussels .
I believe that all this will help to create a robust international investment policy in the European Union .
Just think of the Water Directive , the Groundwater Directive , the Nitrates Directive , the 18 Directives relating to cross - compliance .
However , the goal of our demographically ageing society cannot be to spend many years exchanging every second lat earned into euros to pay back the banks , while in the evenings , offering up prayers that the lat will hold fast against the euro .
That is why I am confident that if we , as Parliaments , are more involved in the implementation of this strategy in the future , we will be able to deliver added value to this partnership .
The vote will take place tomorrow , 31.1.2008 .

What is especially worrying about the Council 's cuts has been the fact that they are targeted , among other things , at research and development , as mentioned previously .
I agree with Mrs Fajon that ordinary people from this area should not be hostages to the current political situation but , at the same time , it is necessary to formulate the decision on free movement for Kosovars clearly in such a way that their leaders do not begin to interpret it erroneously as a de facto recognition of their declaration of statehood .
Like the Mongols of Outer Mongolia , the Uyghurs or the Turkmen people of Xinjiang , Tibet is suffering this oppression that seeks to destroy its identity .

on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( EL ) Mr President , we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left do not wish to enter into the spirit of celebration , because we know full well that social Europe is not one of the Commission 's or the Council 's priorities .

I intend to make this a regular feature of the European Council meetings .
Here I shall quote the Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , Martin Schulz : ' Europe cannot successfully compete with other regions of the world on low wages and social standards , but on technological innovations , higher quality of work and the competence and knowledge of its people .

It is through these organisations that consumers gain strength and acquire more knowledge and information .
However , I believe that , in this respect , the investment should be made in the fields of solar energy and carbon capture and storage .
However , more specifically let me say that the proposed ad hoc instrument to which I will come to soon will be designed in such a way as to set criteria that are needs - based and do not follow the EFF so that , for example , the requirements of those who have already undertaken substantial restructurings are recognised and that those who have low EFF allocations are also recognised .

Mrs Lulling asked a very specific question .
The EIT would seem a splendid project , therefore - if it were not for the inadequate financial arrangements .
Monocultures , the felling of rainforests and competition with food and feed crops , which has contributed to the current food crisis , have seemingly prompted the EU ministers to think again and have dealt a blow to their target of increasing the share of renewables in the production of motor fuel to 10 % by 2020 .

Biogas is an important renewable energy resource which contributes to sustainable agricultural development and improves the state of the environment .

, in writing . - The Irish Government 's Jobs Initiative has correctly concentrated on the jobs - rich sector of tourism ; while the EU 's Small Business Act has the potential to complement this in the area of SMEs over the coming years .

Of the 15 old Member States , the per capita debt of the population in 12 Member States exceeds EUR 16 000 , which accounts for 90 % of the average annual family income .

Both of these areas are currently under threat in the media sector .
I would ask you if , in your concluding comments , you could address some of those very real issues , so that people realise that they are being discussed .

Closure of the sitting
There is only one requirement to be met before the Council can take a decision , which is planned for December 2007 , on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the new Member States .
Mr Kelly , from a strictly legal point of view , the Treaty of Lisbon brings with it a change , in that it deems tourism to be a third - level competence of the Community , in other words , the Community may act to supplement the activities of the Member States but cannot put forward any harmonising legislation in this field .
That is why I tabled amendments to that effect , which were adopted by the Committee on Culture and Education .

With this in mind , a fundamental revision of the Procedures Directive is absolutely vital , so as to provide an accessible , fair and effective procedure , as much in the interests of asylum seekers as in those of the Member States .
I look forward to your debate .
The whole of this discussion has taken place as if the euro were of no global importance .
So while we endorse the long term goals , we cannot endorse the means and have voted against those reports which do not confine themselves to the eurozone .
This would still be supporting the European Parliament , which expressed itself here in the debate and in the vote that took place on the report , for which I had the honour to be the rapporteur , on the EU 's negotiations with Mercosur , which was adopted a year ago , and to which I refer .
My third question concerns pension funds .

I would like to thank the EGF for providing assistance which is selected very carefully and is socially responsible .
On the other hand , we know very well that it needs nuclear energy to make the bomb .
The first is that there is no mathematical link between the length of maternity leave and women 's fertility rate , and to prove it I need only mention the situation in France , since France is a country which provides for 14 weeks ' maternity leave and which , today , has one of the highest birth rates in Europe .
The key question that this report attempts to answer is the following : how can we strengthen and effectively implement the European policy of regional cooperation in the Black Sea region in order to achieve the objective of creating a common space of security , democracy and prosperity ?

The report moreover provides an all - round approach to tourism in the coastal regions as it includes issues such as the marine and coastal environments , sea transport , employment in the coastal regions , support for small and medium - sized enterprises and support for fishing .
It is true that it promotes the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons and the control of all weapons .
Fishing bosses no longer want to invest in their boats so the fleet is ageing .
We want a global agreement and we also want to include in it flights from third countries .
In this context , the alternative to Russian gas , the Nabucco project , becomes an absolute necessity .
We have had our battles along the way , but most of the time we have fought together in the spirit of cooperation which pervades work in the Committee on Budgets .

With regard to the resolution on the Commission 's enlargement strategy paper for 2009 , we would like to make it clear , on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , that the fact that we supported it overall does not in any way mean that we agree with the recognition of Kosovo as an independent State .
Furthermore , we are allowing our supply businesses , hard hit , as they have been , by the economic crisis , a sufficient transitional period to get to grips with the high level of requirements made of them .
The agreement on CO 2 emissions from cars is a bow to the car industry and it only serves to confirm that the EU 's promises in relation to climate change are not worth the paper they are written on .

I fully agree that this is a completely different debate but we have an allocated time of two minutes , so I am free to give time to two people .
It is simply paying our respects to the victims of a totalitarian system .
That runs contrary to a unanimous decision adopted in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
Perhaps it should also be said that those who expected the European Parliament to announce an end to EU enlargement and to introduce some substitute for full accession have been disappointed .
This resolution only goes as far as calling on the Commission and the Council ' to take all necessary steps to ensure a level playing field ' .
In recent years , we have had a rapid increase in energy prices and the European citizens are expecting an answer to their problems from the European institutions .

Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaties have been invoked here today .

I turn now most importantly , if I may say so , to the oral question that you put and which clearly poses the whole problem of PNR .
The complaint made by the environmental lobby that the package has been watered down frankly seems unreasonable to me , when we consider that targets are being observed and industrial sectors have a declining emissions ceiling .
This means channelling our aid , preferably as budget support ( provided that the basic criteria are fulfilled ) .
We need a common strategy focused on prevention through education that expands information policies , increases family planning efforts and facilitates access to contraception .
In this way , the billions of euro will be applied , firstly , as intended ; secondly , in compliance with deadlines ; and , thirdly , in the interests of citizens , and not in the interests of individual civil servants and political groupings .
However , for the Court to be credible , it must really be very scrupulous , because the Court is saying , today , that it is glad the glass is 95 % full , while I think many taxpayers will ask : ' but why is it 5 % empty ? '
in writing . - This report , adopted unanimously in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , is some kind of contribution by Parliament to the revision of Directive 2001/95 / EC on general product safety .

This is the only way we can support women and oppose society 's acceptance of domestic violence and the impunity of those who commit this crime .
That is why I believe it is important , Commissioner , that your strategy addresses these challenges efficiently and effectively and provides responses .
Neither can it be verified theoretically .
This agreement removes that barrier through the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to Schengen .
For example , I was the rapporteur recently on the Waste Framework Directive .
With great cynicism , his Commission has sent employees of the Commission into schools all over Ireland in recent days to speak , supposedly , of how good the Commission of the European Union is - in reality a signal to their parents that they should vote ' yes ' for Lisbon .
Checks on food will be made even more difficult because large multinationals are using monopolies to hide behind in order to avoid any responsibility while carrying on activities that are dangerous and very damaging to public health .
Perhaps you think I am naive , but I am not alone .
It is noteworthy that on this occasion , in marked contrast to the madness of the nearby Burmese regime , China is showing an openness to assistance and international aid .
At masters level , they can approach interdisciplinary knowledge about the economy in a developing world with flexibility , while at doctoral level , they provide innovative solutions .
A good and effective system of scientific research management at European level is therefore essential .
I think that it is our duty to prevent the loss of human life .
The most important factor of a control system applied to 27 Member States is probably that all stakeholders should be treated equally and , in particular , that everyone along the production chain - fishermen , middlemen , buyers , people who have links to recreational fishing and others - should feel that they are not being discriminated against but also that they have their share of the responsibility on this matter .
I believe also that we should lift the ban on the People 's Mujahedin , and we should do that as soon as possible .
After this , the government set up an independent committee , whose reports are available on a wide range of websites , including in English . This committee made suggestions and numerous court proceedings were also initiated .
It is good and important for us to make progress in this area .
However , Europe is at a turning point if it does not find a new modus operandi . The events of the past weeks with regard to the Greek crisis - and here I would disagree with Mr Gauzès , since unfortunately , the European Union and the Member States , and especially Mrs Merkel , have been late in responding to this situation - mean that Europe is at a turning point .
The issue of equal opportunities must be resolved , and we have to make progress in this respect , as well , but not in this directive .
The obligation to consult the Schengen Information Service during the processing of requests for long - stay visas is the same procedure as the one which already exists for nationals of third countries who are holders of residence permits .
Disputes over competence must be resolved in accordance with the principle of equality and the principle of cooperation .
in writing . - ( RO ) The new directive is a balanced agreement offering benefits such as the right recognised at EU level of consumers to change their mind in the two weeks after they have received the item they ordered and the obligation for online traders to provide full information about the total price and the trader 's contact details .
Creating more and better jobs is in our hands .
Today in Europe 54 % of all aircraft ramp inspections concern European operators .
Farmers should not therefore fear this limit , because it will oblige the processing industry to locate itself nearer the places where the animals have been reared .
Moving to the question raised about transparency , the Commission is about to launch a web portal that should start to operate around May - June 2008 on the question of broadband and the citizens .
Road safety : stands for two - wheel motor vehicles ( vote )
Of course , we would like to have the new Treaty approved as soon as possible .
Mr Booth , this is not a fiasco .
This is not the case with just one area .
I agree with the very important call for the international community , as well as the EU , to make a firm and long - term commitment to immediately make good all their promises , because more than a million people are living in what were supposed to be temporary makeshift camps and human rights organisations report that living conditions in these camps without facilities are terrible and women ' face the risk of rape and sexual violence ' .
Some of them sell online , some travel to another country for services , and sometimes the service provider visits the customer 's home country .
We had problems with certain Member States .
One of the long - term tasks of this strategy has been to promote sustainable development , but we have not been able to achieve this .
I very much hope , however , that the amendments to reject the Commission 's entire proposal will not gain a majority tomorrow .
It is important that citizens should be able to monitor proceedings that are of interest to them and access all documents from one location .
I thought that you wanted to put an item on the agenda .
Clearly give references to documents .
However , we know only too well today that , on issues such as cabotage , social conditions in the various countries are such that , were it to be systematised , we could , as things stand , see a number of workers from countries with high levels of pay ejected , ousted from the market by countries with low levels of pay .
According to international law , these persons must be escorted to the nearest port , and as VicePresident Barrot said at the time of the first incident , the closest port of call in this case is that of Lampedusa .
The report asked for reform of international aid , elimination of opium poppy cultivation , better coordination of police training , and support for the peace process .
The Hungarian Presidency will do everything in its power to this end .
The debate is closed .
I voted for this regulation because I consider that it is a welcome improvement to a previous measure which restricted the rights of long - stay visa holders in a Member State .
There is no point in going over the context of this resolution , it was totally obvious .
This decision of Moody 's seems inconsistent with the evolution of Greek sovereign bond deals and CDS spreads , which have narrowed significantly since the agreement on the programme .
We must now ensure that this is recognised as a right for all seafarers and have employers finance it .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149(8 ) )
I would like to assure you that the Presidency will pay great attention to this issue and will keep you fully informed of the outcome of further discussions in the Council , as well as any other developments .
This is a serious matter .
This technology is based on developments in genetics going back a good half - century .
I was happy to back the report by Heide Rühle calling for a simplification of public procurement .
Successes like the invention by the Romanian Raluca - Ioana van Stade , which is a sensor that can determine the presence of cancer in the human body at molecular level , directly from a person 's blood , using a simple procedure lasting less than six minutes , must be supported and capitalised on to the full .
The major problem with the European energy strategy is that it was not built from scratch , but is rooted in each country 's own geography , history and energy economics .
We cannot talk in generalised terms about the overcapacity or the overfishing or the lack of compliance .
Baroness Ashton ran CND and still refuses to tell us whether she took money from the Communist Party of Great Britain .
Wine , wheat , peace !
Finally , I wish to thank in particular the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency for their excellent work .
Wall Street and City survivors are speculating on the currency markets and short selling CDSs that they do not even have .
What is the situation going to be when increased discharges from the incineration plant will be allowed into the atmosphere ?
This was done in a responsible manner too , which means that it provides the highest possible level of safety for consumers .
In other words : the best policy with regard to the Arctic would be for the EU to get involved on the sidelines only .
Any doubters can look at the policy of the centre - right government in my home country , Sweden , if I can be allowed to be a little patriotic at the end of this debate .
Much more needs to be done , given that 40 % of the world 's most undernourished children live in India .
People fresh from the tragedy of Aquila , but here we had the navy , we had the fire fighters , we had NGOs , we had civilians , we had doctors , we had psychiatrists , we had dentists , we had nurses , all working under the umbrella of the commander , actually , of the ship who had a hospital ship full of people who were being treated from the direct consequences of the earthquake .
We are voting against the EU 's proposals for a ' health check ' of the CAP.
We must therefore better define the operational structure of the institutions of the Union for the Mediterranean , providing the secretariat with financial resources and with criteria for membership and for implementing projects .
in writing . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is not done with disowning hyper - President Sarkozy : rejection of the proposals on fuel tax , warnings against the budgetary slides and , now , transformation of the proposed Union for the Mediterranean into a re - launch of the Barcelona Process , which has been a failure for more than 10 years .
It damages confidence when a government subjects its banks to a stress test in the summer and only a few months later realises that it was really a stress test for the euro and not for the banks .
If I am mistaken , I would be very grateful for a written reply on the suitability or inadequacy of the scheme I have proposed .
I hope that you can confirm this again today .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the sole objective of this report and today 's discussions is simply to conceal a glaring reality in the European Union : industry is in crisis and the damage being caused is substantial .
That is what I understand the Innovation Union is offering .
Democracies can be built with extremely diverse parties .
You have already heard from two members of my group who have differing views on this and I think you will see tomorrow that the position of our group will be against this - unless some of the amendments that my colleagues have proposed are voted through .
Along with others , I voted for the amendments limiting the directive to 67 airports ( compared to around 150 which would have been affected before ) .
Therefore , Mr Orbán , I hope that the good European - ness in you continues to develop positively and that there will also be positive Hungarian - ness in you .
I voted in favour of this report because I join the chorus of disappointment in Parliament at the European Union 's lack of a genuinely global and uniform post - Lisbon approach to the common security policy .
This creates unequal conditions for the new Member States and discriminates against them .
However , I fear that the author is on the wrong track with her plans to achieve this goal of cost reduction by introducing numerous additional provisions .
Only EU fruit is to be provided , for example bananas from remote regions .
Unfortunately , it provides almost no development support for either of the two states .
In this Union of free movement , the only remaining barriers are those of our political debates .
The way the report has now been drawn up provides good conditions for achieving these goals .
Finally , I should like to ask the Commission why Mr Ganley 's campaign in Ireland produced better results than the campaign undertaken by the Irish Government and the European Union regarding the Lisbon Treaty ?
Circumstances are changing constantly , however , and due to the unrest and wars in North Africa , Europe 's southern borders are now under increased pressure from thousands of refugees .
As part of efforts to promote and highlight European culture , in 2007 , the European Union adopted the Culture Programme which will run until 2013 .
We call upon the Heads of State or Government who are meeting this evening to prepare for the G 20 to place the issue of the dairy crisis on the agenda for their meeting , so that appropriate steps can be taken to respond to livestock farmers .
Everyone is free to make their own choice .
I would ask Commissioner Špidla if this amendment can apply from 1 May 2009 , provided that tomorrow we have the large majority needed to adopt this proposal at first reading .
What is needed is not complaints , however , but effective cooperation to tackle the current crisis in a constructive and far - sighted manner .
To start with , a joint action to combat trafficking in human beings was adopted in 1997 .
The deleted text read as follows :
In Poland , for example , there has been an increase in VAT which means that the cost of family maintenance has gone up .
It should also be underlined that the restructuring plans submitted on 12 September - and I am talking about the plans of the Polish Government - foresee job reductions of approximately 40 % .
I can say , on this subject , that the European Union is working on such preventive measures .
We cannot afford to compromise here .
On the other hand - and you also referred to the legal position - are we in the European Union really justified in arrogating legislative or contractual powers to ourselves on every issue that deeply concerns anyone in the EU ?
Now , regarding the future President of the Council , I am not going to comment .
An excellent opportunity will present itself next week at the informal meeting of heads of state and government with the US President in Prague .
We will continue the assistance that is already ongoing , notably in the fields of human rights , education and poverty eradication .
As such , we are not aiming in every direction , but instead wish to focus our attention on this issue .
The approximation will continue in 2012 and 2015 .
Nevertheless , those who take a more fundamentalist view are entitled to be reassured that ' organic ' really is organic , and not just a label used to extract a price premium from gullible and ill - informed consumers .
We have included in our resolution a whole list of people whom , I believe , Lady Ashton must mention whenever she has the opportunity .
In the rapporteur 's view , the objectives of the new regulation on novel foods are to attain a high level of food safety , consumer protection , environmental protection and protection of animal health , while at all times observing the precautionary principle , as laid down in Regulation ( EC ) No 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law , establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety .
For this reason , Mr President , and for other reasons which I shall mention in my second speech , it is worth us granting the visa exemption to Taiwan , as the United Kingdom and Ireland did last year .
Now that is being realistic .
If asked how the crisis is affecting their economies , developing countries reply that it has brought a downturn in trade leading to lower economic growth , restrictions on output and higher levels of unemployment .
I call on the political forces within the country to guarantee political order and stability following the elections .
Firstly , I should be happier if those Members who delivered impassioned speeches for the whole world to hear would at least stay in the chamber for the rest of the debate .
There is a consensus on how to assess the anthropogenic influence ; that is covered in Article 3 .
It is our political and moral duty to support the people of Georgia and to make Russia understand that the time when it could act at will in its self - proclaimed sphere of influence has gone forever .
I have no intention of reprising the arguments we have just heard from my three honourable friends : it makes no economic sense ; it makes no technical sense ; we are getting free use of the American GPS .
I have said that on these questions Mr Gollnisch has asked for a point of order .
The third point is , of course , safety , and safety certification has to be a prerequisite for obtaining a licence to operate .
This is why European institutions must promote new dynamic labour market policies as soon as possible .
We would have liked to have seen a few different figures in parts of the agriculture budget .
Our target group for this information is quite different , after all - it is not those who already have an excellent knowledge of how healthy different foods are .
We need that information .
I would like to express my sincere thanks to her .
Thus , it is in our interest to ensure that immigration takes place legally , under regulated circumstances , and that Member States have the possibility to monitor the process , while immigrants experience legal certainty , meaning that there should be no advantages to be gained from circumventing legal procedures .
In addition , the EU has important experiences to share when it comes to overcoming conflict and building stability through shared interest and mutual understanding .
On one side it is a direct neighbour of the European Union and , on the other , Ukraine could be an important bridge between the EU , Russia and the countries of Central Asia .
I look to the day that we will work , not only for greater equality in the workplace , but to empower women to make a free choice and to feel strong enough to achieve their goals .
President in Office . - ( SL ) Thank you , Mr Rack , for this additional question .
These are mainly points indicating the need to protect children and youths from negative advertising .
Member of the Commission . - Reports by the WTO and the Commission 's own monitoring show that there is no imminent risk of a generalised protectionist escalation .
25 .
The routines of agriculture are not determined by fixed hours but have to adjust to seasonal requirements , vegetative periods and the possible presence of livestock .
In conclusion , Mr President , I should like to believe that compromises will be reached regarding the few points still to be clarified , enabling us to go ahead with the vote in Strasbourg .
Furthermore , it is regrettable that the Commission has not acted upon the recommendations of Parliament , the Council of Europe , the Commissioner , and the OSCE for example , on the violation of the principle of confidentiality of journalistic sources , extremely disproportionate sanctions , and abolishing the political and financial independence of public service broadcast media .
It is a question of the future of our children , which means our future .
Continuing with old programmes and designing new programmes has to be given in - depth scrutiny .
15 .
It must not slip to number two as a result of the current economic difficulties .
Let me go straight to the point .
The rule is that , if the author is absent , the question lapses .
I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Guido Sacconi , for the important contribution which he made in achieving the agreement and I trust that you will support the compromise agreement in the vote tomorrow .
These agreements should ensure that the determination to fight terrorism and criminality will not call into question the protection of civil liberties and fundamental rights , not least the rights to privacy , informational self - determination and data protection .
On these points , in fact , by creating opportunities for one group of people , it restricts the opportunities of another group .
If there are difficulties in implementing the operational programmes of each Member State , then these should be overcome ( including by increasing the Community co - financing rates ) .
It is , however , the crisis that prompts this urgent intervention .
We need diverse impact assessment , drawing on a broad range of policy options and focusing on the practical issues that are important for the operation of an optional instrument .
The Committee on Budgets has created a special reserve to boost activity - based management .
It is the Commission which has the right of initiative , and it is the Commission who must now come forward with a real package .
Greece 's situation is not unique ; the EU will have to face other similar shock effects .
They cover CO 2 efficiency , biodiversity , but also social criteria .
Hugo Chávez got to where he is today partly because we have helped him through our foreign policy omissions and commissions .
Finally , the Stockholm Programme will bring safety and security to Europe 's citizens , and it is extremely important that we get this programme in place .
Evgeni Kirilov 's report on the Cohesion Policy and investments in the real economy underlines the importance of these features common to Member States as a first requirement in the common strategy for pursuing social and economic policies .
' Enter into constructive talks ' with ' Continue the constructive talks ' .
All this would make Strasbourg more attractive because it is a beautiful city .
When European citizens use Twitter , they express their consent to Twitter 's privacy policy .
I believe it is essential for public servants to be answerable to the public , which is why they must give objective and detailed accounts of how the public funds made available to them have been used .
Improving and strengthening the European judicial area also means improving and modernising the way in which justice works , which in turn depends on our using new methods of communication ; this is the essence of the e-justice project .
Instead of taking this into account , Europe is making Iran the solution to the problems of the Middle East , when it is actually the main problem .
- ( LT ) I have a question , Commissioner .
Europe must learn from the nuclear incidents in Japan and undertake to guarantee nuclear safety across the continent .
Pesticides are essential for growing food , and they are already subject to a stringent safety regime .
In other words , the European Union makes a decision and therefore proposes that the Member States act in that way .
An example , of course , is the Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi , who led the National League for Democracy to victory in elections held 18 years ago and has spent 12 years in detention - and recently the junta decided to further extend the period of her house arrest .
It is important that we spend subsidies to facilitate mine closures properly : to ensure that the employees concerned are retrained and redeployed in other sectors of the labour market .
At the moment there are 27 different regimes and approaches to solving this problem and , of course , we have no illusions that such a complicated question can be resolved in such a short time .
Ultimately , it is not abuses of flags of convenience that we need to combat , but the very existence of this practice .
( PT ) Madam President , it is important for everyone to join in the fight against trafficking in human beings , with a view to eradicating it .
Finally , European - level foundations like this can ensure an efficient financial framework for cooperation between national political foundations and teachers at European level , including other representatives of youth organisations and civil society .
It was not the first demonstration in which this social group had expressed its discontent .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the President of the Council and thank the Chairman of the Committee , Mr Deprez , for his introduction .
Such reforms are welcomed both by the EU and by the citizens of Turkey .
I would like to highlight two specific issues : first , public funding .
The losers will be the workers , the artists and human evolution itself because , under coercion from the multinationals , the overwhelming majority of players and performers are obliged to assign all their rights to them in return for a pittance .
We can no longer prevent it , but we can hope and strive to control it .
A genuine integration of the Roma into our society would be actual proof of the fact that the cornerstones of democracy , the rule of law and human rights still form the basis of the European Community .
I support the implementation of the new European Investment Bank package which will provide EUR 30 billion , earmarked for loans to SMEs .
( ES ) Mr President , the United Nations regards trafficking in persons as incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human being ; nonetheless , every year over half a million people are victims of trafficking , of whom 80 % are women and girls , half are minors and the majority are prisoners of sexual exploitation .
That being the case , the Commission 's role and also our role as Parliament - and , incidentally , the role of the Euro - Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly as well - is a special role .
The main priority is the buildings in Eastern Europe .
The objective of the Commission proposal being debated today is to revise the basic legal framework governing the production of statistics at European level .
We want security to be in place ; however , we also want consumers to know how much they are paying for what .
In addition , the rights of underage players must be safeguarded effectively at all times .
In the past , ENISA was harshly criticised .
However , if we impose disproportionate constraints - particularly in relation to traceability - on operators who place timber on the market , this will result in our businesses becoming less competitive without for all that reducing instances of illegal logging , which will be redirected to other markets .
Data in the fisheries sector and scientific advice regarding the common fisheries policy ( vote )
Every effort must be made to establish their fate and help bring them safely back to their loved ones .
China is still terrorised by the Chinese Communist Party after 61 years of power .
That must change , as we lead the world on these issues .
There must be stronger political engagement by the host governments , and stronger coherence among donors , including internally among Member States .
It beggars belief that today , we are discussing a topic that has been on the agenda since 1957 , no less , when the equal treatment of men and women , equal pay for men and women were anchored in the Treaties .
in writing . - Early learning in the EU follows a long and finely differentiated tradition in the different Member States .
If the Commission really meant that , it would not present us with a framework directive , which accords the Member States the greatest possible self - determination in the definition of goals for soil protection .
These payments will be quicker and more flexible and there will only be a single payment , which will enable the required projects to be implemented in a short time in areas such as infrastructure , energy or the environment .
They see an EU - Canada agreement as a vehicle to force extensive privatisation in areas like public transport , water provision and electricity .
Georgia was brutally attacked in August 2008 by the armies of the Russian Federation and , besides suffering damage on a large scale and numerous fatalities , has also experienced a serious deterioration of its economic condition .
However , in our view car manufacturers should be given the opportunity to choose themselves how they wish to meet the environmental targets set by us politicians .
Acts done at EU level should be ambitious and in keeping with the scientific reality of our times .
I therefore considered that this report , aimed at simplifying the way in which funds are granted for research , development and innovation via the Seventh Framework Programme , deserves to be supported .
Financial , energy and political security , as well as the consolidation of the European project 's basic values , can only be guaranteed through a close partnership with our neighbours .
Unfortunately clouds are gathering over the EU 's future : the paradoxical Irish vote ( Ireland having become the ' Celtic Tiger ' that we know thanks to EU funds ) , the government crisis in Austria , the statements of the Polish President , are all worrying signs .
There are concerns that the financial services and insurance industries in the European Union are less efficient than they should be , and consequently EU industry faces higher costs for financial services and insurance than its competitors in third countries .
I therefore call on the players in Bosnia and Herzegovina to adopt the anti - corruption act and lay down rules for the exchange of information between the different parts of the police service as quickly as possible .
As a result of the debates held over the last few months , we voted in favour of creating BERT , which would simplify cooperation by the national regulatory authorities and would guarantee actual participation .
Why should they have to examine their entire country and define risk areas , even though they already have exemplary legislation ?
I am very grateful to Commissioner Šemeta for the fact that the Commission , under his leadership , has now , for the first time , carried out a consultation amongst subsidy recipients on the subject of ' Obstacles and difficulties in the application procedure ' .
Hopefully , this will bring pressure on the Chinese Government to rethink actions like the arrest of Hu Jia .
( HU ) Ethnic discrimination is clearly prohibited by EU and international law .
In the light of the French presidency 's objective of establishing a governance process for the European Research Area ( ERA ) by the end of 2009 , could the Commission specify what measures it plans undertaking , in cooperation with Member States and Parliament , to put in place science policy evaluation methodologies to ensure evidence - based policy options for science and research and development in the EU ?
I believe that you are laying yourself open to a real risk , and not just to public health .
The neverending story is now becoming reality .
Thousands of survivors , if not more , are being put up in military camps for the time being .
The commitment of the business community is equally important , with self - regulation a key to success .
I support the Commission proposal to phase out State aid in 2014 for the pits which are not competitive by that date .
The Stockholm Programme has not been consigned to the museum .
And so the Irish are forced to have yet another referendum so they can deliver the only answer that is acceptable to the European Union - which is ' yes ' .
This , then , is another element to be taken into account .
We need an integrated European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development which is based on defending productive sectors and public investment , by effectively boosting Community funds to support countries with weaker economies , which respects nature and creates jobs with rights , and which promotes public services , increases purchasing power and ensures a fair distribution of income to reduce poverty .
Let us trust that people who can vote for us are also sufficiently capable of choosing the right foodstuff in the shops if provided with the appropriate information .
All the same we hope that at some point there will be some movement on the question of the negotiating mandate for the new partnership and cooperation agreement .
It is through respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms that a democratic regime can ultimately be recognised .
Whether this package will be a good birthday present remains to be seen .
Building new houses and renovating existing ones , improving access to utilities , as well as education , healthcare and jobs , are viable solutions for enabling us to achieve our objective .
Mr President , I should like to draw your attention to the huge opportunity afforded by innovation partnerships for the sorely needed economic and social development of the European Union , and to the serious risk which exists , in that incorrect use of this tool could increase the innovation and research divide between the Member States of the European Union still further .
Nonetheless , the Union 's role as a coordinator and promoter makes a significant contribution to presenting Europe as a very attractive and diverse tourist destination .
Therefore , the Commission considers it crucial to examine how to deal with macro - financial assistance in the future , notably within the framework of the Lisbon Treaty .
The problem is nothing to do with stress testing one incident .
( HU ) Mr President , I cannot emphasis enough that European engineers and developers have carried out outstanding work and , as the Vice - President announced , we are awaiting the launch of Giove - B.
I too am extremely satisfied with the outcome of this debate .
That is particularly true , as a number of honourable Members have said , in Kosovo , where I have met the government .
Allow me to give you a few examples : first of all , the failure to spend the cohesion funds , the impossibility of executing the pilot projects we hold dear , such as the Erasmus - style programme for apprentices , the lack of transparency in the choices of research firms , the poor implementation of selection competitions for new officials .
This is especially visible in third countries .
We are extremely concerned , first of all by the humanitarian situation in Burma , and secondly about the responsibility of the Burmese authorities for countering the effects of the disastrous cyclone , and in this context about their responsibility for securing access so that the humanitarian aid can reach those who need it .
The role of NATO was mentioned in several speeches .
Mr President , it is good that the EU is trying to preserve endangered fish stocks , but before there is too much self - congratulation on these proposals , we must remember that many past EU fishing rules have been appalling failures .
Just as Mr Juncker stated to Parliament in his speech , the euro is very definitely an ' anchor of stability ' .
The refurbishment of power stations currently in operation may also be of key significance .
Those are the questions that we need to answer and I think that now more than ever it is at last time for Europe to get back to politics .
At the same time , we also tried to promote the interests of consumers by reinforcing implementing measures on , for example , marketing and monitoring , supporting the exclusion of cloned animals from the food chain , and specific labelling provisions .
Let me also voice our hope that it will continue to do so in future , enabling aid to be dispensed effectively at the point of need .
Emotionally , this situation is extremely important to Greeks .
The directive only extends the application of that which already exists , so it does not in any way involve more bureaucracy .
However , at the same time , better information must be provided to citizens through appropriate information campaigns and campaigns for promoting voluntary labels for other production methods which respect the environment and animals , such as ' integrated production ' , ' outdoor grazing ' and ' hill farming ' .
Member of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , may I sum up once again : it was an extremely interesting debate and we all very clearly see the need to respond to this .
That is a political achievement on an issue that was not on the European agenda until two years ago and it is , therefore , also a response to those who were aware of the need for practical results .
According to the Commission 's proposal , the conditions and procedure for granting status will become simpler and clearer in the European Union .
We all know why : linguistic problems , justified apprehension about the risks , uncertainty about the tax arrangements , etc.
These accompanying measures are justified by the reduction in tariff preferences granted to the ACP countries following the conclusion , in December 2009 , of the Geneva Agreement with the United States and the countries of Latin America .
It is important to bear in mind , however , that its effectiveness depends solely on the exchange of data with the US being entirely reciprocal .
I think that would be a better approach to take .
in writing . - I voted for this report which states that one of the key challenges in relaunching the Single Market is ensuring political leadership , commitment and coordination .
In this case , we have chosen to support the original proposals as a counterbalance to the disagreeable tendencies in this Parliament .
This is why it would have been wise to confine ourselves here to minimal harmonisation instead of trying to harmonise as much as possible .
I have received the following nomination : Mr László Tőkés .
I would also like to comment on the problem of the lowest price .
The view of the Member States that not everything can be solved at European level is a blatant error .
It is wonderful that Slovenia has the Presidency .
I therefore believe that the ball is now in the court of the Member States ' authorities .
Although the progress towards a completed democratic transition varies from country to country - in Belarus there have been only minor advances , while in Ukraine and Georgia , some significant steps have been taken - the European Union should always sustain the possibility for the Eastern Neighbourhood countries to accede to the EU , since the efforts to establish functional democracy , rule of law and respect of human rights can sometimes be exhausting to the point of relapse .
What , then , was I trying to do ?
As the rapporteur mentions , the very purpose of advertising is to influence each and every one of us - women and men alike .
We need only look at the sums spent by the tobacco industry on advertising to understand the enormity of the challenge we face .
In fact , productivity in the manufacturing sector in Europe is going through difficult times , while emerging countries are not only growing but also investing heavily in research and technology .
Europe must not only drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions ; it must also adapt to global warming .
It is to be welcomed that the use of biometric data in passports and travel documents will become subject to stricter rules and harmonisation , especially since the abolition of Europe 's internal borders has demonstrated the need for reinforced safety controls at the external borders .
The monitoring of this measure would require much more time , and potentially also more staff , unpacking of items and other procedures .
Firstly , because of competition within the Union in the internal market ; in other words , it must not be possible for one country to derive a competitive advantage as a result of the neglect of animals .
It highlights , in particular , how important it is for the European Parliament and for the Council to pay attention to compliance with the charter throughout the legislative process .
For others more prone to sermonising , this amounts to saying that ' we Europeans must give lessons on how to protect these poor Africans from the Chinese ' .
However , we know from our experience of World Bank and International Monetary Fund programmes - and what we are currently seeing in Ireland is not so very different from this - that in the end , these countries have no choice .
Fellow Members , please understand once and for all that Turkey is a country which , less than 100 years ago , committed genocide against the peoples within its borders and peoples which had recently liberated themselves from Turkish rule .
Not to do more on energy efficiency would , in any case , be crazy . Energy efficiency means economic efficiency .
Prevention and awareness - raising must be improved and social rights to support victims must be strengthened .
This will provide a higher rate of growth and increased employment .
Let me repeat : I believe that the European Union is uniquely placed to lead in building this future , precisely because we have proved over the last 60 years that we as Europe can meet and master the challenges of cooperation across borders , of coordination between peoples , and of building unity out of diversity .
In other words , we reduce the habitats of birds and other animals . The future common agricultural policy must reconcile biodiversity with agricultural subsidies .
However , this is an interesting question .
I am more than willing , however , to discuss the matter with the competent Commissioner and to ensure that you get an answer as quickly as possible to the question as to whether the Commission has any plans in this respect .
The report welcomes the fact that Parliament will have more influence on the EU 's legislative work .
The matter is urgent .
Eurosceptics have always been represented in this Parliament , well represented , have almost always had a political group and I am sure that will continue to be the case .
Mr President , freedom of expression and an independent media are the cornerstone of democracy and they have to be valued highly and protected .
By any understanding of the financing of the development of rural areas , confidence is being destroyed here and structural interruptions provoked .
On top of that , there is strong competition for attracting and keeping the most talented researchers .
Mr President , if the European Union were a car , this Treaty would be about tuning that vehicle .
While there may well be good points in it , it eventually went too far .
The situation has now changed dramatically .
On financial regulation , the European Union wants to move the frontier further : no financial product , no institution , no market , no jurisdiction should be exempt from regulation .
Madam President , whilst the term ' greening ' of Pillar One may appeal to armchair farmers , it will pose major problems to heavy - land farmers who could well abandon land rather than attempt to plant it in the spring .

Governments in the poorest developing countries are being swindled out of EUR 92 billion a year in tax revenues , while the World Bank estimates that just a third of that - EUR 30 billion to EUR 34 billion - would pay for the UN 's Millennium Development Goals .
( NL ) Madam President , the debate further to Mr Böge 's question has not actually borne a great deal of fruit .
This challenge requires practical responses from the EU that are designed to tackle not only cooperation for development but also foreign policy , implementing preventive measures at both regional and global level , measures which make use of all the foreign policy instruments available , and are focused on security , regional cooperation , bilateral agreements with countries of origin and transit , and protection of human rights and democratisation .
Indeed , the Union has become a preferred target of international crime .
However , around 25 million Europeans suffer from rare diseases and they should therefore be given the opportunity to receive healthcare in other Member States .
You probably know that the Council is preparing for the next round of talks on human rights between the European Union and China . These talks will take place in Ljubljana on 15 May .
We are talking about a country that has 165 million inhabitants , is in possession of nuclear weapons and is engaged in a fight against terrorist organisations such as Al Qaeda and the Taliban .
The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights , which is the text that the Court applies , is quite old - it dates back to 1950 - and , like the Treaty of Rome , it was also signed in Rome .
We have been working with your great support over the last months on this challenge .
It took a long time to choose a line that would be balanced enough for both consumers and businesses .
This should be interesting when you consider that Hungary is currently subject to a barrage of international criticism because of its new media law and this law is clearly in conflict with Article 11 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
The main objective is to ensure fast and easy movement of people and goods among Member States .
We should like to hear your opinion on this , Commissioner Kuneva .
We are able to say today that it was the right decision .
The number of new infections continues to outstrip the expansion of treatment , and two thirds of the people in need of treatment in 2009 were still not receiving it , which means that 10 million people in need did not have access to the necessary effective treatment .
Companies which do not manage to adapt in time risk facing fines , which it will not be possible to pass on to consumers .
MEPs need to inform themselves of the consequences of this proposal .
However , it is not enough to give a hungry person a fish : they must be taught to fish .
Above all , I would like to emphasise his initiative in refining the definition of airport charges , and secondly the airports we are covering , and the service levels of airports and their correlation with the obligations of airport operators .
European satellite navigation programmes ( EGNOS and Galileo ) ( signature )
( RO ) Madam President , Romania has a law stipulating that teachers ' salaries should be increased , because they are very low .
This underlines how important we believe this agenda is .
The blame game will not do anyone any good .
I am confident that this House will have a future opportunity to have all its provisions successfully adopted in a less compromised piece of legislation that will truly and comprehensively protect citizens from major respiratory damage .
Firstly , there should be a target from 2010 onwards and then a limit from 2015 onwards of 25 micrograms per cubic meter .
Without common rules , those border crossing points where the VIS is not systematically used could be exploited by illegal immigrants and criminals .
The Amsterdam Treaty further enhanced these codecision rights , while the Lisbon Treaty will establish codecision as the rule in the crafting of European legislation , and therefore refers , appropriately , to the ' ordinary legislative procedure ' .
I want to thank all fellow Members for the professional job they have done .
Since then , not only has the number of members of the European Union increased , but also its ambition and responsibilities .
I believe that we need to be cautious , we need to give time for the clarifications to be given on the issues of concern to the Irish voters and we need time for those issues to be debated in full and in public - and in due time allow the electorate to give their view .
This is all very well .
I should like to ask the Commissioner once more whether he , too , can envisage any possibilities for exchanging Dutch practice with other Member States who are facing the same problems , particularly in large towns and cities .
22 .
So what are we really doing ?
It is important that our policy of engagement has been openly supported by representatives of civil society in Belarus , who took part recently in a very helpful discussion with Members of this Parliament .
Not as far as I am concerned .
In connection with this week 's visit to Strasbourg by the European Network for Independent Living , and welcoming the Commission 's commitment to ' ring fence ' a fixed percentage of its overseas development assistance to health , education and social services , which steps is the Commission making to make sure community development projects for disabled people benefit from these funds ?
Mr Ford raised some of the issues about bilateral relations .
If we advise young people to express their views violently , then we must fear for the European Union .
Just one year after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , we are holding a discussion on the forthcoming adoption of the regulation on the citizens ' initiative .
The impact differs from one geographical area to another , but it is a cross - border impact and needs to be addressed with Europe 's assistance .
We also like to talk about European integration .
The new Member States are obviously focusing mainly on catching up with the more developed countries of the European Union in terms of development .
We want to understand trends , to try to make policies more relevant ; we do not want to pry into people 's personal lives .
Granting more visas is one policy that Italy can pursue to try to help those countries .
- Mr President , I just wish to agree very much with my colleague , Dr Charles Tannock .
These changes have been felt most painfully by nations in the most difficult economic situation and countries at war .
On the other hand , the programmes will be of benefit mainly to large agricultural enterprises with competitive production costs .
More specifically , the 2007 bilateral aid programme with Armenia is targeting financial support in the field of judicial reform , to the tune of EUR 18 million .
Such programmes must also be developed without additional financial expenditure and bureaucracy .
It is important that the second instrument allows for this assistance to be given irrespective of the consent of the governments of third countries and other public authorities .
I think that one such opportunity is encouraging the participation not only of the elderly , but also of young people , families living in difficult circumstances and people with reduced mobility in the social tourism programmes developed by the Union .
The first concerns cooperation among the authorities in Europe .
At present , 63 % of the programmes under the Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund remain unapproved , as do 83 % of European Social Fund programmes and 75 % of rural development programmes , even though the first programme year is already coming to an end .
Indeed , why allow Korea to have duty drawback , which is a benefit that has never been granted before , not even to developing countries such as the countries of the Mediterranean ?
In addition , stricter rules will be introduced for unavoidable traces of heavy metals .
I welcome the Commission 's intention to launch a Green Paper on revising the VAT system with the goal of creating an environment that is more favourable to business , and a system that is simpler and more robust for the Member States .
However , I fear that , overall , the report seems overly inclined towards increased taxes , when in several countries ( such as Portugal ) , we are already experiencing an overdose of fiscal burdens .
Each of us , because of our culture , our character and our political position is liable to see it from a particular point of view .
Many have urged for the regulation of the lists of unfair contract terms .
I support the Fava report , which we will use to impose harsher punishments on employers using illegal labour .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
( GA ) Madam President , as a Member for Ireland , I cannot say that I am too proud of what is currently happening in my own country .
I urge you to write to the Member States I have just mentioned , to speed up implementation of this important directive .
So , after years of the EU isolating Belarus , I now agree that a pragmatic stick and carrot approach is the correct one .
( The President cut off the speaker )
It is essential to promote the strengthening of parliamentary scrutiny , to support free and pluralist media , the independence of the judiciary and the empowerment of civil society , giving priority to women , vulnerable groups and minorities .
We can do so straight away by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and drawing up a suitable forestry policy that recognises the multiple environmental services performed by forests , particularly as carbon sinks .
( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Jouyet , I am a member of the ACP - EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly and during the last session held in Kigali , Rwanda , I listened to President Paul Kagame , who spoke of the need to stabilise the situation in Central Africa .
Firstly , the nation state is a form of political organisation which , in historical terms , seeks to unify territories , rationalise public action and subsequently pave the way to democratic systems .
Private equity companies will have to give notification of their presence in the companies acquired and provide information to employees , in particular , concerning their future strategy for the business and the potential repercussions for jobs .
It continually refers to the right of the internal market to govern what happens .
President of the Commission . - We are not forcing anyone to take any measures .
It is true that the reasons for the deficits we see in Europe are different .
Its aim is to take dialogue and cooperation ' beyond development ' , ' beyond Africa ' and ' beyond institutions ' by means of greater EU - Africa cooperation within international bodies and in multilateral negotiations , on issues such as human rights and climate change .
It is a matter of principle .
This kind of monitoring system would not be feasible and would subsequently be considered unacceptable .
Indeed , the EU and IMF must allocate considerable macroeconomic aid to cover the budget deficit and social costs for the subsequent period .
I should like to register my strong protest against this state of affairs , and also mention a situation that is gaining notoriety in the United States .
the report by Linda McAvan , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco - management and audit scheme - C 6-0278/2008 - .
The EU should concentrate on strengthening internal security and increasing the defensive capabilities of its members , especially Member States which share a border with countries where extreme nationalist ideologies are popular , and also Member States which have attracted the interest of terrorist groups .
It is essential to create a common EU database of organs available for donation and transplantation , and a database of all living and deceased donors .
The money should be given , or given back , to where it comes from , namely the taxpayers .
- Before the vote
There was no serious debate in committee .
Instead of seriously analysing the part that the EU itself played in this failure , the majority of this House persists in picking scapegoats such as China ( whose per capita atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide are less than half those of the EU ) , and now the countries of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America .
There is a bilateral agreement between Italy and Belarus , which means that Italy is not affected by the ban .
Situations in which key provisions of the Directive are interpreted differently in the different Member States are also inadmissible .
This would mean an end to broadcasting in Hungarian , Ruthenian and Ukrainian .
In my opinion , it is important to implement these measures at source .
It is very important that the application of this regulation is not exclusively limited to large , socially isolated communities , but that its provisions can also be applied to the most socially vulnerable groups , like the disabled , the poor , needy young families , immigrants and others , who also suffer from social isolation and do not have opportunities to renovate their homes .
rapporteur . - Mr President , we now have a text which says : ' Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission ' , and I would like to add the words ' and the governments and parliaments of the Member States ' .
The current compromise takes these considerations into account and not only ensures that potentially dangerous chemicals are traded in a responsible way but also provides the room for manoeuvre that is needed so that the international exchange of goods can continue to run smoothly .
We are very proud and glad that we joined the euro , and we will be staying .
We are completely dependent on one another in the matter of energy , but that dependence needs to work both ways .
I remember President Reagan 's speech here in 1985 , and to quote an Irish poet - William Butler Yeats - speaking of his Ireland , in a poem called Easter Sunday 1916 he said : ' All 's changed , changed utterly ; a terrible beauty has been born ' .
However , you are asking a lot of Parliament .
It not only has a father , Mr Bowis , but also a mother , Mrs Grossetête .
The German company E. ON has been granted access to Siberian reserves and the energy market , and both countries will jointly build a gas pipeline , an umbilical cord , under the Baltic Sea .
To underscore this need , the Commission published Recommendation No 207/425 / EC of 13 July 2007 , identifying a set of actions for the enforcement of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein .
in writing . - ( NL ) I have voted against this report , because directives of this kind undermine the Member States ' capacity to be in control of their own territories and to take the appropriate measures to maintain law and order .
As for the importance of introducing courses in European law and European history into the school curriculum , the Commission shares the opinion that young people should be taught the essential facts about the European Union at school .
This year , after intensive consultations with all interested groups , the Commission will also publish a White Paper on adaptation , which will represent a basis for further discussions concerning the European Union 's policy in this area .
During the drafting of my report , I had the marvellous experience of working with fantastic colleagues from the secretariat of our Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection .
Moreover , in addition to the significant increase in the efficiency of border controls , a systematic consultation of the Visa Information System would also constitute a preliminary condition for greater flexibility when submitting the visa application .
I even wonder at times where the glass is , when it comes to Bosnia .
We should look at how we might increase the higher - education qualifications of a number of people who never had that opportunity in their youth .
I congratulate Turkey on the symbolic steps it has taken and on the dialogue which the government has explicitly sought .
This refers to the amount of risk that banks must retain in their own balance sheets when they place ' structured ' products with savers .
I also believe in this sense that the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which is a beautiful text which should be read by every child in the European schools and which should be worked on by every student in our universities , really makes the right point : there is no difference between men and women .
But on a note of caution : the European Parliament 's control over this will be particularly unbending .
It has adopted many reports and opinions which deserve more attention from the other committees in Parliament .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , what worries me most is the suggestion that the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) has a significant role to play in solving the financial crisis - that it can somehow act as the Europe - wide body to provide stimulus where Member States have singularly failed to coordinate their own stimuli .
I support the rapporteur 's opinion that the European Union should take the lead in making the notion of this duty a reality .
Current knowledge and technical solutions enable us , and will long continue to permit us , to use renewable sources only as a supplement .
All the speakers who are now bemoaning the fact that prices are rising - finally heading upwards for once - and are calling for measures to hold back the price rises .
Oral questions and written declarations ( submission ) : see Minutes
Closure of the sitting
I believe , as you do , that this crisis is also , and above all , a crisis of our values , of the basic values of our society .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am honoured to conclude this very constructive debate .
However , on this last point , I have to say that the Democratic Movement 's delegation was disappointed .
- ( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Minister of Justice , it is precisely in this capacity that I should like to address you at the end of this debate .
Finally , I would like to welcome Mrs McGuinness on her initiative to put this issue to scrutiny before the Commission .
In the short term , implementation of a mechanism to compensate the European farmers most affected must be guaranteed , while in the medium term , it will be necessary to reform the early warning system for unsafe food to prevent any more unfounded alarms in the future .
( PL ) Mr President , the debate triggered by Mr Sacconi 's question is of great relevance to the citizens of Europe .
They are neither a nation without a state nor a national minority .
The existing limit on housing expenditure of 3 % of the European Regional Development Fund allocation is decidedly too low .
All of this has led to an erosion of trust in Russia as a European partner .
( LV ) Firstly , I would like to thank the Commissioner and the majority of my fellow Members for truly liberal access to the electricity market , which together with energy efficiency measures will really allow us to reduce prices in the future .
In this case you are underestimating the power of your own resolutions , although we seek to monitor and guarantee compliance with such decisions .
( NL ) Mr President , I see that , fortunately , I am not the only one who very much questions this rather absurd initiative , the apparent purpose of which is to brand Italy a country where freedom of information is fundamentally under threat .
( Applause and heckling )
For example , more work will be needed on the capital calibration of complex products and of banks ' ability to identify potential problems in crisis situations , including potential concentration of risks in certain areas .
Madam President , it is an oral amendment on compensation for farmers , with thanks to Mrs Rivasi for the initiative .
Of course some countries are further ahead in this struggle than others .
Indeed , I believe it is vital to stress the importance of social protection for the assisting spouses or recognised life partners of self - employed workers .
I think that this is a very one - sided approach .
I remember when the Iranian people rose up to get rid of the Shah , and we know how that ended , with a regime that still hangs dozens of people even now .
It did this despite difficult conditions - the political situation at home is not exactly easy , of course , the Treaty of Lisbon is new and even the relationship with the European Council is not all that easy .
So we are having a debate , but I can assure you that there will be a clear next step in this screening exercise .
The important points here are that we must defend and improve the European social model and that it is high time we introduced a social progress clause as a binding protocol to the existing EU Treaties .
At the same time , the amount of payment appropriations is decreasing by 3.3 % , and the amount of payment appropriations for EU cohesion policy is decreasing most rapidly - by 14 % .
Altogether , several hundred more workers have been made redundant .
You already confirmed , I think , what many of us feel - that with all the work that is currently going on to implement the Services Directive , the Green Paper on the consumer acquis , which we have just considered and which will result in a horizontal instrument in that area plus the other work that is going on - which my colleague from the Committee on Legal Affairs , Ms Kauppi , and I know Ms Wallis will cover later - I think it is much too early to contemplate any further detailed provisions at this stage .
This is a very important issue .
The forthcoming summit in Stockholm will discuss a range of issues important to the EU , Russia and , indeed , the wider global community , and Parliament has today sent a united message highlighting the areas of key interest and concern .
I would , however , like to draw attention to three important elements in this report .
In spite of what I have said , there is no room for complacency .
They should not give the impression today that they are leading the others .
The introduction of a public register to which lobbies must sign up if they are to have access to these two institutions constitutes genuine democratic progress to the benefit of citizens .
( PL ) Mr President , the European Commission 's initiative to impose on Member States the duty to publish information on the beneficiaries of EU funds obtained under the umbrella of the common agricultural policy is worthy of support in every respect .
Today we not only have to improve safety conditions , we also have to strengthen the European Atomic Energy Community and move towards a European Energy Community .
A few months ago the Hungarian Prime Minister refused to meet his Slovak counterpart and there is renewed talk about the revision of the outcome of World War II .
With them was a leading Sikh I have come to know .
in writing . - I voted to support Sweden 's nomination of H.G. Wessberg to join the European Court .
Firstly , last January we introduced more frequent decision - making in infringement proceedings with the aim of speeding up cases ; secondly , we launched the ' EU Pilot ' project in 15 Member States last April to test a new method aimed at improving problem solving and the availability of information ; thirdly , the main purpose of this initiative , which is close to Parliament 's interests , is to better serve the interests of citizens and businesses with regard to questions and problems identified in the application of Community law , including infringements of this law ; fourthly , the Commission will nonetheless continue to decide to prosecute infringements in the event of non - conformance within the framework of the ' EU Pilot ' project , particularly through infringement proceedings ; and fifthly , President Barroso has written to the chairman of Parliament 's Committee on Legal Affairs , Mr Gargani , with details of the pilot project 's performance in December 2008 .
This amounts to an unprecedented disparity between citizens of the European Union .
The debate is closed .
Having a Lisbon Strategy that is purely the sum of national initiatives and having a Stability and Growth Pact that puts different amounts of pressure on the various countries using it and subject to it are limitations , to which we can add the limited budget available .
4 .
Madam President , I wonder if Mr Vajgl has considered the cost to the EU taxpayer of these extra - territorial initiatives proposed in the report and which he is also endorsing ?
Last but not least , Madam President , Commissioner , along with our friends from the US and other countries we should draught a comprehensive UN convention against terrorism .
I will try again .
It will not apply to butter or cheese or apple juice , or even alcohol .
In this context , I would like to take up your proposal and confirm that I will soon , in the autumn , propose a new evaluation mechanism following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty for the reasons that you stated , Mr Coelho .
Thank you all the same for the gesture .
To conclude : last week Parliament also held a meeting hosted by Dagmar Roth - Behrendt at which the European Patient Forum outlined its manifesto .
All this is having a negative effect on the people , leading to despair and inciting revolt .
In my opinion , the current mandate is not ambitious enough to achieve this .
The European Parliament adopted a clear and meaningful position by rejecting the possibility of a 65 - hour working week .
If we do not make fresh efforts to combat the crisis in Europe , unemployment will rise to 25 million at the beginning of 2010 , and the condition of public finance will worsen considerably .
The next item is the report by Mrs Merkies , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on Innovation Union : transforming Europe for a post - crisis world .
Whilst it is difficult to set a firm date for this , it is clear that it needs to get under way as soon as possible .
The most important amendment is to change the reference years from 2005-2007 to 2004-2006 , as the data for 2007 are so new that we cannot be certain of them , and it is therefore better to use the data that we are sure of .
The developments in America have demonstrated that the market itself is not capable of dealing with these and similar crises .
The overall approach proposed by the Commission is a continuation of the report by Mario Monti to the President of the European Commission , ' A new strategy for the Single Market ' .
Since the latest enlargement , the Black Sea is also an EU sea .
I would particularly like to talk about the Krehl report .
First of all I want to raise the issue of flexibility of financing instruments in the external area .
You could have made the same mistakes as the previous Belgian Presidency in 2001 .
On few matters can we be so unanimous .
I have read Mr Brok 's report , which was adopted in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on Monday .
Now I use the word ' ask ' with some care .
in writing . - ( IT ) I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) in favour of the Czech Republic , because I consider that instrument to be a valuable resource for the support of workers experiencing difficulty on account of the economic crisis .
As the honourable Member knows , the primary objective of EC competition policy is to make markets work better for the benefit of consumers in the EU .
Statement by the President of the European Parliament 's delegation to the Conciliation Committee - Novel foods ( continuation of debate )
Our businesses , researchers , scientists and universities all find themselves having to compete on a global level with markets that have enormous amounts of resources available to them , often with very much lower costs than our own .
Well , the Irish people decided that they much preferred to be on the EU train than the UKIP bulldozer .
in writing . - ( SV ) The employment policies of the Member States should be determined nationally by way of a broad and democratically anchored debate based on research and national experience .
Finally , we are counting , Commissioner , on your resolve - which we know is considerable - to put a swift end to illegal fishing , which affects bluefin tuna and cod most of all , highly prized species which are heavily overfished at present .
We believe that , if you intend to make such a proposal for the winter flight plan , Parliament will have to examine it carefully , because we would have to consider the interests of the many different types of airlines as well as the interests of airports and passengers more carefully .
You have displayed great diplomatic skills so far working with Russia and Ukraine , but it is vital that the Russian Government understands that holding nations to ransom is no way to conduct business in the modern world .
Therefore , common freedoms and a common market , and not extending Union competences , should be the central principle of the Union 's economic policy .
There is a real danger that brochures and books will remain in offices unread .
As many as nine of the 80 paragraphs in the report are devoted to this matter .
I am cautiously optimistic that the dialogue on this question will continue .
The Belgian Presidency rightly points out that electricity in particular may also cause a division in society as a result of the fact that energy is becoming more expensive and therefore no longer accessible to everyone .
However , I think this will be difficult to achieve .
I must also mention here the important contribution made by Russia in agreeing to our troops and equipment crossing its territory in transit .
Mr Heaton - Harris , regarding the meaning of ' GNSS ' , we now have two options : one is ' Galileo Navigation Satellite System ' and the other is ' Global Navigation Satellite System ' .
Secondly , they do not aim to delete or replace the entire text .
in writing . - UKIP supports the repeal of all EU legislation .
Mr President , I welcome this debate .
Nobody has been able to give an example .
If we are to deliver to consumers , we need to be more responsive to their expectations and better understand the problems they are facing in their day - to - day lives .
The two texts proposed by the Commission , and I take this opportunity to applaud their common sense , correspond to our idea of immigration policy : a reasonably firm and humane policy .
The report focuses on transitional procedural guidelines on budgetary matters in view of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty .
This person 's freedom of movement is being restricted .
We need a campaign to make people aware that the way we live , and the way we work , has an economic and an ecological price attached .
Madam President , we should continue to support the EU membership perspective for the countries of the Western Balkans .
That is the ultimate deadline .
That is , we need to do this without losing sight of the central values and the inviolability of the person springing from the European values created in the melting pot of Jewish , Christian and Hellenistic culture in the centuries before and after the birth of Christ .
The universality of these values must take precedence over geopolitics , once again cynically revealed on 10 December 2010 when 15 countries made a cowardly response to China 's express request that they boycott the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Chinese citizen , Lu Xiaobo .
The mandate also takes on board many suggestions offered by us MEPs , and this speaks volumes for the importance of the European Parliament and for the new role granted to it by the treaty .
Now it must designate an EU representative who will make both sides listen .
It is beyond dispute that our efforts must include confidence building and support for financial stability , as the European Council has also said .
There remain elements of the proposal that could give rise to different interpretations .
( PL ) Mr President , a few months ago the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning xenophobia and burgeoning nationalism in Europe .
I assume that , in a few weeks , we will know whether we in Europe have any legal or technical need to act , and we will then be happy to report back to Parliament again .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( NL ) Cross - border goods trains trundle through the European Union at an average speed of 18 kilometres per hour .
I think it is paragraph 48 that refers to the death penalty .
As always , irrelevant amendments were tabled by different groups on various important matters of principle , such as whether the MRTA should be included in the EU 's list of terrorist organisations , and on attempts to implement a peace process in Colombia .
The result was the EU action plan for strengthening the EU 's involvement in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
That is the point of this debate and also of the resolution , and I therefore support it wholeheartedly .
The proposed measures place at the forefront the consumer , who in a well functioning internal energy market will be able to choose from among suppliers and opt for the best one based on his own judgement .
The instruments associated with the Green Paper present a series of measures without offering systemic solutions .
Since 1 May 2009 , it has also been possible to use this fund to support workers made redundant as a result of the effects of the economic crisis and of the financial markets , which makes it even more relevant and necessary .
( DE ) Madam President , to keep everything up to date , I would ask that the following text be incorporated , which you will find on your voting list :
Welcome once again after 18 years .
He has made that promise , regardless of the fact that both houses of the UK Parliament ratified the Treaty of Lisbon in mid - 2008 .
As we have seen with the recent Nobel Prize and Sakharov Prize winners , protection of these human rights defenders is of the utmost importance and these measures are a step toward that end .
In conclusion I can therefore say that I welcome the present agreement , and shall be voting in favour of it .
The Treaties provide us with a basis for this cooperation .
The report from Mrs Estrela deals with the issue of reducing health inequalities in the EU .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , recently , in the Rüffert case , a Polish company paid 53 workers only 46 % of the agreed wage for the trade in Germany .
We must reduce the considerable gap between the standards and policies adopted at European level and their application at national level .
With particular reference to economic and trade agreements with third countries or WTO negotiations , the EU sometimes pays insufficient attention to the rights of workers , minorities , women and children outside the EU , becoming a tacit accomplice in criminal atrocities and intolerable practices .
This involves us similarly seeking and finding worldwide cooperation , such as in the approach we have created at the International Criminal Court .
In view of this , the Council unanimously agreed a well - balanced budget that invested resources in education , research , infrastructure , cohesion , responsible public finances and margins for unforeseen events ; in other words , all the factors that we know to be important for growth and prosperity .
I absolutely reject this report , albeit that unfortunately , no final vote is possible in the second reading .
I rushed down to support Mrs Gräßle in her efforts and I think we all are doing that here today .
The Mediterranean is the hope of three monotheistic religions and the civilisation of wheat and wine , not of sauerkraut and beer or mussels in Chez Léon .
in writing . - ( SK ) On 8 March 2007 on the occasion of International Woman 's Day , the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament began its campaign for the eradication of violence against women .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality . - ( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , we in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality believe that the success of the first phase of the programme was less encouraging in terms of the participation of women : female students did account for 44 % , but participation differed greatly depending on the country , and female academics only accounted for 22 % , which , in our view , is unacceptable .
The EU must also do better with regard to the protection of biodiversity .
Let us work for the security of our citizens and let us take the steps necessary in this regard .
That move may be based on grounds of swiftness and unity in decision making .
First of all , we seem to have concentrated on new proposals when we all know that there is existing legislation which Member States are struggling to implement - and this has created an ill - at - ease feeling amongst Member States , because they are clearly not prepared to move on to new laws when they have difficulties with existing ones .
This new crisis has once again highlighted the inability of the Haitian authorities and of the health system to cope with this crisis .
We welcome EU initiatives to combat tuberculosis through this resolution , but we call for more scientific research to be undertaken to develop new forms of vaccine against this disease .
the oral question on the Council 's strategy for the Bali Conference on Climate Change ( COP 13 and COP / MOP 3 ) , by Guido Sacconi , on behalf of the Temporary Committee on Climate Change to the Council - B 6-0379/2007 ) , and
The purpose of this initiative is to facilitate the position of consumers within the European Union .
I ask myself : how is that ?
However , I would like to draw attention to one particular paragraph in Mrs Hedh 's report - namely paragraph 40 , in which we propose the establishment of a European Consumer Agency .
I am sure we will return to this matter again .
More importantly , what can be changed in future ?
Finally , I welcome the assessment made by Mr Ehler , stressing the absence of an appropriate legislative framework that has financial resources available to it .
Moreover , they also showed the route taken by Central and Eastern Europe to freedom and democracy , and to the end of the division , not only of Germany , but of the whole of Europe .
However , this aspiration and potential are restricted by financial , bureaucratic and other kinds of obstacles .
These are funds with different and complementary objectives , beyond which one cannot replace the other .
We hope that the French Presidency includes in its objectives the European Charter of Duties .
Seven days before your question was tabled , on 30 September , the Irish Finance Minister , Mr Lenihan , discussed the total cost of the restructuring of the Anglo Irish Bank , giving two possible figures : a mid - range estimate of EUR 29 billion and a higher estimate of EUR 34 billion .
The aim of the EGF is to help workers who are victims of the relocation of companies , and it is fundamental in facilitating their future access to new employment .
In general , four issues emerged from the discussions that were of particular concern to the Commission .
The zone system is artificial and contrary to the European Union 's principle of subsidiarity , and , as the remarks of my fellow Member from the Netherlands have just demonstrated , it makes flexible response impossible .
I am convinced that , in this spirit , you can pave the way for the emergence of a balanced solution , soon .
For the moment , there are no meat surpluses in the internal market , and that is why private storage measures cannot be justified at present .
Even the few contacts between the child and the father are full of obstacles .
Trade relations with these countries are just as important for the Union .
It is , therefore , essential for this knowledge to be as rigorous and up - to - date as possible , meaning that there must be sufficient financing for this purpose , specifically through the financial instruments of the common fisheries policy .
I wish the Spanish Presidency every success in achieving its priorities and in finding solutions to the challenges which the European Union is currently facing .
It is a milestone in terms of the environmental compatibility of European vehicles , as environmental compatibility , of course , is something that will not only be achieved through producing more fuel - efficient engines - cars also offer other entirely different options for saving fuel and reducing pollution .
Working with you has also been a lot of fun .
Of course we want effectiveness .
We therefore ask for the debate , the draft resolution , and then the vote at the next sitting .
This debate is therefore not yet over .
If we really want to strengthen the global competitive position of the EU , we cannot allow certain regions to be left behind because of obsolete infrastructure and poor educational , social and health services .
The vote on this report coincides with the publication , last week , of a UNHCR study on the 44 industrialised nations .
The one - China policy is outdated and morally undermining to the image of the European Union .
What we need is a pure and simple ban on all blending and mixing in Europe , and in France in particular .
We know also that a worldwide fiscal and monetary stimulus to our economy can be twice as effective in every country if it is adopted by all countries .
( RO ) I would like to congratulate Mr Stolojan for all his efforts in drafting the report on the recovery of claims .
It is true that we are in the middle of a crisis , and the Court , which is maintained from voluntary contributions made by various countries , absorbs large sums of money .
Another issue has arisen with regard to the future of this sector , which I personally - but the other Commissioners , too - consider absolutely vital for the economy of the European Union , but above all that of certain mountainous regions and regions with a particularly difficult hydrogeological system .
As Mrs Bauer has said , the topic we are debating is as old as the Treaty of Rome .
Naturally , we have been very cautious on that point .
As a result of this , many jobs are both lost and created every day in Europe .
The European Parliament must strive to strengthen parliamentary scrutiny , by implementing a common foreign and security policy and actively exercising legislative , budget formation and discharge functions .
That is why it is very important to set up as quickly as possible the economic governance that was decided in the Task Force , which was debated on the basis of six proposals from the Commission to Parliament , and for all those involved in codecision to reach agreement .
However , when drawing up the regulation , we also took into account the fact that some of the mines are not competitive and have only survived so far thanks to constant injections of public money and public subsidies .
If you will allow me to make a further comment , in this instance on matters relating to financial markets , it must of course be said that while legislation has been passed to ensure that the events of two years ago cannot be repeated , the Fed has now , for example , decided to place USD 600 million on the market without consultation , with the result that naturally , there are fears concerning inflation and other things and some turbulence in the global economy .
It is good that the report adopts a broader approach and addresses the factors which contribute to increased support for and renewed recruitment to groups which reject our models of society in favour of violence and sectarianism .
Our responsibility is shared , first of all because the situation of the Roma has not changed fundamentally in the new Member States after enlargement or in the candidate countries while awaiting enlargement .
There is a worrying cloak of secrecy over certain still unknown details of the agreement .
The motion for a resolution - and I pay tribute for this to our rapporteur - is a well - balanced one , especially since we have taken into account the interests of our partners from the ACP countries , as well as local European banana producers .
Finally , territorial cooperation deserves particular attention in the next Cohesion Policy .
Time is of the essence .
in writing . - ( RO ) I abstained from the vote on this motion for a resolution because the European Union needs to have a much more mature reflection on the balance between security and freedom .
The unquestionable benefit of the approved legislation comes from improving the quality and therefore the safety of tyres .
After an extremely long period of waiting we are finally in a position to make Europol into a concrete and effective tool in combating organised crime , as well as many other dangerous types of crime which are now manifesting themselves at European level - I am thinking , for instance , of the action that Europol will be able to take on money - laundering .
We do not believe that the question of financing a universal service in small Member States and in remote areas has been properly tackled .
Our initial exchange of views on this involved looking at how we set targets , how we follow them up , how we evaluate results .
8 .
The strategy envisages a new legislative framework in the form of a general animal health law to be supplemented by implementing acts of a primarily technical nature .
Approval of motor vehicles and their trailers ( vote )
Since I am a Member from a country which has not yet ratified the Lisbon Treaty , I should like to invite the Governments of the Czech Republic , Sweden and , of course , Ireland too to work hard on the ratification of this document , because it is the prerequisite for more unified and more effective common foreign and security policies enabling us to deal with the challenges , including the challenges coming from the East and from Russia , and to solve these problems .
There was a major debate in committee and we reached a very intelligent , high - quality compromise through the intervention of Monica Frassoni .
( RO ) Mr. President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to join my colleagues who welcomed the drawing up of this report and to emphasize its fundamental value for the future of Europe .
Therefore , I believe that we should aim for a postponement and then ultimately ....
Work placements are a good example of how university students can gain practical experience and then subsequently bring that experience into their studies .
This strategy must recognise the value of prevention , including the fight against the recruitment of terrorists and all factors favouring violent radicalisation .
In some countries instances of criminal treatment of Polish workers have come to light , forcing them into slave labour .
Mr President , Europe cannot upgrade its relations with Israel until its government convincingly demonstrates a change of course .
Furthermore , the Slovenian Presidency has asked , for procedural and official reasons , for the meeting to be postponed until the next plenary part - session in Belgium .
If the Europeans now start to question whether we really want a legally binding agreement , it will call into question a process that , under the aegis of the United Nations , has been supported by many Europeans for many years .
It is actually not an argument at all ; it is a knock - out argument .
A transport system which works well on the local level is better than a service which is terminated due to excessive regulation .
I am in agreement with this .
We can be partners in this field only if the European Union could incorporate nuclear energy issues more openly in its policies .
Firstly , as regards Croatia : the accession negotiations with Croatia are proceeding according to plan and at this point I would like to express my agreement with Mr Swoboda 's view that , over the last two years , Croatia has made substantial progress in meeting the accession benchmarks .
There is no free press .
I must say that , in my opinion , anything which reduces unnecessary conflict not only ensures more justice for the people , but also , in particular , creates more confidence between those involved in the legal process .
The ultimate aim is a better enforcement of EU laws and thus , healthier animals and decent living conditions for the relevant animals .
For this reason , we very much welcome the fact that the lead committee has taken our amendments on board in its report and is proposing a structure that puts less strain on our budget .
In doing this we were able to count on the excellent cooperation we have had with Member States and with the ECB .
The cosmetics market is full of fanciful promises and quasi - scientific mumbo - jumbo , where the copywriter 's verbal flamboyance is the only yardstick in testing the product 's efficacy .
Today 's adoption of the Le Foll report on adapting European agriculture to climate change goes along with this approach .
The cost of protecting the euro must be reduced in such a way that we force the commercial banks to acknowledge their losses .
The debate is closed .
However , with Economic and Monetary Union , we at least have the instruments to tackle the problems more effectively .
Why on earth have discussions never been held over the adoption of measures to impose a genuine and effective separation between commercial banks and speculative banks , as in the Glass - Steagall Act ?
Well aware that the work carried out by ENISA has significant community interest , I hope it will receive increased resources .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Given the existing trends and potential increase in dependence , the current reform of the common fisheries policy is a good opportunity for the EU to reinforce the economic performance of the sector and its ability to compete globally .
Another astounding thing is the times at which these agencies become active .
Let this be a lesson to us .
Given the latest enlargement of the EU to 27 Member States and with the increase in EU staff that implies , the significance of a well - reformed European School has become an issue of high priority .
May this publicising of their plight in Europe afford them protection !
This is something which is not in the interests of the matter as a whole and which absolutely must not happen .
Thanks to the excellent cooperation between Commission , Council and Member States in handling national reform programmes and recommendations , the first European Semester has lasted a semester , and not a day longer .
You have both done an excellent job .
Please understand my response , Mr Leichtfried , as a gesture , a desire to offer you a clarification .
( HU ) Mr Boştinaru , I have two questions that I would like to ask : do Romanian laws allow the granting of citizenship to individuals of Romanian nationality even if they do not live in the territory of Romania ?
What I can confirm is that the Commission will soon be proposing an amendment to the regulation on credit rating agencies in order to entrust the new European Securities and Markets Authority ( ESMA ) with overall responsibility for supervising these agencies .
By way of example , we are seeing a general slump in livestock farming in favour of imports of sheep from third countries .
However , let us not argue about whether or not to alter the guidelines ; let us discuss whether or not the substantive changes contained in our demand for the guidelines to be altered are practicable .
Are you willing to listen to him ?
( Applause )
Mr President , I would like to welcome the Spanish Presidency very warmly .
The approach to be adopted by the EU should treat the issue of human rights as a fundamental factor , on the one hand , and , on the other , recognise the stabilising role of Iran in the region on condition that it normalises relations with its neighbours and other international players , gives up its nuclear programme and improves human and democratic conditions .
You have to follow the ruling consistently , Mr President .
Secondly , everything that happens in Europe takes place in the context of the treaties .
I am also of the view that the question as to who is responsible is an important one .
in writing . - ( SV ) This report , which does not form part of any legislative process , recommends a number of costly proposals , such as an EU agency for product quality and new sales promotion and sales supporting measures within agriculture .
In addition , Copenhagen will only be a success story if it ensures sustainable development , if it also includes a social dimension and , in particular , if we , the developed part of the world , succeed in financing developing countries .
Thank you , and I congratulate the rapporteur .
We therefore need a European spirit and we need this Reform Treaty !
First of all I wish to thank my colleague Karl - Heinz Florenz for his outstanding work and his constant devotion to this issue .
They may possibly meet requirements , as you said , either by green harvesting or by destroying a small portion of the harvest in the event of small imbalances between demand and supply in normal years , but certainly not in the case of a widespread crisis such as the one we are experiencing .
The Member States should enhance their cooperation and coordination so as to guarantee solidarity and the availability of additional rapid mobilisation resources to fight these disasters .
I mourn his death as both a colleague and a friend of his and I am going to ask President Buzek to send his family and the Spanish Government a message of heartfelt condolence and support , which I am sure that all of us here share .
In general within Europe this makes companies pull up their socks , improve their products and services , try harder globally .
I would like to concentrate very briefly on three key dossiers which will be under the spotlight .
There is a need to implement a new binding financial agreement that will force transnational companies to declare the profits they make and the taxes they pay , on a country by country basis , in order to ensure transparency in respect of what they pay in each of the countries in which they operate .
( Laughter )
As the rapporteur also emphasises , we not only need to recognise this problem of soil deterioration , but we also have to allocate the necessary financial resources to combat its adverse effects .
Secondly , the risks linked with organ transplantation continue to be a major concern .
The Commission has drafted a regulation on the methods for implementing safeguard measures within the context of this agreement .
We are utterly opposed to the reflection of the new criteria in the future development of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) , as is also being argued there , so keeping this policy in the sphere of rural development with cofinancing ; in other words , retaining another way of discriminating between countries .
One practical measure which can be taken is to set up an emergency number for gender - based violence in Member States .
In the process , it will destroy people 's lives .
Biodiversity is restricted and the limitation of contamination can certainly not be guaranteed .
Therefore , we must have a new dialogue about enlargement , as Mr Severin from the Social Democrats has proposed , which covers gradual integration and new forms of membership , in order to be able to reconcile these two legitimate objectives .
Regarding the proposed exclusion of organ transplantation , I simply cannot agree .
These agreements are a milestone in our partnership , demonstrating once again the concrete benefits that our closer relationship can bring for the people of Georgia .
This vast and strategically vital region is being pulled three ways : by China , by Russia and by Europe .
This is an important message and we will come back to this in the legislative proposals .
This applies no matter who is appointed .
As one who frequently uses the Internet , writes blogs and is active on Facebook and Twitter , I know that there are quite a few problems here .
This balance appears difficult but it is not .
Therefore , I support the report , as in my opinion this will result in costly duplicate structures , which is demonstrated , among other things , by the fact that the individual supervisory bodies are based in different cities .
The vote will take place on Thursday , 19 June 2008 .
( PL ) Justice Goldstone certainly cannot be considered a paragon of objectivity .
That is why we have voted against .
We need an assessment , based on shared values , of the crimes committed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the KGB .
Three principal factors have affected these relations .
The problem is that not everyone wants to recognise this kind of discrimination as a violation of human rights .
The principle of mutual recognition and enforcement of court judgments , which eight years ago , in 1999 , was described by the European Council in Tampere as the cornerstone of judicial cooperation , is making no progress .
2 .
on behalf of the PPE - DE Group . - Mr President , sometimes , in this Chamber , we cannot really see the political differences between groups , but , on this issue , the difference is very visible , because I could not disagree more with the rapporteur on some of the points she just mentioned .
The OIE Scientific and Technical Review identified that only 6 % of cloned embryos resulted in healthy , long - term surviving clones .
In my country , Poland , despite the crisis and difficulties with transposition , it has been possible to draft a law on services which is based on a high degree of liberalisation in registering and running a business .
We are privatising state economies on the pretext of free competition , but we are nationalising relations between men and women .
On monitoring , it is our strong belief that the appropriate institution is the Special Commission of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Inter - Country Adoption .
While we are on the subject of common values , I would like to thank you especially , on behalf of my Group , for focusing your activities on the battle to abolish the death penalty and for creating a European Day against the Death Penalty , one of the glories of the Portuguese Council Presidency .
At the same time , local and regional authorities will play a crucial role in promoting this database via the most suitable means possible so that the information is as easily accessible as possible to citizens .
I am pleased to note that they share our concern .
I think we are losing time in Europe .
That , of course , is the responsibility of each State .
As part of the European Neighbourhood Policy , the European Union can then initiate or support the reforms needed in the country .
It is absolutely necessary to recognise their professional status and to define their rights .
In addition , I fear that this money will be used in large part for the recruitment of non - accredited assistants under national wage terms .
Budgetary planning must be founded on a realistic scenario .
Parliament does not wish to go beyond its remit .
This brutal incident , the victim of which was a high - ranking state official fighting for equal rights for minorities in Pakistan , is further evidence of how difficult the situation is in that country .
However , the pact seems to be having some difficulties getting off the ground , because Parliament , in particular , is having to deal with a sizeable legislative package .
I support your commitment to the creation of a common energy market , interconnecting energy grids all around Europe .
These weaknesses in budgetary planning do not therefore give us the guarantee of specific value for these four agencies .
Thirdly , strict quality criteria must be followed and , fourthly , the Member States must put in place effective monitoring mechanisms .
The debate so far leads me to believe that Annex 2 will be retained in its present form .
On the other hand , while the dependence on networks and information systems increases , the ability to respond to problems still seems inadequate .
A particular example is the issue of the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons .
This initiative forms part of the global strategy to protect critical infrastructures .
It is disappointing that the ECR Group and its Conservative Members , who are clearly against any financial transaction tax , have chosen in their statements to deliberately misrepresent today 's vote as a call for an EU - only FTT .
East Timor does , however , seem to have forgotten the sacrifices it made during its war of independence to put an end to its brutal occupation by Indonesia lasting 24 years , and the joy with which it celebrated its own independence .
They are based on faith not fact .
This is a call to the Commission - we want measures to reduce private motoring and meat consumption so that we have more grain to feed people !
In the treaty infringement proceedings and the European Court of Justice , we have a powerful weapon .
In the case of credit offers , the information given to consumers will be contained in a new European credit information form .
I wholeheartedly endorse those sentiments and consider that they can be applied across the EU 's workload .
The Dublin system currently in force , under which the wishes of asylum seekers , for example , their choice of a European country , cannot be taken into consideration , must be revised to the effect that people who are recognised as being in special need of protection are also able to live in another EU country .
( PL ) Madam President , I would like to make sure I am understood correctly .
Now is the time to bring this process finally to an end .
A year later we are still waiting for the Council .
When we look at the renewable energy scenario , we should also always consider what is happening in the Member States .
However , all that will be a drop in the ocean compared to what could be achieved if we had a properly functioning government .
It seeks to eliminate provisions included in previous bilateral agreements that violated Union Law , and which threatened equality of treatment between companies owned by nationals of different Member States .
I have every confidence in this happening .
( The President cut off the speaker )
The hundreds of millions of useless chargers and adapters in Europe place a ridiculous burden on the environment and , at the same time , are an expensive irritation for consumers .
In March and June 2010 , the European Council adopted the Europe 2020 strategy , the main priority of which is enhanced coordination of economic policy strategies in the Member States and , as a long - term goal , sustainable and inclusive growth and sustainable employment .
This is the supervision package that I was referring to before and on which I had a response from Mr Verhofstadt .
That is why I was very willing and very happy to come to this Chamber today to debate the issue of body scanners .
I have drawn attention to this issue repeatedly in the past .
A whole range of very grave issues have rightly been raised here in connection with the latest recall campaigns of an American manufacturer , which has recalled faulty products from the market at its own initiative .
That is why I expressed strong criticism , in committee too .
The United Kingdom is a great nation .
the report by Salvatore Tatarella , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community Ecolabel scheme - C 6-0279/2008 - , and
What are the criteria and mechanisms for allocating these resources ?
I understand your question , but think that we also need to raise awareness and make parents more vigilant , because rogue traders will always exist .
With regard to visa facilitation , we have begun talks in the Council .
I am going to listen to you closely as I am convinced that perfecting the right of asylum is an important issue for the future and , I would say , for our design of Europe which must remain true to its great tradition of welcoming people .
By voting in favour of the report as a whole , I am supporting the many good elements it contains , but I also recognise the fact that the majority sees nuclear energy as part of Europe 's CO 2 - free energy mix .
I also believe that Croatia 's accession will accelerate the integration of the whole region of the former Yugoslavia into the EU , in particular as Montenegro 's rapporteur and a strong friend of Serbia .
I support the strengthening of the ' data protection ' element and the fact that the Judicial Network contact points are to provide the national members of Eurojust with certain information .
Consumer safety is of even greater importance when it aims to safeguard the authenticity of medicinal products sold on the open market , whether through traditional channels or over the Internet .
The available data show that some countries are affected to a greater extent than others by the gathering pace of global warming .
We talk a lot about national and international economies , but the local economy is crucially important : people 's access to banking , even if they are not very well off , to microcredit and to credit unions .
Transatlantic economic cooperation is not directed against anybody .
Paragraph 4 of the resolution asks the Government - the very same Sri Lankan Government - to investigate their own serious human rights violations .
At this time of economic crisis , when the fight against tax fraud is all the more important given the seriousness of loss of revenue , we must make every effort to combat it , as this will have an important impact not only on our response to the current international crisis , but also on the possibility of pursuing the appropriate social policies .
( PL ) Mr President , I think that this is a unique coincidence , because I am going to speak about the very same topic .
The Commission 's Green Paper refers mostly to a smoke - free environment , and the debate mainly focused on that area .
The multitude of reasons and proposed political solutions are contained in the opinion of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality .
( PT ) The pressure being exerted by the Commission and the great powers of Europe on the countries with more fragile economies and higher levels of poverty flies in the face of all the principles of economic and social cohesion that the Belgian Presidency has spoken about here in the name of the so - called ' social clause ' of the Treaty of Lisbon - Article 9 .
In the EU , women are still severely under - represented in decision making , caring responsibilities fall almost entirely on women 's shoulders and there is still a persistent income gap between men and women , including outside the EU , where some countries have not even begun working on giving women the franchise .
It is not acceptable for women to be subjected to bullying and physical or psychological violence on a daily basis .
I listened very carefully to the comments by Mr Degutis .
I would like to underline once again , that easy access by petitioners to the information they need should be the foundation for the success of the European transparency initiative .
The struggle against inequality in and outside the workplace is a fundamental task for us .
If the EU were to maintain relations only with countries that respect human rights as we defend them , then our firm relations would extend to only a few countries .
Preparation of the European Council ( 11-12 December 2008 ) ( debate )
in writing . - I welcome this report as an important step forward in the battle against dementia .
We must respect both .
The Commission must manage the interconnection of these systems and expand their functionality in order to streamline costs .
This is an important venture but , at the same time , I would like to take this opportunity of stressing that there are , in fact , national centres , and also numerous European colleges with experience in training personnel .
All the Member States should benefit from the boost and the resulting recovery , whilst not all of them can contribute to the same extent because their starting situations are different .
Pierre Werner , a former Prime Minister of Luxembourg , along with Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut Schmidt , when they were still Finance Ministers , submitted blueprints heading in this direction .
Members of the Council , I ask you therefore to note that not merely the new Member States are involved .
( FR ) Madam President , as a result of the austerity policy conducted by the Cameron government , the United Kingdom has just decided to stop funding the large tugboats designed to assist and rescue ships in the English Channel , a unilateral decision that has been condemned by the port , maritime , trading and political bodies of that area .
Why ?
Particular attention must therefore be given to protecting intellectual property .
President of the Commission . - Mr President , let me complement Prime Minister Reinfeldt 's assessment of the European Council by commenting on two aspects , one on policy and one on institutional issues .
The Commission is currently carrying out research and fact - finding on information to consumers at the point of sale , and it intends to consult retail experts , consumer organisations and other stakeholders on the ground before proposing concrete measures .
On the one hand , we are talking about a community with a common destiny .
Some Members have referred to the social clause , proposal 29 , and I think that proposal 30 is very important .
At times of crisis , capital looks for low - risk areas , and there is the chance to invest in new greenfield technologies rather than in unviable industries .
Let me ask you this : when , if not now , should this action be initiated ?
We wanted , in this way , to underline the importance we place on the fight against intolerance based on belief or religion .
In conditions such as that , which will become ever more frequent as a result of global warming , the local resources were stretched to the limit , despite the fact that , in previous years , the weather was milder and Corsica had been spared .
I hope that the European Parliament 's decision will be approved by the Council and that the new provision will even enter into force this year .
But , as President Sarkozy said yesterday here in Parliament , we need to maintain our domestic sources of food .
Today we want to hear how the outgoing Czech Presidency sees the past six months and what conclusions and principal comments it has about what we should do in the near future .
Commissioner , your diagnosis of a lack of interconnection could not be more accurate .
It is unfortunate that indifference is particularly great in Central and Eastern European countries , the roots of which is once again to be sought in the inadequacy of information , but another contributing factor is that the pace of catching up after the great wave of enlargement has slowed down and caused disappointment .
Europe is still not a whole and our fundamental objective is to take this process on .
We all agree , but the efforts must be joint or not at all .
How many times must it be said in this House that , because it nourishes people , because it helps to make the countryside more attractive and to keep populations in rural areas , agriculture cannot be considered as an economic activity like any other ?
However , we regret , Commissioner , that the action plan contains too few practical measures .
Explanations of vote
In slaughterhouses , official inspectors perform food safety controls , mainly on carcasses .
As more than fifteen Members have asked for the floor , we are going to hear the first five .
I am particularly pleased that the EU has now introduced energy labelling of domestic appliances .
The first is that if there is no legislative initiative , if the Council and the Commission do not bring legislative acts to fill up the programme , then obviously the programme cannot succeed .
I would expect you to talk about the social agenda , and the social failing that was conspicuous by its absence from the summit discussion : the 70 million poor , 20 million of whom are children .
Today we can talk of the traditional and folk culture in historically undeveloped regions , but we cannot say very much about their existence in developing regions .
Violence and hatred cannot be accepted in the name of religion .
Vice - President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me give warm thanks to Mrs Angelilli for this report .
Tomorrow I think there is an opportunity for Parliament to show that we not only sing our own arias of regret and anger and play the blame game , but we can make a real contribution constructively to establish leadership and pick up on very concrete proposals that the European Commission could immediately initiate .
Our involvement has always been in line with the principle of solidarity , but also of responsibility .
We cannot separate respect for a better balance between the principle of protecting health and safety from that of equality of treatment .
In the EU , we kill over one and a half million children before birth every year .
The next item is the report by Mrs Gebhardt , on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , on implementation of the Services Directive [ ( 2006/123 / EC ) .
This is not just about mandatory national requirements , but about specific projects .
We will continue to firmly and vehemently oppose arguments for the irrational criteria of the Stability Pact , and for exchange policy guidelines and other macro - economic guidelines , as well as the devaluing of production and labour - in which Vítor Constâncio has played a central role - as we have always done .
in writing . - ( SV ) We welcome the fact that the resolution demands an immediate stop to Israel 's killing of the inhabitants of Gaza .
Ireland has not ratified .
I hope that the message is not that if alcohol is drunk in small quantities , no amount will prove harmful .
This is a most fundamental point .
Despite this , women are still not worth as much as men - either when it comes to pay or influence - both in society and in the workplace .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it would seem that some groups are very sure that it is right for us now to seek a very ambitious free trade agreement with Japan .
Mr Davis , at its meeting last Wednesday , the Euro - Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly , which I myself chaired , adopted a resolution on the tragic situation in the Middle East .
Since yours is a small country , you might be able to diagnose why we never arrive at solutions .
We have therefore chosen to support the report .
in writing . - I voted for this uncontroversial report , which endorses the proposal for a regulation on the conclusion of a new Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Mozambique .
It is because governments have a feeling that , if everything was said clearly , and if the citizens of EU Member States knew the consequences , if they knew the reasons why we want to make such important decisions , the uncertainty of those reasons and the uncertainty of the consequences of our actions , they would be opposed to it all .
Coordination between the various policy areas and levels of management along with the involvement of the private sector are crucial for the effective implementation of these measures .
It also seeks to promote the development of filtering systems and to encourage the labelling of Internet sites deemed safe for children .
I have already mentioned the Energy Community Treaty , and we will also use the existing mechanisms within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy .
In the context of the overall developments , the EU 's common agricultural policy appears very inflexible and rigid .
I would therefore be most interested to know how you managed to converse with him , Mr President .
As Foreign Minister at the time when visa requirements for Bulgaria were lifted , I know the great emotional effect the visa waiver and ending of humiliation had on our citizens .
On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , however , I would like to say that , in any case , we still have the goal of establishing a common , EU - wide asylum system by 2012 .
Scientific cooperation with Africa ( debate )
Our fellow citizens , however , wish to see a Europe that provides solutions to the challenges of globalisation .

During yesterday 's vote in the European Parliament , I voted in favour of the resolution on the climate change conference in Cancún ( COP 16 ) .

I would like to start with that because it has been a unique experience for me .
The Commission should table a proposal amending the regulation in terms of the management structures of the European GNSS programmes .

However , call a spade a spade !

I voted in favour of the own - initiative report by my German fellow Member Mr Piecyk on an Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union , drawn up in response to a Communication from the Commission on the same subject .
Despite problems , I believe that there are already channels for dialogue which can prove very useful .
Furthermore , I believe that the next steps must be far more effective and tougher on the part of both the European Commission and the Czech Presidency .
( NL ) Mr President , the only reason - at least the way I see it - to look seriously at this proposal at all is that it creates a European framework for Member States to work within , which ultimately benefits the internal market .
This means that the current legislation may not be up to date .
Small and medium - sized enterprises are the engine and the main players in the current economic recovery .
We need to ask for more commitment , in particular from the big emerging economies , China , India and Brazil , always within the framework of the World Trade Organisation .
If we can include this in the process that we are now celebrating , the five years since expansion , then we will be ready for further processes and for the future .

Developing countries are facing difficulties establishing tax systems ( the establishment , collection and administration of taxes ) .

We call for the removal of obstacles to the mutual recognition of qualifications and the modernisation of our European universities with financial backing from the EU .

That would honour the person that he is : committed to the peaceful transformation of China ; a literary critic , teacher and author , who has always sought to bring freedom of expression and democracy to China through the world of ideas and words .

The European institutions and the Turkish authorities should learn from this wisdom at long last .
Europe absolutely has to help us protect these human lives which are ended every year .
In times of crisis , there is no point merely writing figures in the budget , but instead we should build a useful budget , immediately ready for action .
It must be made clear and I believe it really is important .
That is where there is much more confidence among citizens .
However , so that Europe remains competitive in respect of other global players , the funding of research projects must be massively expanded , especially in the field of the new energy sources .

I miss the Small Business Act .
I hope they will come through on this .
All the lines proposed by the Commission were reinstated - many thanks for that .
I feel that all of their contributions shed some much - needed light on the report .
- ( CS ) In September last year I warned on YouTube and elsewhere against the growing incidence of hazardous toys and I promised that we would take measures here to ensure that by Christmas the market would be a safer place .
We currently are lacking the accurate statistical data that we need to assess the situation .
Taking the European average , the income gap sets men and women 17.8 % apart .
It is for this reason that the EU strategy for this region will certainly have a very positive impact on the area and on the EU as a whole .
Madam President , I often take questions for Mr Mitchell , my colleague .
The Committee on Social Affairs has adopted a set of common indicators for the process of social protection and integration , which will ensure comparability of data .
Firstly , cohesion policy is important as an instrument for ensuring the balanced development of the European Union , with any attempt to re - nationalise these policies being rejected .
Yes , this cooperation will take place .
I am pleased that the issue of employers who benefit at the expense of illegal immigrants has been raised for discussion by the European Parliament .
It has also been said , however - and there are studies demonstrating it - that by 2050 , these costs may have increased to 7 % of gross domestic product , but the return from investment in preserving biodiversity is 100 times greater .
The European Union will thus be well equipped to react rapidly should the need for further balance of payments support arise .
In my own country , for example , the funds we received in the last year were twice what we would previously have received in two years .
Unfortunately , it appears that the Commission will not manage to prepare the draft regulation in time , and , what is worse , will not have the funds to change it .
It is therefore an entirely political resolution , with no basis in fact .
Their work is important .
It is , however , true that job creation is falling behind .
President Obama is currently attempting - I wish him well - to introduce a national health care system , which we have practically everywhere in Europe , with some differences .
We need to take action on the causes of inflation .
This is therefore one more piece in a complex policy that must be pursued and developed .
This is the direction that things are going .
It is a state that requires international assistance , a delegation from the European Commission , the extension of the UN mission and support from all of us for any initiatives that might help to promote unity among the East Timorese people , with respect for the law and condemning all violence .
This means that we must enable the creators to distribute their work as widely as possible , without any fear of abuse from the middlemen or the consumers .
Another issue is how European producers - farmers - can be competitive when in the European Union we have different , higher , standards of animal welfare in relation to the environment , which are not addressed at the WTO . You will only bring our citizens with you on this journey if those issues are addressed at the WTO .
I am sure that we see it as an ongoing process .
The reforms of the judiciary are based on international precedents and international best practice .
While we welcome the recognition of the need to create quality jobs , resource lifelong learning , upskill and train workers on an ongoing basis , and have particular strategies to include younger workers and women , we regret that the commitments are vague and that there is an absence of concrete targets in those areas .
This economic crisis is here .
Moreover , let us not forget that , in order to dissuade economic operators from acting illegally , it is important to take action both in terms of penalties against those who deliberately put dangerous or non - compliant products on the market , and in terms of transparency : any ban on products should be published .
It took a lot of strength and courage and great diplomacy to find a peaceful solution to the difficulties which we faced .
My political group , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , welcomes the result of today 's vote on the Catherine Neris report on harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products .
As I mentioned already , I am happy that we were able to find a compromise that we could all agree on .
Finally , the new media channels , relayed in Europe and worldwide , do indeed need funding , but must also be used responsibly ( for example the status of weblog authors and editors should be defined ) and greater media literacy should be encouraged throughout Europe .
What action will the Commission take against Lithuania , then , and what will it do about Romania , for example , whose legislation specifically excludes recognition ?
I think it is very helpful for all of us in the two institutions to understand each other .
There is still some way to go , and I urge both sides to make the last effort to reach an agreement capable of being approved by the Parliament before Christmas .
I think that we should not keep an unsustainable model so at a certain moment , we have to come back to sustainability .
And , amid this chorus of praise that will certainly appease the French Government from tomorrow , I believe that we need to take an interest , first and foremost , in workers who are going to be required to work even more , without really having any choice in the matter , such as all those in France who are in future going to be asked to work on Sundays .
I have voted in favour of the report on the demographic challenge , but against the paragraph which calls on the Member States ' to give consideration to regulated labour migration ( immigration from third countries into the EU ) ' .
The United Nations presence on the ground , in the form of the United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire ( UNOCI ) , has been unable to protect civilians .
Mr President , may I add a personal remark .
It also takes a very great deal of creativity and innovation to assemble funding packages .
8 .
The debate is closed .
In this case , the Commission has not only the right , but also the duty , to voice its opinion .
The Copenhagen Summit is a real challenge to which we must rise and we must not allow the industrial and nuclear lobby to be the glorious victors .
In essence , this is a totalitarian programme .
The group consists of 27 representatives from the administrations of Member States , from the research community , from the European enabling technology sector , from the European Investment Bank and from associations of small and medium - sized enterprises .
We also welcome the reference to the ILO Conventions on the concept of decent work and stress that these standards must play an integral role in economic cooperation , investment and trade relations , in particular in combating child labour , which continues to be a most serious problem in those countries , especially Tajikistan and Uzbekistan .
We work from the point of view that interdependence in energy supply is the most important thing and is beneficial for all - for suppliers , transit countries and consumers .
These are the topics I have attempted to add to the text of the report , so that a serious debate can be opened on the issues .
( The speaker stops )
( NL ) Mr President , Mr President - in - Office of the Council , President Barroso , Commissioner Almunia , I , too , wish to focus on the EU 2020 strategy , as the need for Europe to work for its citizens and their jobs is greater than ever in these times of crisis .
I have worked on it seriously ; I have not been ideological or biased , and I have taken account of all the obstacles and been anxious to make progress .
President of the Commission . - I have to remind you that it was the Commission that launched the climate change and energy package and that we have highlighted the great potential for the creation of jobs in some sectors of the so - called greening of the economy and that , certainly , the priority for the future is such , one of the most important targets of the EU 2020 .
I also object to the gratuitous and unnecessary references to the Treaty of Lisbon , which Conservatives and many others have consistently opposed .
That means before 9 May .
I would like to mention two examples .
Facility providing mid - term financial assistance for Member States ' balances of payments (
Thank you for your support on this matter .
Nonetheless , it does not provide a harmonised framework on the contents and the quality of non - promotional information for patients .
Madam President , on the Breyer report , I say to the Commission , why are you against an impact assessment ?

In spite of apparent sufficiency of supplies , a significant proportion of the world 's population cannot afford the basic food it needs , and accessibility of food remains a key issue to be dealt with urgently .
Ladies and gentlemen , a look at the situation of European Union maritime transport can lead to ambivalent conclusions .
Maximum support from the Slovenian Presidency in fulfilling all the priorities of its programme is essential for handling these matters appropriately , including the creation of the preconditions for Croatian and Turkish accession .
( DE ) Mr President , as I was addressed personally , I would actually like to respond for a minute under the catch - the - eye procedure .
These amendments will ensure consumers greater security , and will contribute to companies , small or large , being able to provide goods and services without unnecessary legal obstacles .
Responsibility , honesty and transparency are required - and no games of hide and seek or cat and mouse by the Member States and the finance ministers .
For this reason , I feel able to endorse the report by voting in favour .

I am happy to confirm that the Commission strongly supports Parliament 's overall approach .
But it is important , as we move towards reforming the common agricultural policy , that we continue to make those improvements .
Two EU countries , Poland and Denmark , are responsible for negotiating a post - Kyoto agreement .
On the one hand , there is heavy rainfall accompanied by flooding , while on the other , periods of drought that devastate entire swathes of Europe are becoming more frequent .
6 .
I just think we need information , because if we do not get this information on injuries or effects on health , I believe it may be difficult to get consumers on board in this fight to do something about product counterfeiting .
I have no doubt Google wish to uphold their famous motto ' Do no evil ' .
Nevertheless , if we are to defend it , we must accept that the social model will have to change in order to meet the new challenges and adapt to the new world of globalisation and the information and knowledge society .
As European politicians , we should always strive to put the citizens at the centre of our policy .
Change is inevitable in the dairy sector , but there needs to be a well managed transition to provide the farmers of Europe with a stable and bright future .
We propose promoting the free movement of researchers , students and scientists and adopting a unified regime on the protection of intellectual property rights .
Thirdly , increased gas storage capacity is crucial for the operability of the solidarity mechanism .
It must not be forgotten that anti - communism was the ideological cement of several fascist dictatorships and a factor used by them to divide democratic forces .
I therefore think that this is an excellent solution .
Why is this ?
The agreements make provision for monitoring and reviews that will involve Parliament .
Mr President , I think it is important to remember that this is not the first time we have talked about Belarus in this Parliament , and from that point of view , this resolution is important insofar as it clearly condemns the arrests and imprisonment of members of the opposition and the violation of fundamental rights to which these people have been subjected .
I voted in favour of this report .
We are working on that in order to facilitate such an agreement .
In the case of Bulgaria and Romania , it is 2014 .
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the new EU action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The vote will take place tomorrow .
The debate lost its dynamism because the shadow rapporteurs were not allowed to speak either .
( ES ) Madam President , Commissioner , today 's debate is vital so that we can express our concern about the crisis in the milk sector .
This prize embodies freedom of thought , an essential European freedom and right we stand for on behalf of our citizens and across the world .
In some countries work on the necessary legislation has been going on since 2004 and has still not been finalised .
This is a typical leftist method of solving crime problems - by banning everything and everyone and , what is more , for 30 years .
The most glaring , gaping hole in the proposal is that it does not actually prohibit the import and sale of illegally logged timber - perverse as that sounds .
Similarly , Mrs Muscardini , you will always have my support when it comes to defending the food sovereignty of the European Union .
Following on from what many Members have said , I wish to emphasise the stabilising role of enlargement .
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes
We should make no mistake : the entire treaty - based non - proliferation system with the NPT as a cornerstone is under growing pressure .
I have one brief comment for my British colleagues : as I understand it , there has only ever been one referendum held in Great Britain , namely on accession to the Community .
The rule in my own county , Sweden , is that , unless they have young children together , it is enough for people merely to give notice of the divorce .
I think it is a question of whether vulnerable ecosystems exist above this figure and not just below it , as some colleagues have questioned .
I hope it will do that .
( Applause )
The first is that , today or tomorrow , in tandem with today 's debate , the Greek Parliament will be voting on a legislative initiative by the Greek Government which makes it easier and more flexible to acquire Greek nationality than in the past .
We talk about citizens ' rights very often in Parliament - about the right to choose , the right to obtain accurate and correct information .

I too have therefore backed the report of Mr Schmitt , which attempts to identify potential problems in the area of education that must be tackled .
in writing . - I welcome Jens Holm 's report on trade in raw materials and commodities .
The Commission also systematically checks the ability of the Member States ' competent inspection authorities to ensure compliance with food legislation , both within and outside the EU .
Let me put it in straightforward terms : this flexibility is already available under the current Directive , but it is not being applied by all the Member States .
Reopening this debate could be dangerous and unnecessary , and could cause problems with the movement of products .
The amendment concerned is apparently technical and arises from the difference in interpretation of the Council and of the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other with regard to the applicability of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to multiannual indicative programmes .
Destabilisation attempts are merely bringing them losses .
Such a code is needed for reasons beyond simply harmonising the actions taken by Member States .
If this is carried tomorrow by Parliament , then I hope the Commission will disregard it entirely because I regard this as completely irresponsible .
On the other hand , we also need to create intelligent networks .
One observer referred some months ago to this unfolding crisis as like watching a train crash in slow motion .
The proper management of reservoirs has been replaced by cost - cutting negligence by United Utilities , leading to safety margins being ignored and a panic - stricken decision to open sluice gates and release a man - made deluge on the town .
Then prove it !
Commissioner , in building the Single Market , you want political and not merely economic foundations .
I must express my serious concerns about the attempts by the Belarusian authorities to place in state custody Danil Sannikov , the three - year - old son of Andrei Sannikov , presidential candidate , and of Irina Khalip , investigative journalist , both held since the elections on 19 December .
President Barroso came here not long ago to give a State of the Union address , and I think we should remind him of this , clearly stating the Union 's strategy with regard to the financial market .
Nobody can argue with that , but the question is : on whose terms ?
It is true that the review aims to improve SMEs ' access to financing , but it fails to mention social and environmental issues and does not even refer to the European Commission 's plan for a Social Business Initiative , announced for the end of this year .
To achieve this , the Commission , in fact , published two studies , and one year ago in this House , a resolution was approved on the same subject .
It is important not only that the European Union is united on this but also that it should play a similar role to that which we played in involving other countries on other continents in order to achieve the universal moratorium on the death penalty .
That is the new idea , and , for the Members on the right , this is one of the good ideas that Mr Sarkozy in France had ; it was called the Grenelle , or round table , on the environment .
Minister , you are very well aware that 32 countries already produce these NPIs including , I am delighted to say , France , and the Czech Republic , who will be holding the presidency of the Council from January .

I was really positively surprised by the interest in enhancing regional integration , and cooperative attitudes also towards the forthcoming negotiations of an association agreement .
That is why I am proud to be telling Parliament today and tomorrow that the PSE Group has made a compromise , following tough negotiations - which is as it should be on such an important matter - with the ALDE and PPE - DE Groups .
As you know , we are currently conducting further consultations on the exact form and content of the proposal , the results of which will then be incorporated into the impact assessment to be completed in the first months of next year .
When we know how we think , we know how we can also act together in the end .
It is a clear sign of the willingness of the European Parliament to move towards a European legal framework for legal immigration .
Nevertheless , Libya has expanding commercial and political relations with EU Member States , and the country is strategically important for the EU .
( ES ) Madam President , I am going to talk about the renewed social agenda .
If enterprises are to remain capable of innovation , they need to invest a lot of money - which is often a problem , particularly in view of the credit crunch .
Ladies and gentlemen , the lesson we should indeed learn from this accident is the urgent need to strengthen security measures .
To reiterate , I agree with the rapporteur , who is of the opinion that Member States should be given more time to investigate whether repealing the directives will lead to legal uncertainty which makes European harmonisation of rules necessary .
We support this amendment to the regulation and we hope that this Parliament will give its full support to this worthwhile proposal .
We must take relevant action instead of merely toasting our European enterprises .
Two existing directives on hazardous waste and on waste oils were repealed and their provisions transferred to the Waste Framework Directive .

It is estimated that by the year 2020 , depression will have become the most common illness in the developed world and the second main reason for incapacity for work .
I voted for the resolution in the conviction that , during the period that immediately follows , the specific measures aimed at improving the situation of the Roma population will be put into practice rather than remain fine statements .

Mr Schulz is right : Israel needs to be protected from itself !
A social pact that is able to clearly state that this time , Europe is going to make a commitment to financial and environmental sustainability , and also to preserving the social model that made us better when it made us Europeans .
How will we achieve these tasks ?
All these imitation products must be labelled as such .
We have introduced action plans through which the individual countries are to achieve both a qualitative and quantitative reduction in the use of pesticides .
We cannot turn our backs on Belarus .
For my part , I voted in favour of Mrs Ross ' nomination .
I believe that the solidarity between all European countries represented by the European Commission is absolutely fundamental in this case .
in writing . - Recent events have raised questions about the nature of our relations in both the short and the long term .
Following SME - friendly procurement policies and allowing SMEs to participate in public / private partnerships will be a start .
A little bit earlier I touched briefly on the issue of memory : it plays an important role in matters of identity ; it teaches us not to repeat the tragedies of the past .
By joining the efforts of law enforcement and civil society , particularly at the local community level , it is possible to achieve better results in implementing and further developing the EU Drugs Strategy .

( Applause )
That is why the Commission 's opinion is positive regarding this reform of the Treaty .
The workshop in Stockholm on increasing access to employment focused on how to get the newly unemployed and the inactive into - or back into - jobs as quickly as possible .
However , I would like to add that many measures which need to be taken now regarding competitiveness and public finances are measures that national governments ought in fact to have taken , even without European pressure .
Hopefully , that will change with the new government .
We will also be adopting this legislation in record time , showing that European laws can move at the same speed as the TGV .
The next item is the debate on the European Council report and Commission statement - Results of the European Council ( Brussels , 13-14 March 2008 ) .

For its perpetrators , criminal organisations involved in prostitution and sexual exploitation , illegal adoption , forced labour , illegal immigration and illegal trafficking of organs , it is an extremely lucrative activity .
( HU ) Mr President , for years , a serious , recurring problem with our budget has been the significant gap between the funds committed and the actual payments made .
I also admire the concept that you have produced .
The debate this evening has been triggered by media reports in one particular Member State - Germany .
Its recitals detail the numerous human rights violations being perpetrated in that country today , but they omit to recall that a Marxist - inspired and then military regime has been oppressing its people for decades , with support from China as is well known .
This is how the scandal is developing in Greece , the scandal in which , further to confessions and convictions by German courts , state officials have been involved and included , officials who , for years , were bribed with its dirty money to award an unknown number of procurement and works contracts to Siemens .
So it was important for us that the EU approach be followed and the principle of non - discrimination be respected in the new legislation through the inclusion of a prohibition on the introduction of new safety marks other than CE .
We will work so that the ratification and application of the new Treaty do not leave aside the fact that the path towards a truly free , open and democratic Europe is not over and that this is only a small stage , and is not even that glorious .
Accordingly , export restrictions and discrimination against products are prohibited , and free trade must be guaranteed , although there are exceptions for measures in the interests of safety .
This responsibility has also been expressed through the replies made by the Commissioner , the commitments made and reiterated through the various evaluation meetings arranged for February and June 2011 .
We cannot wait until all the bees have died out because the problem will be incredibly serious .
The same appears to be true with some of the smaller market regulations in the plant sector , such as , for example , the market regulations for potato starch , dry green fodder or rice , on which a regionally significant processing industry depends and has invested a great deal in recent years and has to service this with high interest rates .
Capital has the ability to respond flexibly and is very mobile .
We will see what measures President Obama puts in place to counter the crisis in the US motor industry .
That is also extremely important .
It is clear - those were the conclusions of the G 20 - that a global effort will be needed to relaunch the global economy .

My own Member State , Belgium , has set up the European Carousel Network ( Eurocanet network ) that guarantees a spontaneous exchange of information .
There have not been many comments made here about that , but it is very important that Iran becomes a constructive player and not a ' nuisance ' in the lives of the people of the Middle East and in the establishment of peace in the Middle East , as we understand the development of the peace process in the Middle East .
In the same manner , tourism statistics represent a useful tool to support decision making in business and in the private sector .
This would make the measure non - discriminatory by demonstrating that the list of feedstock categories is open and that the Commission is actively looking at other categories and is ready to extend the list when enough evidence and data is gathered on other categories .
The European Parliament 's contribution was substantial in this matter .
I do not support the resolution because , despite the obvious deficiency of the progress made and the discrepancies with the acquis communautaire , it looks forward to accession that may take place , in my opinion , too soon .
However , even given the best possible national healthcare systems , there will still be cases where patients will need or want help , support and medical treatment from another country .
Finally , I wish to say that we tabled an amendment on the internal resettlement of refugees , which was not accepted .
I hope that Mr Cashman will accept our proposed amendments , particularly on greater financial transparency , and I believe that as the European Parliament , we should set a good example .
The debate is closed .
I would also like to underline the new principles of employment and payment , which will be transparent and meet the needs announced earlier of assistants and the end of the pension fund in its previous form .

The debate is closed .
I hope that the European Council will agree , either on 17 September or in October , that money should be provided to start works immediately , so that these countries can see that the European Union and the developed countries really mean what they propose and what they say .
The people of Campania told us the following very clearly last year : ' We have appealed to everyone for help and knocked on all manner of doors , here in our province and the region , across Italy and amongst the Italian Government , and everywhere , we came away empty - handed .
It is important , though , to introduce taxation which is relevant to the current circumstances since , in the UK for example , Barclays Bank only paid GBP 113 million in corporation tax in 2009 , at well below the UK rate of 28 % , while the Royal Bank of Scotland allocated EUR 25 billion to tax avoidance schemes that year and cost the British and US exchequer EUR 500 million in lost revenue .

At our request , a major study has already been conducted on the consequences of bankruptcy in the air transport sector , particularly those for passengers .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is clear that today we are debating a very delicate issue - one on which Parliament is divided - and at the same time a very sensitive , if not tragic issue , since it can potentially have fundamental consequences for the conditions of existence and even the lives of those seeking to come to Europe , even if illegally , in search of a future that their country cannot offer them .
I do not believe that an extra 2-3 % will be a huge burden , but it will show that we are taking serious steps to counter pollution .

The Council has not taken any specific action on this issue .
Mr President , as Mr Vondra has just pointed out , we now indeed have a legal framework which is beginning to assert itself .
Lastly , before I conclude , I have a question regarding a specific matter : a number of MEPs have received messages , which could be described as insistent , about Indonesia , all air carriers of which have been banned , requesting that we ask the Commission to take Indonesia off the blacklist .

The key point of this debate is not only the specific issue being tackled by the Committee on Petitions , with reference to the dissemination of German in relation to its use by Community institutions .
We want to maintain this agreement and help it to be fulfilled , but we also want this agreement to be used to benefit the development of Papua New Guinea and Fiji and not to damage the Spanish industry .
As the rapporteur said , under Article 10 of the new regulation , the Director will be appointed from a shortlist of at least three candidates submitted by the Commission .
The first category concerns the preparatory activities which have to be completed in order for the Lisbon Treaty , if and when enforced , to be implemented fully .
Volunteering also has economic value , and we must not forget this .
Easing visa restrictions , we are often told , has nothing to do with migration , by which they mean , of course , legal migration .
Farmers know what profits they make , how much they sell their products for , and they know how much they and other consumers pay for food .
Parliament and the Commission reached an agreement over two years ago to extend the scope of the Solidarity Fund so that it covers not just natural disasters but also industrial accidents , terrorist attacks and major public health crises .
I welcome Parliament 's amendment which goes some way to protect bees , which are crucial for farmers and food supplies through pollination .
You must contribute something to this , as must Croatia .
rapporteur . - Mr President , before highlighting a few elements of this elaborate report on the role of culture in the EU 's external actions , I want to sincerely thank my colleagues from the Committee on Culture and Education for their constructive collaboration and for unanimously adopting our joint work in the committee vote .
For the moment , then , I think you know that this approach appears to be disputed .
( For the results and other details on the vote : see Minutes )
Poland and Ukraine are linked by centuries of history as neighbours .
That really should not happen in Europe .
If we repeat the same old mistakes , our EUR 1 billion will only buy us the pretence of a market and competition .
in writing . - According to the Commission , every year , in the EU alone , an estimated 9.3 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment ( EEE ) are sold annually , the biggest share of which are large household appliances and IT and telecommunication equipment .
However , I would have liked it to be more ambitious - particularly as it concerns the future existence of viable fish stocks in our seas .
I congratulate the Commission on a number of steps that have been very positive .
In this context , it is important to promote the fight against impunity , but also to address the root causes of the problem .
We need it - and we shall prove it by the way we vote - to protect consumers .
This is borne out by the fact that it was the only country whose government , with a green environment minister , abstained from the approval in Council of the common position on the recent waste directive .
In this regard , we wish to introduce some innovations , including business - to - business and business - to - consumer contracts regulated by an optional instrument that would enlarge the parties ' choice , and the introduction of a monitoring and review mechanism in order to ensure that the optional instrument keeps up with market needs and legal and economic developments .
National spending should be transferred to the European budget in places where there are clear cost efficiencies , economies of scale and value added , and where market failure requires stronger European policies to correct it .
And , given the increase in the European Parliament 's powers envisaged in the Treaty of Lisbon , it is understandable that its Members should consider the institutional and procedural implications of the Treaty , hence tonight 's debate on the five reports .
It is a very worthwhile suggestion .
( PL ) Mr President , I hope that the understanding that was reached in Berlin concerning the most important problems currently inherent in the Reform Treaty will culminate in a positive outcome during the forthcoming summit in Lisbon .
We definitely do not want to erect new barriers - that is after all the main aim of Euro - Atlantic civilisation as a whole .
It must be a priority for the European Union , and we must make sure that there is close cooperation between the Member States and the European Commission .
Moreover , they have not taken account of the fact that , in the absence of a European directive , each Member State will impose its own rules on the matter .
Thank you , Parliament .
Where in the world does Europe count ?
I have followed this report closely , since volunteering has a major importance in current society .
We would not have been able to get energy projects off the ground as part of the recovery plan - for example , by linking electricity networks from the Baltic countries with those from the Nordic countries , or linking the gas network in Bulgaria with those of Western Europe , so that Russia is no longer able to cut off our heating - if we had not found the money for this in the agricultural budget .
I would now like to move on to the second point .
in writing . - ( FR ) The French Socialists have voted in favour of the Toubon report on the Single Market Review and its adaptation to the twenty - first century , since it refers to important aspects that are sometimes ignored when discussing the completion of the Single Market .
There will be no genuine reconciliation without exposing the war crimes which were committed , irrespective of which side it was that committed them .
The disagreements about a European External Action Service , too , are something that we cannot really afford .
These texts are anything but a Trojan horse for the graduated response , and even oppose the very principle .
The ODA quota must be even stricter than in the current DCI .
I disagree : the State should not take a back seat , it should intervene more , should carry out more supervision in economic matters .
It must be said that the White Paper on Sport published by the Commission in July , and the Action Plan relating to it , are a step in the right direction .
In my view , the simplification of the school milk regime is particularly to be welcomed .
It is precisely for this reason that support should go , for example , not only to major improvements in the quality and accessibility of education , but also to the relevance of education .
Your report calls on the Commission firstly to take better account of the impact of trade liberalisation and , secondly , not to be limited to the OECD principles in the fight against tax evasion and harmful tax competition .
This way , for example , agents for unblocking pipes and washing - up liquids would have the same classification and package labelling , with the result that consumers would not be able to distinguish between hazardous products and milder detergents .
However , I feel obliged to urge a note of caution .
We need to rethink our strategy here and to take decisive action to establish order .
That last issue , Guantánamo Bay , was one of the wrongs that badly damaged the moral authority of the United States around the world .
The aim is to guarantee that both the integration of equality and special equality measures will have prominence in future strategies .
And when you say ' never again ' , you are , once again , quite right .
A protective law only works if it is effectively applied .
Practically every one of us has , at least once this year , flown with an airline that did not exist three years ago .
For this reason we will have a conference in October on using renewable sources together with countries from the Mediterranean and the Gulf .
It was a huge mistake to allow Haradinaj , the Albanian guerrilla , to leave The Hague .
There is firstly the admission that the Lisbon Strategy objectives will not be achieved in 2010 .
( SK ) The problems associated with illegally - staying immigrants in the EU call for transparent , clear and just rules .
In my opinion , it is the wrong approach .
I realise that the current economic climate is not favourable to increasing social spending , but this is a good investment in our collective future , and it does not have the high costs that many are claiming it does .
We are sceptical towards this idea for several reasons : This post may create significant expenses which risk undermining the funding of consumer organisations .
According to the latest estimates , citizens , and thereby taxpayers , lose up to EUR 100 billion every year , perhaps even more .
How should we deal with President Assad ?
As I recently informed the IMCO Committee , this is no time for knee - jerk reactions .
in writing . - ( DE ) Today , an attempt is being made to assert economic interests by hook or by crook .
The Bureau 's working group on the Members ' Statute , of which I am a member , has done its job and has prepared the necessary measures , not in accordance with the wishes expressed in resolutions , but in accordance with Article 27 of the Members ' Statute published in the Official Journal on 7 October 2005 .
Under the fifth and sixth framework programmes , two specific projects were devoted to the development of a safe , efficacious bluetongue virus vaccination strategy .
What we need is another policy here in Europe too .
I support this contribution , as I also believe that this conference should foster coherent development policies by promoting measures in all areas - such as trade , fisheries , the environment , agriculture , climate change , energy , investment and finance - in order to provide strong support for the development needs of the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , to combat poverty , and to ensure decent incomes and subsistence .
At the beginning of the budget discussions , there were still several open issues and gaps which had not been funded .
I am in favour of streamlining European Union regulations , but not if you make it more bureaucratic , difficult to operate and unfavourable to industry .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to remind you what the Lampedusans want .
Before the European elections , we want to send people , especially fathers and mothers , a clear and definite signal that , in times of crisis , the concept of a social Europe will not be abandoned , and clearly state that we aim to invest in people , in future generations and in demographic change .
The report stresses that the multi - level approach must be applied horizontally in all EU policies .
Parliament did that , not the Commission , which had promised to do it .
This document therefore courageously identifies the need to increase the level of transparency and competition within the energy sector , while effectively protecting the consumer from the consequences of a closed and inflexible market .
However , the difference does not extend beyond the borders of the euro area , which might be assumed to be the case from an economic perspective .
Let us remember that there is a strong Catholic minority , which brings it closer to neighbouring Poland and the rest of Europe and makes the country a strategic ally with regard to the rest of eastern Europe .
Madam President , I am delighted that we are debating today the proposal to reform the directive on industrial emissions and I would like to specifically thank the rapporteur , Mr Krahmer , and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety for their excellent work on this dossier .
You can think what you like about Prime Minister Gyurcsány .
So it is not a blank cheque .
The signing of bilateral fisheries agreements between the EU and third countries guarantees access for EU fleets to sources of fish that are significant in quantitative and qualitative terms whilst , at the same time , channelling financial resources to these countries that often come to make up a large proportion of their budget available for pursuing policies in numerous areas , not just fisheries policy .
If opinion polls ought to be taken into account , as the rapporteur would like , put a stop to the negotiations for Turkey 's membership , because the majority of Europe 's citizens oppose it .
( Applause )
( The President cut off the speaker )
I feel this would have been a plus in this communication .
Better late than never , however .
My final point is this : Mr Schultz , the Commission President and the Commission are not our opponents .
We need to keep this matter alive in the European Parliament .
We need to realise that the disappearance of bees would amount to an unprecedented upheaval in the history of mankind .
The detailed analysis mentioned earlier is currently under way and I cannot predict what the results will be .
I hope that Parliament 's services , when advising the President of Parliament on any future reports , go for maximum transparency and publish as much as possible in the future .
And why ?
Therefore , all the attention should be directed at the public use of that money .
Secondly , it is also vital , of course , that the European Court of Auditors analyse these exercises in detail and provide the necessary documentation .
We cannot allow such a situation to continue .
Yes , there are other very important sources which have to be exploited as fully as possible , but the proposals are not the right place to address them .
The second point is that we also have to tackle the problem of the Greek debt .
An illustrious career as a barrister , journalist and then a politician in Portugal followed after he finished law school at university in his home town of Coimbra .
But on top of all this - and I very much welcome what the minister said - we impose stigma .
We can look at this in depth and analyse the situation because , of course , if we have more competition and more intensive traffic , we should address very seriously these social aspects as well .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like to draw attention to the International Transport Workers ' Federation ( ITF ) 's action week , which will be manifesting itself in Istanbul this weekend .
( Applause )
It would be absurd and incomprehensible .
For many years , car manufacturers have had a strong monopoly on spare parts ; this is a significant element of car design .
In view of the novel nature of this structure , ambitious provisions with regard to transparency and budgetary and financial accountability need to be applied .
The continuing political unrest is hampering efforts to begin reconstruction work and help victims , and is making the situation even worse .
As a result , the development of the common agricultural policy should continue to be aimed towards improved competitiveness and , in the long term , less market management .
( The sitting was closed at 23:40 )
The piece of nonsense is free services that some people dream of , access to everything for nothing .
It is hoped that the strategy will gain the backing of the European Council meeting at the end of October .
Mario Monti was clear in his recent work that the single market had stalled .
Such a system would aid the prevention , investigation and elimination of transgressions of both Community laws and national laws .
Consequently , I voted to reject the Commission 's legislative proposal .
Madam President , the original sin committed when this new country , namely Kosovo , was born involved the feeling , prevalent amongst the Serbian minority in Kosovo and Metochia , as well as in Serbia itself , that the new state , and the entire Muslim majority , were set against the Serbs .
In particular , consumers will be given a 14 day cooling - off period during which they can withdraw from the agreement without any consequences , which will help them to think over their decision .
That has been criticised by some Members of this Chamber because it provides funds for the President of Tunisia 's justice system .
The report also calls for efficient goods transport , including reliable loading and unloading systems to facilitate last - mile operations , acknowledging the need to promote the co - existence of mobility of people and goods .
I have taken note of the assessment of the report on the policy options presented in the Green Paper and the support for the innovative solution of an optional instrument , which means no harmonisation but giving consumers and businesses a choice of having a Europe - wide system .
Our report is intended to encourage the Commission to intensify its efforts to simplify the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) in a tangible way .
Drugs that are grown and produced in Afghanistan find their way onto the streets of Europe .
We now have some studies on the potential of tax incentives for energy and environmental purposes , and the Commission is preparing a proposal to amend the VAT directive to allow reduced rates of VAT to apply to certain environmentally - friendly goods and services .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I wish to thank Parliament for its work on this issue .
I would like to draw attention to the fact that Bulgaria can only partially accept the proposals to amend Regulation 1234 .
I should like to say a couple of words about the Treaty that has been referred to by the rapporteurs .
Who knows whether you know or pretend not to know that this schooling was entrusted , almost as a monopoly , to a few associations that were motivated not so much by the best interests of minors as by the availability of public money .
My country , Cyprus , is at the centre of one such problem , but I , like most people in this Chamber , realise that problems are not solved by conflict , but by peaceful negotiation .
However , there is always a dilemma in sending funds and resources to developing countries , to poor countries to help them develop .
The issue of the restriction of access to the labour market is directly related to the first principle suggested by the rapporteur , namely " European action against abusive practices in various types of non - standard contracts " .
The problem with the method is that we are making use of an artifice , for which we thank Mrs Fraga , which is that of the oral question , to talk about something that should really , after the Treaty of Lisbon , be a Parliamentary right .
2006 discharge : European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (
My second remark is that the short - term Operation Atalanta has already prevented several acts of piracy from taking place and apprehended a number of pirates , so within a month of deployment the effectiveness of the operation has already become apparent .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , by means of this short speech , I should like to show my disagreement with the possible suspension of duties in favour of Pakistan for some three years and across 74 tariff lines , almost all of them in the textile and clothing sector .
I voted for the directive because it is in line with my views on health protection .
For us , this leads to the precept of the unconditional protection of human dignity and the promotion of a dialogue of cultures , which have been guiding principles during my term of office .
However , in the Conference of Presidents , we asked for the two things to be kept separate : the urgent issues which we are discussing now , in other words , the imminent executions , and the question of the relationship between the European Union and China on economic , cultural , political and defence issues and in other areas .
Only 47 % of the electorate took part , and in Slovakia , which I represent here , the figure was as low as 11 % .
After the completion of the impact assessment I intend to submit to this Parliament in September a proposal that allows the continuation of this scheme but on a very solid basis for the future .
Typically engaged in maternity and their usual role of supporting other family members , women are undoubtedly disadvantaged in an agricultural context .
We should be clear that it would be fitting to consider a strategy for how to deal with this situation .
I do not imagine that Belarus will benefit from what is being offered under the Eastern Partnership without the prior re - legalisation of the Union of Poles in Belarus and the return of its property , and , in addition , without the release of political prisoners such as Andrei Bandarenko , Ivan Mikhailau and Arystom Dubski .
In this context , we need legal certainty and , therefore , an extension of the monopoly over a longer period .
The causes of the accident are not yet fully known and the technical investigation has been launched in accordance with the provisions of the EU Safety Directive .
It is true that the crisis in Greece is very serious , but we all well know that it may , unfortunately , spread .
At the same time , approximately 80 million European citizens are below the poverty threshold .
European gas consumers cannot be left at the mercy of monopolies .
I therefore call on the Commission to follow the recommendations of the Durnwalder report , in the Committee of the Regions , and to include in the assessment of European territories the energy issues and the production capacity of mountain regions in terms of renewable energy and passive construction .
The Bangladeshi authorities are not doing a lot to support the economy in the country , where food prices have risen by more than a third in recent months , and where a quarter of the territory is threatened by a constant risk of flooding and humanitarian disaster .
in writing . - I support this report which takes up the serious problem of female genital mutilation .
( Applause )
Maybe we could come to an agreement and you , with the Bureau and with the Vice - Presidents , could agree that this section , Question Time , is sacrosanct and that that will not be changed .
With regard to the post - 2013 regional policy , I endorse the idea of setting up intermediate regions , thereby enabling regions with a GDP between 75 % and 90 % of the EU average to receive real support , however , through finding suitable solutions .
Certain scientists believe that another cause for this phenomenon is the electromagnetic wave radiation emitted from mobile phones , which penetrates the bees ' navigation system , leaving them unable to return to the hive .
This is an historic moment : the Europe of health is being built , and cross - border healthcare will no longer be a risk , but an opportunity .
( LV ) Thank you , Mr President .
The report before us welcomes Iraq 's observer status at the WTO as a key step towards driving Iraq 's integration in the international economy and it looks forward to the EU - Iraq trade and cooperation agreement .
A twofold picture is emerging where agriculture and other major debit entries on the budget are concerned .
But , through the consumer market scoreboard , one of the main topics of our investigations will be prices and part of this basket will be about food prices .
Those who argue that all women should be paid the same as men for perceived similarities in the job description miss the point entirely that no individual is an economic unit .
I wish the citizens ' initiative all the best .
First , at European level , we have only one key thing we should do in order to increase competitiveness and that is the single market .
One of the results of the Iraq war has been Israel 's recognition of the fact that it is no longer the US 's sole ally in the Middle East .
I therefore hope that something is done soon to improve airport passenger services which , as in the case of Rome airport , are often unsatisfactory .
Where do we stand on this ?
I will pass on your complaint , and then perhaps you will be contacted about the matter .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Europe is the largest importer of produce from the developing world .
There is legislation in force which must be respected .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , against the backdrop of the current economic and financial crisis , this G 20 summit forces us to conclude that the first objective that we must achieve is that of making workers more employable .
The President - in - Office of the European Council ( in Edinburgh in December 1992 ) confirmed these imperatives .
Therefore , the subsidies still being given to transport , energy , and publicly owned businesses should be reduced so as to ensure free competition within the European internal market .
But could you elaborate more on the EUR 100 000 threshold ?
I believe that there is a need for us to continuously keep all those concerns and questions you have voiced here in relation to solidarity - concerns which pertain exactly to the poorest countries - on the agenda , and to look for joint solutions , but to give a green light to this banana trade agreement and the law repealing the previous agreement . I therefore ask the European Parliament to decide on expressing its consent to the banana trade agreement tomorrow .
I also believe that this regulation will ensure that the unscrupulous trade is stopped and that harmonised rules will be developed to change the whole internal market .
This is the work we have done , increasing the budget and improving local activities and EU - wide activities for the benefit of the associations .
The chair of the European Parliament election observation mission was Paweł Kowal .
Following the Ajka sludge accident , the Commission will take stock of the lessons learnt at European level and , in particular , the appropriateness and the correct implementation and enforcement of European environmental legislation ; the measures needed to make sure that the affected population and industry at risk are covered by appropriate insurance schemes ; and the way forward to strengthen European disaster monitoring and response capacity and enhance our instruments to express solidarity with our members and our citizens in moments of need .
When we look beneath the surface , therefore , the resources used are very often revealed to be on a more equal footing than the image created might suggest .
We also have to allocate more funds to the European participants in the programme .
First of all my message is very much to you , Mr Schulz , because I want you to remember what you argued here in this Parliament two years ago .
Subject : Initiatives by the Slovene Presidency regarding a new approach to neighbourhood policy and energy
Let me instead open a brief parenthesis to place the agreement with Korea in the wider perspective of the future of EU trade policy , as sketched out by the Commission in its communication of 9 November 2010 , and to recap the basic tenets of our policy line .
It sets out sound , transparent regulations on the authorities competent to consider international protection applications and guarantees that these applications are handled as quickly and efficiently as possible .
deputising for the author . - I would like to thank the Czech Presidency for the chairing of the committee and their views on this .
Most people , other things remaining equal , would prefer to remain with their own people in their own countries .
I am being told that the Presidency of the Council had not been informed that the debate was a joint debate on the European Neighbourhood Policy and the situation in Georgia .
But there is no certainty that the international carbon market will deliver EUR 38 billion a year in financial flow to developing countries .
It is obvious that in the current situation , when these businesses are in such need of funding and obtaining finance is so difficult , we must not take measures on their behalf , for example accounting guarantee exemptions , that cut their credits and therefore prevent them from having the means to operate .
They may be serious and scientifically correct .
My second point : I welcome President Obama 's commitment to diplomacy with the Islamic Republic of Iran .
This has given rise to feelings not only of surprise but also of displeasure within the European Parliament and , as the rapporteur , I have felt the same .
In Europe - and this is true in France and everywhere else - we are weighed down by too many administrative rules .
With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon , the distinction between compulsory expenditure and non - compulsory expenditure has been suppressed , which means that Parliament and the Council are becoming jointly responsible for all EU spending , and that they decide upon it together .
That can sometimes rather weaken our actions .
But the increase in demand for wilderness tourism puts pressure on the very same values that the tourists are seeking and can speed up the destruction of fragile ecosystems .
Basing itself on the overall outcome of these meetings , the Commission will compile the results , which will then serve as an input for the various Council configurations in May and June .
It is regrettable that , six years on , the new elites still cannot accept the Orange Revolution as a genuine expression of popular will .
It may also lead to the opening of a significant number of investigations in which the initial suspicions ultimately prove to be groundless .
After all , on the one hand we are in a position to control them , and on the other to ensure economies of scale .
But what is happening at EU level ?
However , the report fundamentally emphasises the role of vocational training in promoting entrepreneurship and the need to ' create an environment where enterprises can succeed , develop and grow ' , adding that ' to grow , they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments ' .
What are the new challenges ?
The Austrian police stopped a truck containing137 puppies .
I believe that , with a postponement , there would be a very good chance of reaching a broad consensus over the calendar for 2012 .
This will even apply to workers who are subject to the principle of equal treatment and who are covered by what Mrs Mathieu said .
The report responds to these threats by seeking a pro - active diplomatic role for the European Union .
The debate is closed .
The amendment to paragraph 2 , which should have been the one we took last time , is : ' Believes that a military victory over the LTTE , as envisaged by the Government of Sri Lanka , will not obviate the need to find a political solution in order to ensure a lasting peace ' .
Nevertheless , we would have preferred to see stronger provisions on warnings on spirit bottles and on the risks of alcohol use by women during pregnancy .
Admittedly , we must strengthen the Growth and Stability Pact and deficits must be more closely monitored , and even penalised .
Mr President , the vote today on the Romeva report should , I hope , reassure European anglers that their concerns have been recognised .
Well , then , both the Cortés Lastra report and my report on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development concern policy synergy with a view to increasing output , or results , for Europe .
I see that as the best way to obtain the support of the G - 77 .
Thank you , Mr President .
However , it is clear that the casualty figures claimed by the LTTE have been exaggerated .
( PT ) One thousand is the number of the day , one thousand deaths to teach a black lesson .
It has also not been possible as yet to agree on a common position between safety experts , aircraft manufacturers , airlines and market regulators .
A way forward in terms of free and equal access to healthcare services for all citizens would be to scrutinise public contributions to treatment in private hospitals and tax credits for private health insurance .
We should not disregard this severe breach from the ideals of democratic elections .
The whole country has been in a state of emergency for 18 months and there are no free elections on the horizon .
The Commission is therefore committed to ensuring a prompt follow - up to the Transport Council conclusions as adopted on 4 May 2010 .
I have just noticed that the computer cloned me , because my name , the Tabajdi name , appeared for my colleagues who had cards inserted .
in writing . - ( PT ) It is well - known that , in July 2006 , the Commission presented a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides , together with a proposal for a directive establishing a framework for Community Action to achieve a sustainable use of pesticides and a proposal for a regulation concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market , with the aim of reducing the general risks and negative impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment .
It has to do with the fact that my voting machine malfunctioned in the vote on amendment motions 34 and 35 .
The Commission fully shares this position .
Let us be honest , once again .
I voted for this report because it calls on the Council and the Commission to rapidly review and strengthen the Action Plan according to the recommendations in this report and to ensure its swift implementation , given that CBRN accidents or attacks pose serious threats to the security of the people living in the European Union and can disrupt critical infrastructures and the normal functioning of societies in one or more EU Member States without any respect for borders .
Because of the traditional division of roles and the weak infrastructure in many areas , such as child care , for example , many women never feature in the official labour market , but at the same time they are not registered as unemployed .
Both reports ultimately stress the positive impact of this measure .
The amendments proposed : placing the EU at the forefront of these technologies , guaranteeing priority support for long - term research , supporting the rules for use and dissemination being adapted to those for participation in FP 7 , strengthening the Scientific Committee with the function of setting the scientific priorities and preventing the regulation from requiring the consortium coordinator to come from an industrial group , are issues that strengthen the Commission 's proposal .
As the coordinator from the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I would simply like to confirm that we support in every single dossier tabled before us one of the most important items for us , namely , the protection of jobs and the creation of new jobs .
Unfortunately , many states have not yet implemented the Eurovignette 1 infrastructure payments and , most likely , these same states will be very tardy in implementing Eurovignette 2 .
This place is getting to look more like a university students ' union than a Parliament , Madam President , and I hope you will take action to stop it .
The Irish Government has published a recent report concluding that , so far , no adverse short - or long - term health effects have been found .
The first of these areas is transport .
My question to the Council was identical to this , but Question Time with the Council has now been cancelled , without a replacement .
We have set a standard for future agreements .
As a matter of fact , in 2004 , Parliament sought the annulment of the agreement with the US before the European Court of Justice .
3 .
These four basic priorities of my group are :
It is not enough to talk about supervision and regulation .
In sports and politics alike , we have to get used to the fact that one or two influential or central politicians may try to sway decisions and results , but actual outcomes are determined by concerted teamwork , dedication and fair play .
Protection of the rights of the child as an internal and external objective of the European Union was included in the Lisbon Treaty .
author . - ( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , initially , we did not wish Parliament to consider right now the situation in Burundi , for , as you know , the Burundian authorities are currently negotiating with the FNL , the National Liberation Forces ; they have reached a critical stage which is finally presenting a positive outlook and which should , we hope , lead to the practical implementation of the agreements entered into in Dar es Salaam that aim to put an end to the fighting , violence and insecurity affecting the country .
6 .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal currently on the table is to be welcomed .
Is it simply that those opposing them did not accept the benefits of trade liberalisation , which I do , and just wanted to keep protectionism ?
We , or I , therefore ask you to think about whether a directive would be necessary for regulating this important area .
However , the Communist Party of China recognises only one charge , only one monotonously repeated charge , and that is of criminal separatism .
Subject : European Monetary Fund
I congratulate the Council for getting their act together and taking decisive action .
I voted in favour of the report by my colleague Mr Casaca because it clearly underlines the perverse effects of the current system , which sometimes causes decisions to be taken that are disconnected from local realities .
This has allowed the execution of people without trial .
The Parliament will support you on that .
My second point is about the common External Action Service .
However , until this was verified and for purely precautionary reasons , all consignments were regarded and treated as potentially contaminated .
The energy strategy has become both part of Europe 's foreign and security policy and a question of security of supply .
It is therefore also crucial that everyone contributes by quickly and effectively implementing the EU legislation that has to transposed into national law .
That is why we set up REACH .
Securing human rights and democracy must be the priority of the External Action Service and an unequivocal criterion in bilateral agreements with third countries .
in writing . - ( PL ) Croatia has made successful efforts to overcome existing divisions and to achieve unity between peoples , which is one of the aims of European Union membership .
While I advocate legislative stability , it is because we are living through exceptional times that I support the currently proposed amendment of Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to such an extent as to enable the creation of a permanent mechanism to safeguard the stability of the euro area , as proposed in report , adopted by this Chamber on 20 October 2010 .
On this issue there is a similarity between us .
It will be called upon to continue the work to take us towards our goal of seeing the Lisbon Treaty enter into force .
Let us avoid the usual proclamations and fine resolutions , the declarations of intent .
Based on the facts , yet not forgetting the political criterion I mentioned , I feel that the perfect , ideal centre would appear to be the Polish city of Wrocław , whose history has been created over the centuries , in part by the Czechs , Austrians , Jews and Germans , as well as the Poles .
Therefore , we need to introduce improvements in the food hygiene regulation so that inspectors have more legal certainty and more legal powers .
The railway sector is strategic for socioeconomic development .
I think it would be good to have a greater political presence of the Greens in the institutions of the Canary Islands , but with initiatives like this , full of demagogy and false accusations , believe me , I would like to say to the Member tabling the amendments , you are going in the wrong direction and you will have less and less political and social support in the Canary Islands .
Some questions were about goods - only deals .
In India , whole families live off the money that the children earn .
However , I believe what is missing from this report is the massive opportunity to cooperate with developing and emerging countries .
An inclusive dialogue is required , leading to a political settlement .
I think we have found a compromise that is acceptable to all parties in the matter of delegated acts .
Member States will only recover economically if the EU manages to remain competitive , and that is dependent on there being investment in research and education .
- Before the vote
I think that is a major area that we need to work on .
The actions undertaken by a coalition of European , Arab and North American countries implementing the UN resolution have helped protect the civilian population of Libya .
We have the guarantee of annual impact assessments .
