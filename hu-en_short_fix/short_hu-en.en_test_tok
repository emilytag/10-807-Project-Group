Regarding agriculture , it is worth noting the extreme volatility of the dairy sector , highlighting the need for a permanent approach to address this issue , namely , through a fund for the dairy sector .
This is not a record that anyone will have access to : the data are collected only in case of need .
The proposed European donor card is inappropriate , as rules on consent , allocation and organisational structure differ from one Member State to the next .

A sum of EUR 2.5 million has already been paid out without enough information .
I believe we all see it as our shared responsibility to ensure that European citizenship is seen not as a mere symbol but as a specific right to which substance can and must be given in day - to - day life .

The internal market is everywhere - it must be everywhere - but , Mr Harbour , the 2020 text is not designed to talk about everything .

Furthermore , the Community budget for the transport infrastructure is almost non - existent for the 2010-2013 period , even though the challenges and development needs are enormous : ensuring intermodality between different forms of transport , the development of high - speed railway lines to serve not only all the Member States ' capitals but other large European cities as well , the development of rail freight corridors and the single European sky , along with the modernisation of ports and the development of maritime transport .
Our goal is to help to produce the first principles and new joint international rules for an overhaul of the international financial system .

A general seized power in violation of constitutional legality and placed the President , the Prime Minister , other members of the Government and many civilians under arrest .
That is the course we are currently setting .
This office risks being a dangerous first step towards European competence for aspects of criminal law and the focus on its creation is a distraction from making existing systems and bodies work effectively .
It is surely a win - win situation - both dealing with our massive stockpiles of waste and providing an alternative energy supply source , particularly as we face an energy crisis and increasing dependence upon insecure foreign supplies of oil .
There was , incidentally , a speech made by the Polish Minister , who expressed his concern and his feeling that there was a need to react and to take a position regarding the systematic harassment of members of the Polish minority .
The World Bank , Oxfam , UNDP and others have come up with estimates ranging between USD 10 billion and , I would say , USD 100 billion yearly .
Could I ask if that aspect of independent living is being addressed by the study and , if not , would you undertake that a study of the availability of personal assistance and the generalisation of such a scheme across the European Union could be addressed , and indeed the portability of it ?
In principle it is ready to do so but it takes a certain amount of time .

This means in particular the right to paid maternity leave and to an earnings - based pension .
Representatives of the minorities are entitled to seats in parliament , even if they have not obtained the necessary votes .
( The President cut off the speaker )
So , with this debate and with the vote , Commission , Parliament and Council are filling a legal vacuum and enabling Member States , from tomorrow , to better prosecute those who pollute our seas : another step taken by the European institutions to strengthen the rights and freedoms of the European people .
I should like to say that , as rapporteur , I fully support Mrs De Lange 's amendment which proposes limiting the transport of live animals to abattoirs for slaughter to nine hours .

Unfortunately , the joint motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , for which I voted , and which expressed these concerns , could not be adopted , as it was just short of the number of votes required .
Instead , we should continue addressing the violations of human rights and civil liberties as vigorously as ever .
That is why , Mr President , we have considered the citizens ' initiative to be a priority .
I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on protection structures for narrow - track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors .

We have attained our goal in that Member States must provide considerable information on pesticides and in a form that is mutually comparable .
We need to increase collection .
I believe that the report on the health check of the Common Agricultural Policy is of special importance today , when the European Parliament has to show to the citizens its commitment and responsible political attitude to the development of the agricultural sector in the Community .
The interaction with the Commission during the preparation of this report and the consensus reached on this report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs have convinced me that Europe is prepared to take on this challenge .
These are very positive proposals and I welcome them .
in writing . - ( SV ) The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection are , unfortunately , of poor quality from a purely legislative perspective , and Chapters II , IV and V are superfluous .
The Council has also decided on the establishment of the European Alliance for Families .
Quite suddenly , the Liberal Group in the European Parliament also held a seminar on this issue .
Based on the assumption that the reasons for the rise in oil prices are of a structural nature and that such trend are likely to continue into the future , the Union needs to find long term solutions .

If , on the one hand , this choice of human resources policy offers greater flexibility , on the other , it will require increased training for European Union staff .
Ladies and gentlemen , the time is not yet ripe to call for a boycott ; the Olympic Games are still five months away .

So the next Commission will have nine female Members , one more than the current Commission , and once again I want to thank all of you who have supported me in this difficult task of getting at least a reasonable - not an ideal , but a reasonable - number of women for the next Commission .
Bridging loans under this facility can , however , prevent bankruptcy and job losses , and that is also in our interest .
Both parties would benefit from more in - depth relations , especially as there are numerous opportunities for cooperation in the fields of education , scientific research and renewable energies .
Mr President , as a born anti - revolutionary I shall be speaking with rather less passion than Mr Cohn - Bendit , but I understand now why 1968 was a success for him ; I could only follow events on television as a child .
One of the key solutions is better involving civil society that has a long tradition of organising social support .
( DE ) Mr President , I just wanted to ask Mrs McCarthy whether the weapon she has with her is marked and registered and whether she has permission to bring it into the House .

We have an additional layer of protection by only allowing bone in meat to come from Australia , Canada , Chile , New Zealand and the United States .
The terms ' illegal production ' and ' consumer care ' have a very nice ring to them , but I would like to know why we do not show the same determination in protecting consumers against the consumption of imported eggs produced in conditions which do not meet the requirements introduced in the EU .
This is a tidal wave that we have to stop , and better passports alone will not solve this matter .
The time has now come to make this fund as flexible as possible and to mobilise it without delay .
I fully agree that the Commission and the Member States should adopt measures to combat abuses , particularly regarding activities of companies not really engaged in any genuine and effective business in the country where they are registered .
This agreement is a major step towards better air quality in Europe .
I very much respect the opinions of people who are consistent in all of this : people who say , ' I do not think that is a particularly good idea ' , and follow it through by saying it here in Parliament and when they go before the committee and stick with that position .
The Members having had a look at this problem carefully will certainly be interested in this .
When I was there I also met Mrs Tadjibaeva , a political prisoner , who has now been released ; we hope that her health will improve and she can be given the proper care , but I was also able to see that a good benchmarking policy meant that progress could be achieved and that there was commitment from the authorities to meeting more fully the criteria defined by the European Union .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for completing a very demanding piece of work .
The citizens should also be actively involved in the coming elections to the European Parliament .

Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Méndez de Vigo for an excellent report .
The Commission has blocked the fisheries agreement with Guinea because government actions there resulted in the death of 150 demonstrators .

He told us that Britain 's so - called ' red lines ' have been secured .
Who has delivered this ?
Regarding the urgency procedure , here we already had some clear examples in the past that there are issues as regards food safety or safety of toys , for instance , that sometimes call for a very urgent procedure and , therefore , we think that we have to find something even more urgent than the early approval proposition made by the rapporteur .
Would you like me to tell you that if I am in favour of EPAs , of economic partnership agreements to create regional markets , then it is because I believe that to tackle the question of food security , economic partnership agreements are probably part of the solution , because until we have regional markets that are economically integrated , developing countries will not be able to benefit from globalisation ?
Things were simpler before .
The report has been elaborated mainly on the basis of the following two documents : the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament , the Council and the Court of Auditors entitled ' Cohesion Policy : Strategic Report 2010 on the implementation of the programmes 2007-2013 ' , and the Commission Staff Working Document accompanying the Communication .

It is unfortunate that the Czech presidency began not as previously planned , but with the imposed resolution of the Russian - Ukrainian gas conflict , in the same way that the previous presidency had to begin by seeking an end to the Russian - Georgian War .
However , we need to wait for the indices , to be prepared by the Commission , in order to finish planning the cross - border programme between Hungary , Romania , Slovakia and Ukraine , funded by ENPA .
Diplomacy without financial resources is merely a useless gesture .
I support the call to the Commission to increase , within the framework of the forthcoming Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion , the funding needed to deal with regional problems .

The Parliament has kept to its earlier commitments regarding emission reductions by 2020 , and has now set out even more ambitious targets for 2050 in the light of new recommendations from the scientific community .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , in the light of this text , allow me to express my satisfaction and to emphasise one requirement and one point on which we will need to be vigilant .
We have fulfilled our duty today .
It is vital that procedures such as this are introduced to help reduce the number of people at risk of poverty in the EU , in order to ensure that the EU 2020 goal of removing the risk for 20 million European citizens is met .
In my opinion , it is both balanced and ambitious .
Despite this , I would simply like to confirm something that you will like .
a vision that , of course , takes more specifically into consideration the problems of poverty that we are still facing in our Europe .
In adopting this resolution , the European Parliament , the voice of European citizens and democracy , is sending a clear message to the Chinese authorities : that eradicating and subjugating one culture to benefit another is an act that is not worthy of any truly great and modern country .
However , since I know that Commissioner Frattini has an interest in this matter , I will put the question to him : would it not be advisable to come up with a way of ensuring that these large international criminals who ruin the lives of thousands of families could also have their assets attached ?
Let us now go further .
So there is much that can and should be done to promote biogas and , at the same time , make agriculture more sustainable .

As an MEP who has always paid particular attention to issues relating to crime prevention , security and police cooperation , I acknowledge the fundamental importance of Europol in creating a secure European area and preventing crime throughout Europe , along with the need for it to be reinforced at various levels , including those under discussion here .
Saving energy and making rational use of it are further very important actions .
I think one of the problems we have here in the European Union - and I think we do it out of the very best of intentions - is that if we need to do something , we immediately legislate .
It is a measure that will ensure greater transparency during the adoption of legislative acts , regulating methods of control by Member States over the exercise of powers conferred on the Commission .
It strengthens commercial measures against the illegal use of and illegal trade in substances that deplete the ozone layer in the European Union and will help to prevent environmental dumping in developing countries .
The Euro Plus Pact does , without a doubt , represent a step forward but much remains to be done .

Before the vote on Amendment 35 :
The role of the EU is vitally important , as it has mechanisms and instruments at its disposal , such as the Solidarity Fund , the Structural Funds - the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund - and the Cohesion Fund , which need to be activated and applied in a quick , flexible and simplified manner .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.10 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
It remains to be seen whether a move to coordinate the good 200 BITs in operation in the European Union can finally resolve the problem whereby binding BIT arbitration judgments based on international law entail commitments to investors by Member States that give rise to EU Treaty infringement proceedings .
The European Parliament must send out a clear message that it places the defence of these values above short - term economic interests .
The complexity of European Union financial regulations , moreover , often involves an enormous expenditure of time and money on red tape alone .
There are many areas of that country where even the authorities cannot exercise legitimate democratic power .
It would make the legal position clearer , allow the planning of necessary investments , and bring an end to the coexistence of two payment systems - national and European - which leads to needless expenditure .
Today , our Parliament is paying special attention to the current situation by adopting a resolution only on Ashraf .
Our reservations are based finally on the fact that , at a time when we wish to take Europe down the road of a green economy , the text proposed to us deals neither with the energy performance of products nor with their partial harmfulness to users .
That report will provide an in - depth analysis of the situation of young people in Europe and thereby help us to highlight their concerns .
It refers to the Treaty of Lisbon , which we have strenuously opposed , and also voices support for a permanent EU operational headquarters , backing for an EU ' White Book ' on European defence , and unequivocal praise of the European Defence Agency .

However , it is unclear whether we can counter the phenomenon of terrorism effectively in this way .
Finally , I would like to stress that it should be a priority for the Commission to present all legislative proposals needed to adapt the acquis to the provisions of Articles 290 and 291 , including the acquis in policy areas which , pursuant to the Lisbon Treaty , are now subject to the codecision procedure .
In addition , I call upon the Commission to give serious consideration to establishing a single information and reservation interface for all interconnected modes of transport .

My services are doing their best to ensure that regulations or agreements on international trade take fully into account the contribution , but also the necessary constraints , of customs concepts and procedures .
European military engagement contributed to the prevention of a situation similar to the one in Rwanda .
This is perhaps a long and slow process of contributing to the gradual realisation that , in Russia too , things can be different , more normal , and people happier , since the country has that potential .
We are proceeding with that , but it needs a lot of work because the directive , as originally adopted , was not functional .
The audit opinion would be clean .
In order to prevent such bad habits , I have tabled an alternative resolution , which 40 Members have signed to indicate their support .
However , this is tantamount to an accusation of deception , fraud , and unjust enrichment on my part .
Now while I am not sure whether the term ' justification ' is adequate here - and personally I think that in French it would have been preferable to use the term ' praise ' or ' apologia ' for terrorism - and whether it would not have been better to change it , I will be interested to see how this House reacts tomorrow to this somewhat delicate point , which goes to the very heart of the debate , namely where to draw the line between security , fundamental rights and freedom of expression .
I voted in favour of this report , which was approved in this House on the day when we celebrate the centenary of the day dedicated to women .

( NL ) Mr President , allow me to start with some words of criticism .
Bulgaria suffered the most in terms of losses resulting from the recent gas war between Russia and Ukraine .

The report notes significant differences among them in terms of resources , technical expertise and stakeholder engagement in the standardisation process .
But under these proposals , all services are open , except those specifically excluded at the outset .
We are at an historic juncture when transatlantic cooperation has become vital with a view to jointly drawing up a new security strategy for the European Union and the new strategic concept for NATO .

I can tell you , Mme Iotova , that the Bulgarian market has 180 inspectors .
Today the waste has reached the Quirinale , where the dirty Bolshevik Napolitano has given the order to provide blandishments to prolong the death - agony of his drinking friends , without a care for democracy or for the people 's wish to vote for a new parliament .
It jeopardises people 's relationships , work and health and , in no time at all , they can accumulate thousands of euros in debt .
The political forces that created this political crisis by rejecting this austerity programme , tabled by the government and supported by the European Commission , the Council and the European Central Bank , can be very satisfied with this .
- Madam President , the European Parliament 's priority today has to be to get the largest majority possible for the Commission proposal to extend and make permanent the option to lower VAT rates on labour - intensive services .
Particular focus should be directed towards the formulation of regulation which ensures greater spectrum efficiency , better frequency planning and safeguards against anti - competitive behaviour and the taking of anti - social measures with regards to the usage of the spectrum .
That , to my mind , is the core of both the Rasmussen and the Lehne reports : the need to establish European financial regulation .
Thirdly - and probably most importantly - we now need , in particular , to tackle the crisis in confidence that we are seeing throughout the world and particularly here in Europe .
I myself have tried , with the Safer Internet Programme , to do something else in this respect .
In the Europe 2020 strategy , the Commission promised to concentrate on growth based on knowledge and innovation .
However , as things now stand , the chances must be against producing a directive at all during this parliamentary term .
Taiwan could have been better pre - warned if the WMO provided it with timely information .
The aim of all that is to foster the sustainable , peaceful development of the peoples of the world .
Violence is never acceptable and will not contribute to finding a lasting solution .
Plans for the later years of the programme are less detailed at this stage .

Lastly , the Commission is using the programme to finance many projects in sub - Saharan Africa addressing the prevention of illegal immigration , the promotion of legal migration , the link between migration and development and the promotion of refugee and asylum - seeker advocacy .
This powerful instrument that the treaty has placed at our disposal coincides with the worst economic situation that Europe has seen since 1929 .
Good progress has been made , and the texts have come along very well where the vast majority of points are concerned .

What we must do is defend and improve the rights and working conditions of road transport workers , by combating job insecurity , respecting rest periods - without any loss of pay - and ensuring compliance with the labour legislation or collective agreements existing in each Member State .
EULEX was also to take charge in three areas : customs , police and jurisdiction and crucially , there was to be no - and I mean no - ambiguous relationship between EULEX on the one hand and UNMIK , the UN organisation , on the other .
For three consecutive days in April , the international industry lost USD 400 million a day , threatening to blow efforts to restructure the financially weaker airlines in Europe sky high .
It should be borne in mind , however , that they will result in higher production costs , thus causing European producers to become less competitive .
I firmly believe that , if Parliament adopts this amendment , the Council will incorporate this rule into the compromise .
This new dimension of European foreign policy is something that we should and , indeed , must follow up to make the world a freer , fairer and more social place in future .

( FR ) Mr President , Amnesty International has set the tone of our debate in a statement issued today .
We recall that 54.4 % of voters stayed at home in the 2004 European Parliament elections .

My friends , today we can think of a larger neighbourhood , one that stretches from north of the Baltic Sea to south of the Mediterranean , one that is shared by Europe and the Middle East .
When I hear other Members of this House saying that people simply need to take out an additional private pension for their old age , I want to reply that many people can barely survive on what they earn , never mind paying for an additional private pension .
I will close with the words of my late countryman Mr Justice Asprey : ' Reform ?

If we really do want , as an exceptional measure - such as the one , I apologise to Mrs Serracchiani , used in this case , namely that of discussing one country and not Europe - to ascertain the truth about the health of democracy within our country , then we should ask the President of the Republic , Giorgio Napolitano , respectfully as an institution , whether he feels that he is the President of a country in which pluralism of information is floundering , freedom is in a tailspin and the tide of democracy is going out .

Indeed , in order to ensure that this derogation , which should allow for the creation of jobs and wealth , is of genuine benefit to local populations and does not harm the European fishery product processing and canning industries , it was vital to provide for an assessment of its impact as soon as possible and to allow for its suspension , where necessary .
So , I believe that the best way is for the budget to finance any agency , but if there is the possibility of supplementary funds being raised , it should be evaluated .

It is because of all that that I believe that we simply have to be aware that we still need many years of major oil consumption but that we must nevertheless be fully ambitious as we walk the path away from oil : 20 % renewable energy sources in 10 years ' time .

It is a problem not just of the future but of the present .
Certain Member States have already introduced alert mechanisms that enable all public authorities and civil society to be mobilised in a very short space of time in order to search for and find the victim .
I feel it important to emphasise how much our contribution was fundamental in ensuring that the two partnerships to be launched after the pilot initiative on healthy ageing will both address ' smart cities ' , so that a number of futuristic experiments can be held in various European cities in order to reach the 20/20/20 objectives and for the purpose of realising the non - energy raw materials strategy , since we need to provide a concrete response to the great and difficult problems that affect society in this field .
We have significantly strengthened the obligations to provide information to our citizens , the consumers .

( EL ) Mr President , the G 20 summit in November did not , in my opinion , have substantial results .
The Council has still not pronounced the slightest condemnation of the world 's current largest human rights crisis , Darfur .
Given the generally positive content of the resolution , I will vote for it , but not without registering my profound disagreement with this interpretation of what the education system should be .

The Commission may , however , assess the constitution - as it may any other legal act of a Member State - from the perspective of its compliance with Union law .

The Commission 's communication is welcome , despite the delayed action , and the Commission now intends to act quickly , with certain aspects to be included in a new technical measure regulation in 2008 .

Annex I of this report is the best proof of this , as it lists all the situations in which there have been human rights violations that we in Europe have denounced or have not shirked from condemning ; from Afghanistan to Somalia , from Russia to Iran .
Support is also just as important for private youth initiatives , which can lead to job creation and , by extension , social integration .
Today energy is almost synonymous with foreign policy and tends to relegate even climate change to a secondary position .
Here we should also bear in mind the competences of the Member States .
I just want to ask the question as to why you decided to ask five questions from one Commissioner and only one question from another .
Let us learn from the lesson of what happened in the referenda in France , the Netherlands and Ireland .
All in all , I would like to thank the Court of Auditors very much for this report .
Carbon trading aims to commercialise the Earth 's capacity to recycle carbon and , thus , to regulate the climate .

We know very well what .

I would like to emphasise , as we have done many times before , that , in order to make these negotiations successful from our side , we have to speak with one voice .
Equality between women and men is a fundamental right and common value of the European Union .
I am a liberal Member from Catalonia , and my region - which is the source of 28 % of Spain 's exports - also has a very high ratio of exports to gross domestic product : almost 30 % .

Or perhaps in the end , when you look at this whole process , you wonder whether there is the leadership on both sides to complete this or whether it was just an idea of the 20th century , which , in the 21st century , makes no sense at all .

It is therefore important to know that the Commission can show what progress has been achieved by the Member States in preparing for the ban on the rearing of laying hens in conventional batteries from 1 January 2012 , what measures it will take against Member States whose producers do not comply , and what measures it will take to prevent potential unfair competition from third countries in the EU egg market from 1 January 2012 .

Two , the fact that power is shifting , both within political systems - roughly from governments to markets , media and NGOs - and between political systems - roughly from the old ' West ' to both the east and the south .

They make a huge contribution to the promotion of cultural dialogue , and the task , here too , is to establish new global balances in this sector between the United States and between other continents , which are major producers , and Europe , which has its rightful place .
There is still a lot to do in the country as regards respect for democracy , human rights and the rule of law .

They are , indeed , issuing permits to both Arabs and Israelis in both parts of the town , but what the Commission is saying now , and also said last week , is : you have to discriminate against Israelis in East Jerusalem because the city is one whole entity , anyway , and that cannot be changed , the town is governed by a single local authority .
This is by no means a new idea , yet to date we have not done enough in this regard .

As regards the second question about the 70 % rate for cofinancing , the initial percentage rate was 60 % and I felt that , in the current economic climate , it was necessary to increase it .
It will give some benefits to consumers and small businesses .
Reports of planned cuts of up to 30 % by the Irish Government to some services amply illustrates their lack of real commitment to prevention , protection and prosecution .
That is one of the risk elements .

These environmental accounts can help us in this regard .
However , most of them believe that Europe is hindering their ability to produce more food by forcing a reduction in stocking rates through nitrate and phosphate regulations , red tape , a lack of research and development within the industry , and hence an attitude that food security is not an issue .

The new procedures will begin to apply to all existing legislation from day one .
It is part of an overall compromise and , taking all the circumstances into account , I do not think it would have been proper for the Commission to allow the question of transitional deadlines for a few products to cause the compromise to fail .
The tax will also respond to the Millennium Development Goals and contribute to large European projects in infrastructure , research , ecological restructuring and in our system of production .
The health and safety of MEPs , employees and visitors to Parliament should be an absolute priority .
One speaker mentioned that it is crucial that we ourselves should be able to distinguish between important and non - important matters ; the role of the legislature is really to concentrate on vital matters and for this reason it needs to delegate certain powers to the executive , in other words to the Commission , but we must retain the possibility and the right to scrutinise implementing measures drawn up by it .
To conclude , it is our duty for future generations to continue to lead by example and reach a legally binding agreement by the end of this year , ensuring a better and sustainable future for all .

Extending the agreement for scientific and technological cooperation with the United States is a confirmation of the need for cooperation and mutually beneficial exchanges between the EU and US in the cutting - edge sectors of research and innovation .
Anyone who has heard your speech knows that President Arias and Costa Rica stand for freedom and democracy .
However , that area still experiences unequal treatment between nationals of a Member State and those from third countries .
We can agree today , however , by way of exception .
I also agree that the social economy should however engage with continually evolving market developments , in order to come up with effective strategies to meet its objectives .
Uganda is a country in which the majority of people survive on a dollar a day : surely the country 's legislators can find better ways to serve the interests of Ugandan society than to make gays subject to criminal prosecution .

( FR ) Mr President , multilingual teaching , polyglot teachers addressing each child in his or her mother tongue , foreign teachers recruited especially for them , respect for and even promotion of cultures of origin by schools , minimum knowledge of the language of the host country , without this even being considered as really obligatory : this type of recipe does not lead to the integration of migrants . It would lead meanwhile , and paradoxically , to the ghettoisation of our societies , to the blurring of identities , and to the acculturation of all , whether migrants or the original inhabitants of the host country .
In the spirit which should preside over this similar agreement , all measures which remove obstacles to contact between European citizens and those of this other Portuguese - speaking country are obviously to be welcomed .
Whilst it is very important to manage financial crises , more needs to be done for the SMEs right now , because they are the real economy .

What action are we going to take ?
President Van Rompuy , you spoke about budgetary discipline .

Both the UN and the Commission undertook to apply specific guidelines and to monitor their application closely .

The global financial crisis has exposed the inconsistent behaviour of European Union governments and the European Central Bank , which are able to find funds to save banks from collapse , thereby breaching the provisions of the Stability Pact , when for many years they would not permit the slightest departure from the Pact 's rules in order to meet important social needs .

In this report , we do not only set out the policies we want to achieve .
As far as I am concerned , the most important thing is that this directive will contribute to ensuring that it is primarily treatment methods that cross the border .
We have our system of fiscal rules , the Stability and Growth Pact , which must be properly implemented .
We had the Year of Folk Culture , the Month of the Book , the Month of the Czechoslovak - Soviet Friendship , the Cosmos Week , the Miners ' Day .
For dialogue to be effective , to be transformative in bringing about core change in persons , it cannot be done on the basis of ' subject ' and ' object ' .
the report by Hans - Peter Martin on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2006 ( C 6-0387/2007 - ,
The European Parliament amended the Commission 's proposal pointing out the importance of respect for human rights , development policies , energy diversification , request for strategic documents , greater transparency of the EIB policies and activities .
One of the most important achievements is the fact that we have succeeded in imposing on the Council , even against its will , the fact that we have taken as our basic definition of pesticides the one that Parliament , in the political agreement with the Council , previously included in the directive on sustainable use .
Pursuing this path is suicidal and will lead to the fragmentation of Europe .
Mr President , thank you very much for offering me this opportunity to offer my explanation of vote on the suspension of the Doha Round .
'4 .
A separate issue is the question of allowing genetically - modified agricultural production in the European market .
Certainly , the implementation of European rules and penalty systems in relation to animal welfare must be improved to ensure that there is a satisfactory minimum standard of animal welfare in the European Union .
It is important to me that the results of this SME test be subject to an independent evaluation by an independent body , and this idea has been incorporated into the text .
So , rather than using biofuels as a scapegoat , we must move to end agricultural protectionism and export restrictions ; we must move to enhance agricultural development in the poorest countries and to ensure the success of the Doha Development Round to encourage free , fair and sustainable farm trade at global level .
Not all the companies active in this area are multinationals ; there are many small companies too .
The EU could really do a lot about this : exchange of information , support and solidarity .
This is precisely the principle on which the parliamentary elections must take place .
Secondly , I think that young people in particular are disadvantaged , and youth in my country , in Ireland , are the most disadvantaged group ever because now they are landed with the big debt resulting from the banking crisis and , despite being highly educated , they have one choice only , to choose their ticket abroad if they want to work ; there are no jobs for them at home .
Let me finish on the reality of the situation .
The Presidency believes that the reason why it would be necessary for us to focus on other provisions of the directive , that is , chapters one and three , is that this is where we can create true European added value .
Baroness Ashton said that some progress has been made , and of course it has , but there are severe problems still .
Fortunately , the paragraph explicitly mentioning the need to replace the pay - as - you - go system with capital - funded systems was rejected by a large majority in this House .
That is not actually an impossible task .
If it becomes selection , then it is no longer a positive policy .
It is extremely important that we understand that , for example , the mobile phones we hold in our hands in our daily lives , actually contain precious materials , from gold to platinum to rhodium , which are extremely important for the future .
The work they have done in this area has brought peace to many families .
Politics and the army are being infiltrated by neo - Nazis and racists .
That is why I do not have the details you are asking about .
In addition , an independent National Commission of Human Rights is being set up .
The geographic environment of the countries situated in the more northerly parts of Europe is vastly different from that of the southern ones .
An EU civil protection mechanism , a team of six experts , is also now in Chile .
The framework directive will appear somewhere between autumn 2010 and spring 2011 .
Now it could become underrated .
Why submit a resolution that has already been submitted on many other occasions just when we are fortunately starting to get somewhere with the Chinese Government ?
In a globalised economy , the efficient and innovative use of energy , materials and resources is a key issue .
The Union cannot continue to faithfully repeat past promises , such as that made to the western Balkan states at the Thessaloniki European Council of 2003 that they would join the European Union .
As you know , we must rebuild public finances on sustainable foundations .
Would it not be better to improve the services provided in Biarritz by introducing non - polluting forms of transport ?
From the current level of about 380 parts per million in the atmosphere , further CO 2 increases will have a trivial effect .
I hope that , by adopting amendments , we can still make some improvements to this draft and actually do what is necessary , namely to formulate the sort of ambitious waste - management policy we need in the European Union .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , yesterday evening , the Lega Nord delegation was the only political party which voted , in committee , against this resolution .

A European strategy to integrate the Roma more effectively is a very important issue .
I am sorry , it is not possible .
I would like to know whether you think that it is not leading the European Union to have negotiations going on at this moment with this House on the financial supervision package .

It is high time that we thought about this problem and , in the future , adopted a different format .
I remain painfully aware of the situation of Dhondup Wangchen , the Tibetan film maker , who suffers from hepatitis B and is in need of urgent medical attention in prison .
I would like to thank this Parliament very sincerely for the extremely hard work and commitment it has shown in maintaining a high level of ambition on this issue .
To date , the Kosovo issue has not been resolved because the international community has been unable to come to an agreement .

Mr President , you said last weekend that you were not ready to put your European flag back in your pocket , and indeed we have seen that you have raised it under the Arc de Triomphe next to the French flag .
What are the energy sources ?
It is a vibrant country that has many intellectual , cultural and other depths , and we should like to see it commit itself to working with us in several areas , including energy , human rights , the Middle East and nuclear energy .
As you all know , our cooperation with Tajikistan is currently still governed by the trade and cooperation agreement concluded with the USSR in 1989 and endorsed by Tajikistan in 1994 .

Stocks of tuna in the Mediterranean Sea are also gravely threatened .
Unless we improve the morale of our fellow citizens , we will not restore consumer confidence , without which economic recovery will not be possible The information provided to our fellow citizens has to be balanced and honest and not encourage defeatism by hiding the progress , the successes and practical consequences of the recovery plans , whilst taking into account the timescales necessary for them to produce their effects .
Is it really reasonable for the EU to use European taxpayers ' money in advertising campaigns to convince the same citizens that they should buy the goods that they have already subsidised ?
The validity of the trade preferences should not be terminated because this could have negative consequences on the overall economic performances of the Western Balkans , with consequent negative repercussions on their domestic reform and transition processes .
There is a differentiation according to the Member States and greater account will be taken of inputs .
The report also notes a number of issues affecting the process of Croatia 's integration into the European Union .
More than a billion people are currently suffering from starvation .
This represents a considerable improvement over the narrower wording originally proposed by the rapporteur .
We must set out strict conditions to accompany the peace and development process in the Middle East .
What we have achieved to date has therefore been primarily directed at settling these conflicts of interest , for we in the committee are of the opinion that such a regulation is needed and that every effort should be made to agree on one .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . - ( EL ) Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , I should like to convey our opinion to you .
In this respect , it would be desirable for national legislation transposing the Directive to make provision for special training programmes for drivers of articulated buses .
It is a communication about our legislative activities in the near future - a communication concerning mutual relations between the European Commission and the European Parliament in the legislative process .
In spite of this huge effort , Afghanistan is still the number one producer of narcotic drugs .
We probably all agree that it is essential to run an information campaign promoting the SOLVIT network as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism .
I also welcome the support for and recognition of initiatives such as CIty - VITAlity - Sustainability ( CIVITAS ) and Intelligent Energy Europe , which form the basis for this kind of programme .
I also support the Ombudsman in his following primary objectives : to ensure that the European Union 's citizens will enjoy the benefits and resources of the Treaty of Lisbon and to achieve better cooperation with national and regional ombudsmen , thereby ensuring greater transparency of activity at European level .
( NL ) First of all , I regret the fact that right now we are unable to paint a rosy picture of the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
Each Member State has constantly persisted in improving equal access to those who need it the most .
What is more , this somewhat contradicts your statement this morning in relation to sugar .
Dates for next sittings : see Minutes
That is the logical consequence of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon .
I read with great interest and a strong sense of involvement the report tabled by Mr Brok and approved on Monday in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .

I support all the efforts that have been made in this regard , which are restoring public confidence in the markets .

The Russian authorities are constructing stands , intended to be used for only 14 days during the Olympics , on the location of the oldest part of the village .
The correct solution is : yes to stress tests , yes to supervision and no to demonising nuclear energy .
This is important for all partners , especially for business people .
I must , first of all , stress that this budgetary procedure is taking place at a time when we are emerging from an economic crisis , and , even if the European budget can and must help in emerging from this crisis , we must not lose sight of the considerable budgetary restraints that affect our national budgets .
These advances justify my vote in favour of the final text .
Where does the integration of social and social sustainability objectives with macro - economic policy stop ?
I have always argued that the regional level is the most appropriate for stimulating research and innovation because it favours universities , public research bodies , large companies , small and medium - sized enterprises , and regional and local public authorities working closely together , specifically as clusters .
It takes a long time and I would not venture to give time frames , but let us remember that enlargement is a good European Union policy , although it is a long - term one .

It is precisely in large companies that the worst kinds of animal abuse take place .
Just for clarification to Paolo De Castro , intervention for cheese was actually abolished in 1994 .
The debate is closed .
I had prepared a lot of other things to say , but I must point out that we have certainly not achieved all we can here .
I should also say that , in the EU 2020 strategy , ' taxation ' or ' taxes ' is mentioned many times , which is in strong contrast with previous strategic documents .
( SK ) Mr Milinkevich , Mr Kozulin , I am delighted that you are here for today 's debate on your country , Belarus .
Furthermore , Commissioner , you cannot be unaware that paternity leave already exists in the national legislation of many Member States .
( FR ) Mr President , the negotiations have highlighted the failure of the EU 's strategy , which was aimed at making others follow in its wake by being the most virtuous .
The people of Southern Sudan who lived and worked in the North , sometimes even owning property , have fled to the South in tens , even hundreds , of thousands .
We know all the excuses .
A solely military response cannot be enough , it is true .
Draft general budget 2010 ( Section III ) (
All these issues must be tackled rigorously , systematically and positively , without raising doubts about the way that competition policy works .
This means that we are not in the business of giving a free ride to those who do not respect certain key principles .
( SL ) Actually , it is strange that issues concerning the system 's operability should crop up time and again whenever we tackle these kinds of major and weighty technical questions .

in writing . - Given the tough austerity measures currently being taken across all Member States , I believe that it is inappropriate to provide funding for a European House of History at this time , which is why I voted against this report .
What we need , therefore , is for all the European political groups that are in power to work together .
Mr President , I would like to remind you that my group has decided not to take part in the vote for the reasons I mentioned earlier .
A common European strategy is obviously needed , but the European Union will not get anywhere if it is acting alone .
Objectives in those fields cannot be enforced at European level ; and rightly so .
The diversification must allow an indigenous development that would create stability and well - being in these regions .
It is a sad sight to see the Member States lining up separately in order to be able to offer their citizens the prospect of a trip to the United States without a visa , in exchange for security measures that the Americans could not negotiate with the Union as such .
( BG ) Madam President , I congratulate Mrs Oomen - Ruijten for the fine job she has done .
I believe this is what the taxpayers of Europe would expect of us .
In this directive , however , liability is limited to the first subcontractor level , which is something that we do not consider acceptable .
in writing . - ( SV ) Africa is a continent in need of aid , stronger trade links and increased participation in the globalisation which is creating greater welfare for all .
However , the greatest disagreements concern the figures , of course .
And it is very cynical to portray the European financing of European election campaigns and all manner of European political foundations as a strengthening of European democracy .
In recent years , with the approaching Olympic Games in Beijing , we have learned of other ' developments ' such as the fact that people 's accommodation is being demolished without compensation being awarded , in order to make way for the construction of Olympic structures , and the existence of a list of 42 categories of people not to be allowed to attend the Olympic games , including the Dalai Lama , his followers and human rights defenders .
Are there any comments ?
Yes , we also need to maximise the skills in our own Member States , and that is why we support the amendment recalling , for example , the anti - discrimination legislation , which we also hope will be ambitious in its next stage .
But let us be also clear .
Through the Internet , all journalists can express themselves freely and get in touch with the public .
As we know , the decisions of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) are partly to blame for the crisis that we are experiencing .
But we also know that Russia is a key partner in tackling regional conflicts and global challenges - also mentioned here - and that much remains to be done to develop the full potential of our relationship .
Mr President , in times of economic stringency , faced with cuts in public spending right across European countries , all the EU 's institutions should be looking at how to cut costs and waste .
I am addressing the Commission in order to ask it what it intends to do to end this injustice .
Now , two years later , people are only grateful .
We would save a lot of time .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
I voted for Mr Cashman 's report concerning the extent to which the Millennium Development Goals set out in the year 2000 have been realised .
As such , while they do not replace the decision of whether or not to adopt a given solution , they can be decisive in shaping the choice of a given political solution .
Waste management must be based on prevention , reuse , recycling , recovery and , lastly , disposal , and this hierarchy must be a guiding principle .

I am in favour of the recommendation on the comprehensive revision of the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries , inasmuch as it incorporates modern concepts on fisheries management .
One of the main arguments for reducing VAT is that it will provide more favourable distribution of income after consumption , by reducing the cost of the shopping basket of low - income households and increasing that of high - income households .
Universal access to high - speed access is largely dependent on this sharing of frequencies .
Mr President , Commissioner , the questions raised by the committee chair in this debate reflect global circumstances .
There is no response from the Commission here .
I am grateful to Mr Juncker for pointing out that indirect taxation should not be increased but reduced whenever possible .
in writing . - I voted against the Podimata report on innovative financing because it wants to introduce a financial transfer tax which , while it is claimed that it is needed to protect the economy from risky trading and to provide a fund to use in the event of another crisis , and will only be placed on wholesale and professional industry , it will inevitably be passed on to the consumer and citizen taxpayer who is already struggling in this crisis .
It will hinder the big flow of normal investments and trade that we are in need of .
After all , we have seen the present regime attempting to silence the legitimate political protest of students and journalists through arbitrary arrests and detentions .
The debate is closed .
Turning to the questions you have asked concerning implementation : depending on the country , the choice will be made on the basis of criteria of effectiveness .
There will be lessons that we , too , must learn from this , however , namely that in emergencies the veneer of civilisation soon peels and that 24 hours can be too long .
This is very much in the hands of the Member States .
A sensible thing that the coalition government can do is to stop throwing good money after bad .
This can only be achieved if adequate time is available for the stakeholders to respond , so I think that a maximum of nine months is not an exaggerated period .
So we cannot be careful enough with toys , but I am glad that we have sent this message now .
Some questions remain unanswered , not all fears have been dispelled .
( FR ) Mr President , my colleague , Mrs De Keyser , has had the opportunity to recall the tragedy that occurred in Liège on 27 January .
We thus need to focus on human resources development and capacity building , with a special focus on young people , women , and minorities ; and on the development of more rational policies in small and remote villages , taking into account the existing local natural and human resources as well as people 's needs .
Firstly , we are facing a crisis that was predicted .
Producers have a right to expect Parliament to put forward the radical measures they need .
We cannot develop a proper European immigration policy if we do not put an end to the imbalance that exists in the current Treaties : the fight against illegal immigration has to be made part of a proper Community system and the present all - round paralysis affecting our policy on legal immigration can no longer be tolerated .
Contrary to what this report claims , Africa and the European Union do not currently share the same way of thinking about more democracy , good governance and human rights .
It is regrettable that this proposal , dating back to 2003 , and which aims to provide refugees with long - term resident status after five years of continuous legal residence , has not been implemented in the intervening period .
As Europeans , we need to guard against protectionist practices , which are increasingly rearing their heads , mainly due to the poor situation with the world economy , but also under the banner of protecting food safety .
For this reason , the Committee on International Trade also points out some matters that were left out .
in writing . - ( RO ) I support the Europe 2020 strategy promoting economic growth which is smart ( based on knowledge and innovation ) , environmentally friendly and conducive to social inclusion .
This kind of enduring intervention distorts the market ; an extremely dangerous game which , in a worst case scenario , could bring the entire global economy to its knees .

The distortion is even more serious if it is also based on the assumption that the state should help banks which are not able to pay their customers .
Your contributions improve the text ; for example , the new deadline set for designing a national approach , an explicit reference to the involvement of local and regional authorities .
The first question I wish to ask myself in this respect is what COP conferences are in the first place ?
I repeat , including during this period .
It also reminds us of the need to support the real economy more than ever ; in particular , through an ambitious European industrial policy .
The debate is closed .
in writing . - ( PT ) Kosovo has still not received unanimous recognition by the Member States .

I called , in fact I met , Issaias and spoke to him about this issue .
I am therefore going to try to answer the various questions that have been put to me and try hard to group together the speeches , since several of them related to the same subjects .
The peoples of Europe must intensify their struggle to finally reject the reactionary Euro - Constitution .
Given the present gas crisis in Europe , it must be underlined that Belarus has proved a particularly stable partner as regards the transit of gas supplies to the European Union .
A successful car industry is important to the Union .
( The sitting was opened at 9.00 a.m. )
Agreements on eliminating double taxation which are concluded bilaterally between Member States in accordance with the aforementioned autonomous powers and consistent with the OECD sample agreement do not appear to be sufficient for eliminating all legal double taxation in the EU .
I believe that over 1.8 million SMEs benefited from loan guarantees in 2009 .
So let me trace some of the chequered history .
The negative impact of advertisements for foodstuffs with a high fat , sugar or salt content is very serious .
Within this context , reducing the impact of transport on global warming will play a decisive role .

in writing . - ( ES ) I voted against this report : it is a very delicate topic as it affects more and more people , and the fact that it is being treated as a logistical rather than a human problem is intolerable .
With confidence in the financial markets at a low and the banking sector in disarray , is the Council working to tackle the crisis and restore confidence by implementing a coherent and combined approach , or is it felt that Member States are better prepared to manage the financial turmoil unilaterally ?

Bahrain is at risk of becoming the site of a confrontation between Iran and Saudi Arabia .

In other words , the final accounts for 2008 present a true and fair view , although due attention should be paid to addressing weaknesses in the systems of a number of directorates - general of the Commission .
Who decided that , Madam President ?
In addition , as already stated , the European Commission has adopted a six - year strategic development plan for Chile for 2007-2013 , which makes provision for the take - up of Community resources by this Latin American country for regional and sectoral programmes being undertaken by the country 's recently - elected government .
In my view , the application of the package will enable us primarily to ensure the following .

Mr President , the board in this meeting room shows that today 's topic is called innovative financing .

on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , Mrs Yade , Mr Vice - President of the Commission , today , we celebrated the 20th anniversary of the Sakharov Prize , and last week saw the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - and these two events have never been so relevant .
I voted against the Council 's annual report to Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) in 2008 , because I think that the objective of the CFSP should be to define the EU 's external policy , not defend its territory .
It also shows that the EU is on the right track in improving its relationships with this continent , which has a larger population than the EU - 27 .
Where is Europe ?
Political personalities like the French and Spanish European Commissioners will founder here .
( IT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Muscardini , and all the shadow rapporteurs with whom I have worked on this issue , which is extremely important for us .

I would like to express the hope that this time the European Commission will approach the task of preparing a common energy policy more seriously .
The European Council has decided that it can only appoint new commissioners when there is legal clarity on the Treaty , and we have not yet completed this process .
Therefore , it is particularly important that we do not base our framework programme on the lowest , weakest standards .
In this strong Europe , we will probably have to dispense with the expression ' improving coordination ' , as it means that everything is dependent on the subjects that have to be coordinated and inevitably leads to paralysis and a lack of clarity .
There is evidence that several of these flights were carrying prisoners from the Incirlik base in Turkey to Guantanamo , including the ' Bosnian Six ' .
Mr President , I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate today and want to address a very specific issue that has already been raised by some of the colleagues that I have listened to .
In this regard , I would like , once again , to call on the other two institutions , the Commission and the Council , to give this matter top priority in the next Financial Perspective .
This information is not easy to control on the Internet , but sooner or later we have to deal with that problem , which will not disappear if we simply do not do anything because it is too complicated .
The recent incident related to the declaration of independence by Kosovo showed a lack of unity among the Member States in terms of opinion and , on the same grounds , it is likely that the same diversity of opinion will be shown when the matter under discussion is the situation of our extra - community neighbours .
So we restored the present summer time regime , turning the clock twice a year .
We ought to take the following measures to end the crisis in this sector : extend the measures envisaged for storing butter , milk powder and cheeses , speed up the creation of a dairy product fund to meet the needs of small producers and young farmers , and reach an understanding with the supermarkets in terms of setting a fair price for both agricultural producers and retailers .
For most victims , crime has various psychological and moral repercussions that continue long after the crime has been committed .
This sharing of information empowers and strengthens national parliaments .
In fact , it needs to be able to react as quickly as possible , because the precise philosophy of the Solidarity Fund is to cover emergencies or part of the emergencies caused by disasters .
I am actively looking at whether we can provide additional funding in all of these areas .
If we are in agreement , and if we have a clear and constructive dialogue , it will be good for Russia , it will be good for the EU and it will be good for many pertinent issues in the European and the global arena .
I would remind those of you who have not had the opportunity to speak that , if you wish , you can submit a written statement not exceeding 200 words which will be annexed to the verbatim report of proceedings , should you wish to keep a record of what you wanted to say if you had been able to do so .
It should thus be said strongly , and said here , and said by this Parliament : fascist intolerance has nothing to do with the war on terrorism !
This has never happened in history .
It goes without saying that this report must not provide an opportunity for data abuse .
You will soon receive a number of proposals from Parliament on how the directive might be improved .
That , of course , is a matter for the Iranians .
Likewise , we could say that , fortunately , the rumours surrounding the UN climate process have been shown to be greatly exaggerated .
These are all concerns that have been relayed by many MEPs , who do not wish to place ' blind ' confidence in the negotiations conducted by the European Commission .
I firmly support this simplified regime since third country nationals holding a visa issued by another Member State who would benefit from this system , have already been subject to a strict screening process in that Member State and were not considered a threat to public order or a risk in terms of illegal immigration .

Let us tell it like it is .
It is very good that existing strengths are being built on by means of ' Active and Healthy Ageing ' - actually , healthy living rather than healthy ageing - and it would seem that , in fact , healthy ageing begins at conception .

Radioactive contamination is transboundary in nature .

This is how European integration proceeds : in fits and starts and in small steps .

Not one of them has been omitted .
In the current world situation , where the price of oil and other energy sources - gas , for example - is rising steeply but is subject to unpredictable swings that make it difficult to plan sensibly and estimate investment costs and when the energy demands of European countries are also rising , a report on the subject of biogas would appear to be an unusually timely document .

On the Weber report , I would like to say that I think illegal immigration should be considered as ipso facto presenting the possibility that people will abscond .

Even before the last developments , the Commission , together with Frontex , started to identify what can be done in the short and medium term .
Progress is being made .
The first requirement is that all these agreements include clauses compelling European investors to behave responsibly abroad in economic , social and environmental matters .
The risk of a wide gap is quite real .
As our rapporteur points out , we must not lose sight of the goals of the Process or of the notion of students being at the heart of all questions concerning their education .
I think that we must reconstruct the link , nowadays increasingly weak and fragile , between agricultural produce and food for everyday consumption ; that is to say , we must encourage consumers to be knowledgeable about the principles of a healthy diet and the seasonality of produce .
I think there is one good thing here : that we are all interested in research and know that it is Europe 's and the Member States ' only hope .
In Romania , more than 6 000 redundancies will be made in the rail transport sector during this period .

41 .
Although the Court approved this management , it still has some shortcomings that need to be addressed .
The European Union is an ideological project being forced upon European peoples who would rather live in democratic nation states .
I agree with the position of Parliament that this European Union strategic objective should also be pursued by cooperating closely with national governments , social partners and civil society , and that the European Parliament should be involved to a greater extent in its execution .
The reaction of France and the French Government was justified and proper , and our position should be equally resolute and severe .

( EL ) Mr President , without doubt , we need a common immigration policy and we need to reinforce our cooperation with third countries and make it more cohesive and effective .
Voting time
Mr Bonde , who makes such a racket here , was determined to be there at the signing of the Treaty .
When the Commission included in the recovery plan not only a fiscal endeavour but also ten priority actions for smart investments , what we were looking for was more growth , more sustainability and better quality employment than can be provided by some short - term measures .

This proposal , which we will hopefully adopt tomorrow , is a good start towards finally putting an end to the distortion of competition that has existed for many years , particularly in the border regions ; it is also good for the environment .
With regard to the comments from Mr Radwan and others on the financial crisis , clearly we are taking action to protect citizens , to protect savers , and to ensure that those responsible for the crisis in the various institutions have to pay for it .
Mr President , I have been in Burma and seen the misery and the oppression under which the Burmese people live .
I do not plan to measure the success of the summit by the length of the final joint declaration .
Madam President , thank you for your words of welcome , and thank you to every one of you for your good wishes and your encouragement .
All the more reason for providing appropriate work and safety conditions for just these workers .
He will surely give top priority to assessing and quantifying the damage and planning the massive effort that will be needed .
The EGF can and should be streamlined so that victims of collective dismissal do not have to wait 17 months for support which is declared to be urgent , as they have in this case .
This is in the interests of all Member States , but it is especially important for Hungary , which at present is reliant solely on Russian gas .
We will hit the ceiling in the multi - annual agreement for the budget in three headings , namely 1a for research , education and transport and Heading 3b for legal policy , and we will go beyond the ceiling in Heading 4 , foreign policy .
There is also the concept of smart meters and the imposition of a deadline for their roll - out , namely 10 years after the entry into force of the Directive .
The European budget is different from national budgets .
This delegation comprises 15 members of its ad hoc committee on direct elections and additional powers .
What Council unanimity means in practice is that essential legislation is either shelved or lowered to the level of the common denominator .
It is here , in adhering to these values and not simply to a geographical space , that the true essence of our Union lies .
I hope that you will honour your commitment to reach a first reading agreement with my Roaming II report .
In particular , this will mean regenerating the Mediterranean forest , the economic returns from which are too low : Structural Fund - supported initiatives must encourage the regular sampling of biomass and its use for energy purposes , and the development of sustainable forestry and responsible ecotourism .
The value of information collected in this way is undeniable in terms of assessing the situation in the labour market in the European Union , as well as for the functioning of the European Central Bank .
As for the method of electing this judge , the normal procedure provided for in the Convention should also apply here .
President - in - Office of the Council . - ( HU ) Mr President , honourable Members , I will also attempt to provide specific answers to the main subjects .
in writing . - I agree that the EU maintains a leading role in international climate policy .
That is not the point today .
This is an historic moment : will the Council , and particularly the United Kingdom , the Netherlands and Denmark , allow themselves to see that Europe is all about pooling resources to do better together ?
I am sure that the Commissioner will agree that these are exactly the kind of figures that will help to stimulate the economy and create jobs , not only throughout the United Kingdom , but also in India .
Why do we keep secret the names of the 407 Members who benefit from EUR 27 000 each paid into a voluntary pension fund , amongst them myself ?
For years it has been trying to do as it was told , upholding the rules on state aid , competition and procurement : rules which are essential components of the project but are now being ignored all round .
However , we found ourselves with a situation whereby the banks were no longer lending to each other , as they no longer had any money to lend , and the entire system was collapsing .
Europe must step up to the mark , and so must the European Parliament .
Commissioner , do you remember standing here just a few months ago , after the Palestinian delegation had returned from meeting Mr Haniyeh in Gaza , before the breakdown of the Palestinian Unity Government , saying to this House that you wanted to do everything you could to support that Government ?
Switzerland will come even closer to the European Union , and the EU will understand Switzerland better ; as our colleague Doris Pack mentioned , we will be able to anticipate better results in referenda .
Since the programme does not specify which policies it will follow in this connection , would the Presidency inform the EP precisely which steps it intends to take in this area ?
As you know , three people tragically and needlessly lost their lives during peaceful demonstrations by Greek citizens claiming a better tomorrow .
However , the euro does not sit in isolation .
We will continue , therefore , to work actively in Geneva and bilaterally to get a deal .
Accordingly , no Council representative is present today but that is not indicative of disregard of the European Parliament . The reasons for this absence are procedural ones .
I understand the attitude of our fellow Members from Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltic states in particular , who have suffered a great deal from Russian domination in the form of Soviet control and a harsh and oppressive system , which has now happily faded away .
I think that we have all found that cooperation is better and the dialogue between the Council and Parliament is closer , and I think it is also important that Commissioner Cecilia Malmström regularly informs the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs of the developments . I think this is the key to ensuring that good agreements do indeed continue to be reached in the future .
There is a certain amount of scepticism in Washington and elsewhere about how serious the European Union is about climate change .
After all , it is only a matter of protecting designs , not patents .
It is in this country that some very important battles are being fought in relation to drugs trafficking , the fight against authoritarianism and fundamentalism , and the establishment of the rule of law and democracy , which are , unfortunately , still very fragile .
This also applies to traditional means of control like the digital tachograph and the waybill , of which you are probably aware .
That is why we must impose strict , binding rules .
The regional dimension should therefore not be forgotten , but rather encouraged , whether through greater participation by regional and local entities , or through an increase in the role of urban and rural areas , as it is only through the stimulation of regional competitiveness that we will have solid competitiveness at global level .
In Algeria the government has restricted religious freedom for non - Muslims , and this has had a direct impact on Christians living in that country .
It is now three years since this Parliament said that the Council , the great absentee , should be involved in order to account for how it spends the greater part of the budget which it controls .
There is a close link between security , political stability and the economy .
I voted for this motion for a resolution which supports the dignity , welfare and development of every person as values which ought to be the main objectives of economic development .
Furthermore , I must energetically contradict those who have said that dairy products are too expensive .
That sounds great , Mr Harbour , but I still think that we have some work to do on our side , too .
Mr President , Commissioner , this week , US Senators Bernie Sanders and Sherrod Brown have written to the US Patent and Trademark Office to demand a thorough check to ensure that the wording of the negotiated ACTA agreement can be reconciled with existing US legislation .
At a time when the Communist authorities in Chişinău are continuing to hold on to power through deceit and torture , the prime minister of the country occupying the EU Presidency is content to describe the crisis at the EU 's borders as ' worrying ' .
( The oral amendment was accepted . )
Therefore , I suggest that the Commission consider not only those people at risk of losing their jobs , but also those who are finding it difficult to enter or return to the labour market .
That is not exactly the same in the case of oil , other energies or raw materials of all kinds .
Mr Sterckx has just spoken again of strategic partnership , and rightly so .
I would ask that my fellow Members kindly indicate with a show of hands who among you is willing to take this case seriously and take part in a detailed investigation .
Mr President , I wish to thank everyone who participated in this debate today .
We should give all the help we can with regard to public investment , particularly in these countries .
Mr Borloo will speak after the political groups , and Mr Borloo will speak again at the end of the debate .
We will also adjust the regulations for the funds accordingly , and lay the basis for a new cohesion formula : territorial cohesion , the framework for the period after 2013 .
The day after , let us not kid ourselves , it will be in Milan and , shortly after that , it will be in Brussels or Paris .
Firstly , the minimum age for supporting a legislative initiative has been fixed at 18 years old which is the minimum age for voting in European Parliament elections and as is required to participate in instruments of direct democracy , such as referendums .
Thank you for listening .
I hope that you will still be able to send out clear signals along these lines throughout the remainder of the Swedish Presidency .
In order to avoid negative consequences , Europe must be able to meet this challenge by setting out and implementing a policy of prevention that acts on the causes of economic and political instability in these countries , proposing shared solutions that can prevent or at least reduce the magnitude of the phenomenon .
My fellow Members rightly raised this matter and we need to find answers and to update the directive which we have applied to date .
My thoughts are also with the victims .
Some parties , for example , the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology , claim that these are - and I quote - ' non - critical items ' .
Furthermore , I agree that we should call on the Council to confirm its intention to officially adopt this law at the forthcoming European Council , in order to ensure a fair , adequate level of visibility for such an important initiative .
The debate is closed .
There are thousands of faceless civilians who still live and die in land contaminated by radiation : in Iraq , in Afghanistan , in Kosovo , in Bosnia , in Somalia , unaware of their fate .
In parallel , we are working with other members of the World Trade Organisation to obtain the necessary permission - a WTO waiver - which has to be granted before the measure takes effect .
Secondly , these Olympic Games are going to take place .
We have no choice .
Only this way will we be able to create a Europe which the new generations will see as an opportunity and not as a millstone .
Better coordination within the Commission is also urgently needed .
It has to do with the need to have some kind of division of labour in such an important area .
I believe that it does and that the sooner it takes action on this matter , the better !
Nevertheless , the furtive and back - handed introduction of divisive issues under cover of these very topics is turning into a regrettable habit .
We do not need to invent sophisticated indicators to observe that in the European Union there are governments where there is no woman or others that uncritically defend traditions and practices violating woman 's rights .
Agriculture and rural development are a further priority area for Europe .
The rapporteur writes , ' For the consumer affordability is a key issue .
By some fate of the calendar we are discussing this directive today , while we are voting on it tomorrow , which is World Autism Awareness Day .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am sorry for what happened earlier but I certainly had no intention of intimidating my fellow Member , and I offer my apologies to her .
- ( NL ) Madam President , I would also like to begin by thanking all of the rapporteurs for their extremely interesting reports .
In fact , the internet , for the first time in the world , has come to represent the exercise of a right and a fundamental freedom .

This provision refers explicitly and exclusively to complaints before the Court .
At the moment , the procedure works like this : you propose accession to the euro area , we are consulted , along with the Council comprising the Heads of State or Government , and then the Economic and Financial Affairs Council has to make a decision .
President - in - Office of the Council . - Mr Medina Ortega , the problems you were mentioning will not be resolved in a short period of time .
It is therefore entirely appropriate that two projects appeared on the European agenda at almost the same time , one concerning a Mediterranean Union and the other an Eastern partnership .
You know that I personally am not the kind of Commissioner who has a problem in regulating .
I would like to say in advance that sovereignty over water resources must remain a national matter .
It is quite a step forward , quite a step in the right direction to have this type of operation .
On that policy , the Presidency will stand up and fight .
The EU Solidarity Fund was created in order to demonstrate the European Union 's solidarity with the populations of regions devastated by disasters .
The report also takes account of scientific research in this area of veterinary science .
We have contributed throughout the committee and trialogue process to ensure that the Parliament 's preferred outcome is realistic , workable , and lasting .
I fully support the rapporteur , Mrs Swinburne , and her idea to promote competition between trading venues for execution services .
I am opposed to security policies which will help to militarise Africa .
First of all , I wanted to say to the Minister that I think we have already proved that the Community method works well .
Madam President , deliberate avoidance of economic governance and of banking regulation at both national and European level has delivered us into this crisis , and the crisis is obvious to everybody in terms of jobs , lack of growth , pensions lost , etc.
We want the title of subheading 1a , ' competitiveness for growth and employment ' , not just to be purely rhetorical , but also to include specific measures .
It is , therefore , natural that the protection of the watercourse and its broad surrounding area from pollution should be one of the key pillars of the privileged cooperation between the participating countries .
However , we need to understand that the very things that we all used to think belonged to the realm of fantasy and the film world - I read about them in story books when I was a child - are now knocking at our door , are a visible danger , a reality .
That means that the standards that Commissioner Barrot described here today , namely security standards for police cooperation , in the fight against illegal immigration and economic migration and for biometric data , are the agreed minimum standards which represent the rules of play .
I see our Union as enriching the countries when we enter , and I have yet to see an enlargement that has made our Union weaker .
The project 's cross - border nature means that the Espoo Convention must be adhered to , while the Member States involved must properly enforce the provisions of the directive on environmental impact assessments before granting an implementation permit .
Now , the approval of the budget authority is required .
Therefore , it should also be said loud and clear that there is something worse than no agreement and that is a poor agreement .
( PL ) Madam President , I have long since become used to the flagrant hypocrisy that prevails in this House .
The second issue concerns safety , and the health and safety of workers in particular .
Under these circumstances the pressure to improve the human rights situation in China is dwindling .
As we speak , 26 crew members of the fishing vessel Playa de Bakio have been seized off Somalia and perhaps , as my fellow Member said earlier in this House , we should not only show solidarity with their families , but also request the European Union to take action in this matter and to make every effort to free these fishermen .
Twenty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , we cannot allow certain governments to build new ones .
I want to assure you that we take the consultation very seriously .
Therefore , what we have here is simply a lack of proper coordination of European funds .
Only recently the Arctic region was the subject of the Arctic countries ' national security and research investigations .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , anti - dumping represents one of the most incisive instruments for defending commercial decency in the European Union in order to compete fairly on the market .
However , the Commission has presented here today a series of proposals and initiatives , some of which have already been implemented and others which will be implemented and which naturally will merit the Council 's full attention and effort .
This situation is particularly problematic when we know that such programmes can limit the government 's capacity to invest in development and when overly ambitious goals are set , particularly as regards inflation and the budget deficit .
The resolution fails to take any account of the political context or of the fact that the Israeli authorities need to be able to guarantee the security of their citizens .
This , however , does not depend only on the institutions introduced or modified by the Treaty ; it depends primarily on the political will of the leaders of the Member States .
This report deserves my vote in favour as it is absolutely desirable that it be adopted now , at first reading .
Since the Second World War , the fundamental principle in international relations was that aggression must not pay , or that political concessions should not be made to aggressors , but Moscow has been victorious and NATO humiliated , with the EU playing both sides .
Then there is the question of whether we can manage to do that during this legislative term or whether we should start with recommendations and then move on to legislation .
My second comment concerns the global battle for standards , especially environmental and social standards , and more specifically environmental standards .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , yes , I have seen the film Minority Report .
There is , however , another important issue : the budget also needs to be highly flexible and to be able to respond quickly to citizens ' needs , to people 's needs and to changing needs .
The agreement was signed on 4 November in Stockholm and ratified by the Croatian Parliament on 20 November .
This sets out a shared vision on the part of Africa and Europe on future cooperation with a view to promoting development in Africa and combating poverty .
We should also maintain a balance across the OSCE 's three dimensions - the political - military dimension , the economic and environmental dimension and the human dimension .
In particular , I am pleased that the European Parliament accepted the general approach of the proposal , which is to ensure the animal welfare legislation applicable to slaughterhouses is in line with the hygiene package which was adopted back in 2004 .
The second reason is the new situation since the people of Gaza have opened up the border .
What can we do , through better coordination , to ensure that corruption does not take hold over these systems ?
The only improvements sought by the various parties involved were for greater transparency , greater speed and better access for SMEs .
Opinion polls in Ireland , and indeed the government 's own research into the ' no ' vote , have outlined people 's concerns over workers ' rights , public services , militarisation and democracy , and these concerns are shared by millions of workers and families across the Union .
After the debate with the Commission , the Committee on Legal Affairs took a decision not to recommend the defence of Mr Tomczak 's parliamentary immunity on the above grounds .
So it has been difficult .
Without active civil societies and the rule of law there can be no stability in the long term .
Consumer protection , in particular protection of children , who are the most vulnerable group , is a priority for the European Parliament .
Now the military government has promised elections in 2010 as a step towards its gradual exit from power .
Therefore , I would ask , please , that we show ourselves capable of acting .
Written declarations ( Rule 116 ) : see Minutes
Now we pass the baton to the Member States and I hope they will commit themselves to it to the full .
So this is the way to go and this is what we are trying to do .
We are supposedly talking about liberalisation , but in fact what we are dealing with is a monopoly .
The scope of the revised Ecolabel regulation has also been extended .
on behalf of the PPE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing four reports in today 's debate , and so I would like to start by thanking all the rapporteurs for their work , and the European Commission for its cooperation .
In the autumn of 2007 , three accidents occurred , each involving Dash8 Q 400 aircraft in Aalborg , Vilnius and Copenhagen respectively .
On a personal note , I would like to say two things .
But we must bear in mind that not all problems can necessarily be solved through trade policy .
Nevertheless , inequalities still prevail and there are many battles yet to be fought , not least of which is a persistent wage gap and the place of women on the boards of large companies .
It is a testament also to the work of all our rapporteurs and MEPs who , over the years , have pushed for such legislation .
And when we look at domestic support , which is the most difficult issue for the Americans , it is obvious that they have now signalled that they will be able to operate within the gap or within the two figures mentioned in the Falconer paper .
Fourthly : mobility of staff is important in order to be able to make full use of educated people .
All I can say is that the Council will look closely at all elements of Parliament 's report with a view to making progress on these important measures in the shortest possible time frame .
The first partial toll of the huge fires that swept through large areas of the Peloponnese was 63 dead , over 40 000 head of cattle burnt to death , 250 000 olive trees burnt and hundreds of thousands of hectares of forest gone up in smoke .
However , diversity is a central feature of the European Union , and sometimes it requires political and institutional compromises .
Although I voted in favour of this proposal to provide assistance to the workers of Unilever in the Czech Republic , I believe that this is an analgesic and palliative measure for the consequences of the capitalist model , and that it does not represent any real progress in the fight against the root causes of the crisis .
As wine merchants put pressure on producers to lower their prices , they in turn cannot afford to pay the growers adequate prices for their grapes .
Any other solution may result in a situation where countries abandon reforms for fear of the financial burden .
Finally , we come to the lotteries .
The final findings of that study , which will soon be made available to the Commission , will provide the basis for a systematic monitoring of the existing acquis in this area , in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty .
This is blatant populism !
The statistical reports should be taken into consideration both by Eurostat and in particular by the national institutions and companies .
At the moment , too many young people are failing to utilise fully their potential in education and vocational training .
At the same time , the Commission must take into account , when a decision is being made on implementing projects pertaining to the Internet of Things , which network is going to be selected for connecting these objects .
This is something you need to look into , Commissioner .
For a long time , gender inequality in the labour market has been a very important subject for the EU , and for years , it has tried to find a solution .
The Commission has recognised the need for a transitional period for operators to achieve the efficient cost level .
( PL ) Mr President , respect for human rights is a fundamental task of the European Community .
I believe this is an area where , if Member States work together , Europe can ensure secure , cheaper and more efficient energy for its citizens .
The report clearly refers to the need to apply principles of subsidiarity and proportionality when implementing and managing flexicurity .
The question of expanding the framework of this directive should form the topic of further negotiations in the Council .
( ES ) Mr President , Mr President - in - Office of the Council , I also wish to make some remarks on the bluefin tuna issue , and more specifically on the closure of fishing grounds decreed by the Commission recently since the quota allocated to the European Union had been exceeded .
That was why we all delegated to Europe the national independence that we had prior to joining this project .
We also need to provide effective support , including financial support , for institutions which are important to setting up and developing civil society , such as independent non - governmental organisations , political parties and an independent press .
All the conditions that the Commissioner has told us would apply , in exactly the same way , to all the products I have just mentioned .
That is a scenario which it is still perfectly possible to avert .
But it is better than our sticking with the failed boycotting policy of the past decade .
In addition , Belgium had to deal with domestic problems during its Presidency .
We have not paid sufficient attention in our documentation to children who have left children 's homes at about 18 or 19 years of age : legally they are adults , although in social terms they are not ; this is an area which we should begin to focus some attention .
In practice this proposal gives state - aided railway companies the possibility of competing on a market where there is free competition , which in the long term poses the risk of deactivating market mechanisms .
Egypt , which has a particular responsibility due to its location on the border with Gaza , must take an active part in this negotiation process .
We should be involved in the nominations of ambassadors and EUSRs .
A thriving market with job security are not achievable within the context of the CFP , and control of fisheries management must be returned to the nations dependent on fisheries .
Given the current global economic situation , the leaders will naturally also discuss possible ways out of the crisis , of boosting growth and creating jobs , and the question of the regulation of financial markets will be particularly important .
We will see how many millionaires he gets to contribute to his campaign this time ; but I hope that this time there will be greater awareness , having seen their performance in the European Parliament over these last five years , of what it actually means when you elect somebody from UKIP to this place .
However , although we should welcome the fact that we can now break through the wall of indifference under international law , we must also ensure that all due precautions are taken to guarantee that military force remains a last resort .
How this will be done is not clear either .
Yes , there are problems and yes , as Minister Jouyet said , we must leave a margin so that we can respond to the crisis .
February 's annual report by the European Parliament on equality between men and women for 2009 says that , as a result of the economic crisis and the budget cuts in the EU countries , there have been job losses , particularly amongst women .
We should also pay close attention to the thoughts of Cándido Méndez , one of the principle figures in the Spanish agreement , who attended the meeting of the Economic and Social Council on Tuesday , 8 February in Brussels .
( NL ) Madam President , it is very important for the European Union to have an efficient and well - developed anti - fraud office , all the more so given how much budgets are increasing and foreign aid growing , without it always being possible to monitor effectively whether the deployed means are spent wisely .
Relations between Germany and Spain are strained to say the least , and yet , three weeks into this crisis , we still have no idea of where the source of this contamination has come from .
That Treaty does not introduce a specific legal basis , but gives the value of a European policy to the strategy we are discussing here today and which hitherto was based on a common political resolve .
In its communication the Commission considers circular migration to be a useful means to be developed at Community level to ensure more effective management of migration flows .
I hope that we will learn from the experience of last year 's meeting in Copenhagen and this year aim for achievable objectives instead of setting our sights on the impossible .
- ( FR ) Madam President , firstly I should like to pay tribute to the huge amount of work done by the rapporteurs .
( DE ) Mr President , this budget must sadden interested Europeans and will , I hope , outrage them when it comes to the European elections next June , for it is another expression of the simple failure by a Union that is , alas , in a state of paralysis to convey the message : yes , we have understood !
We must adopt the objective of a 30 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the EU by 2020 compared with 1990 levels ( paragraph 16 ) .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , by giving your support to this enhanced cooperation , as Mr Lehne is proposing , you will be taking a decisive step , if you like , towards making the lives of European businesses and inventors easier , thanks to what is at last unitary patent protection in Europe .
We have very good nuclear safety regulators in the Union , so an organisational shake - up is not necessary .
I can inform you that the Commission is currently working on a road map for visa liberalisation for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
We expect the Commission to perform its study on food very specifically so that any possibility of misunderstandings between this label and organic products can be ruled out .
Firstly , there is the earmarking of the revenue from road charges for investment in improved transport infrastructure , which is in the public economic interest and provides increased safety and better transport routes .
Member of the Commission . - Yes , it is true that we have been aiming to make a proposal in the autumn of this year , but you have to understand that , in a project as ambitious as the CCCTB , it is not possible to predict exactly when we will be ready to make the proposal , as the timing of the proposal depends on the finalisation of the impact assessments and its evolution by the Commission .
We put this challenge to our fellow Members .
It is also a matter of concern from the point of view of the free movement of labour within the European Union that people residing in the Member States of the EU will not want to move to another country or work abroad because it is impossible to arrange good , proper schooling and good quality teaching for their children there .
In the light of this development and the verifiable reality that these journeys are often undertaken in buses - criminal tourism - the question must be asked as to whether it would not make sense , in these circumstances , in addition to the drawing up of reports by Europol , Frontex and others , to re - introduce border controls in the relevant border regions and suspend Schengen for a limited period where necessary .
Can it be established , and , particularly , can we in Parliament do anything to help establish those facts ?
That , sadly , creates loopholes , especially with regard to the protection of flora and fauna , where offenders are not sentenced as a matter of course and many are able to escape by pleading ignorance .
Who will say ' We want to maintain peace throughout the world and ensure that conflicts do not turn into wars ' ?
We hope that , when it comes to the final vote , the spirit of compromise among the main political groups will enable the consensus reached on its main messages to be maintained so that there is broad final approval .
This approach must be implemented beginning with the research programme , which is a source of funding for new inventions , for the realisation of new ideas , and new jobs .
If we set the hurdles too high , we will be frustrating a major potential for Europe .
This is why a differentiated , country - specific approach is needed - it is not certain that what is good for Jordan will be good for Ukraine .
in writing . - The economic situation in Europe and further afield is as grave as any of us can remember , and it is absolutely right that the European Union and the Member States do everything that they can to ensure that a recession does not turn into a slump and that where government action really can kick - start economic activity , it should be allowed to do so .
The European Union , its Member States and its institutions had already condemned Moussa Dadis Camara 's coup d'état on 28 December 2008 .
( DE ) Mr Mölzer , do you think it is in good taste for the EU currently to be negotiating with Colonel Gaddafi over the return of refugees when there have been 40 people injured in demonstrations in Libya today ?
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , the people of Zimbabwe have suffered horrendously .
The motorway that is under construction in Transylvania could likewise cause serious environmental damage .
The amount proposed in the preliminary draft budget for the Frontex Agency has therefore been included .
On behalf of the Commission , I welcome the resolution on early diagnosis and early care of HIV / AIDS and fully endorse and support the principle of breaking down barriers to HIV testing , treatment and care .
The women with whom we spoke said it goes far beyond attacks on individuals ; it is not individual violence but rather an attack on the community , aimed at destroying its fabric .
But it also stressed the need to act in five key areas : promoting demographic renewal in Europe , by creating the conditions for our fellow citizens to fulfil their desire to have children , in particular , by helping to reconcile work and family and private life ; promoting employment in Europe , by ensuring that more and better jobs are created and people can work longer , in order to improve the balance between active and inactive people ; promoting a more productive and more dynamic Europe , by optimising skills at all ages ; taking in and integrating migrants into Europe , by attracting skilled and unskilled workers from abroad and facilitating their integration in order to alleviate labour shortages ; ensuring the sustainability of public finances , by consolidating budgets and reforming social protection systems in order to guarantee adequate social protection and public services in the future .
How would the Union be able to deal with such a request quickly , if this could be done ?
We thought , before all or some of the heads of delegation , that it would probably be best , for Parliament 's image , to get the text withdrawn and to vote next time ; the crisis , may I point out , will not be over by the month of June .
- Before the vote :
Equally , it is important to have tax incentives for energy saving : there I share his point of view .
Subject : Long - standing minorities
The other point you made , which is something that concerns the Council - and I here I will name no names - touches on a difficult subject , namely how to prevent offshore havens , whether overseas or on or near our continent .
Those who are not convicted should be treated as innocent .
Over the past few weeks in Slovenia , we had a totally inaccurate piece of news being spread by e-mail about Codex Alimentarius .
If this does not happen , then for transport - intensive areas like the port of Rotterdam and Schiphol airport , it will be impossible for us to meet the present and / or stricter norms for particulate matter .
Over the last few days , it has become clear that the Member States want to retain these powers .
Congratulations to their services , but these were national actions , and my question to the Commissioner is this : what about prevention at European level ?
The more the debate was focused on Europe , the larger the majority was .
The situation of women living in rural areas is generally more difficult ; they tend much more often to undertake hidden , unpaid work with no insurance or protection , for example on family farms .
What this really means is that more of the decisions on the shape , content and future of Europe should be taken by citizens , and not just by representatives of the government that happens to be in power .
Shore up endangered coastlines .
The disaster occurred in August and the first payments were received by the Czech Republic the following January .
Moreover , we should not overlook the fact that , in contravention of the roadmap , Turkey is allowing and , perhaps , encouraging the movement of illegal immigrants through its territory to the countries of the European Union and is not complying with its obligations to grant docking and landing rights to Cypriot ships and aircraft .
Lastly , public finances . The stability and growth pact affects both euro countries and non - euro countries .
In order to do so , Europe needs to make better use of its potential and to galvanise European citizens into action .
Respondents this time seemed predominantly producers rather than users , and with regard to users there were no questions on comparability .
In June 2009 , the Commission tabled the EU CBRN Action Plan , which was amended by the Council in November .
My second message is for the Commission .
I would highlight the potential value for citizens and businesses of the digital switchover of public services ( e-government ) in order to enable a more efficient and personalised provision of public services .
That is why I voted in favour .
N 1 vehicles are used by small businesses which are sensitive to price increases , and which are , at the same time , becoming ever more common on the market .

( SK ) Armenian Government representatives yesterday warned me that the report on the need for an EU strategy for the South Caucasus , in the section dealing with the conflict in Nagorno - Karabakh , includes formulations which do not conform to the official EU position as set out in the provisions of the declaration adopted by the foreign ministers of all OSCE states , and the provisions of the declaration issued by OSCE ministers in Athens on 2 December 2009 .
This must be a key element in any counter - terrorist strategy .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I should like to apologise at the outset that I have to leave after my speech because I have to be at a meeting with President Pöttering .
Such measures as increasing energy efficiency , using energy from renewable sources and improving the EU 's energy security feature among the Swedish Presidency 's priorities .
Nevertheless , we strongly oppose the second part , in particular Amendment 58 , which intends new labelling requirements to be introduced at Union level .
Anyone with even a modicum of economic education will be familiar with the economic principle that specialisation and trade are the very driving force behind economic growth .
The quality of candidates , however , must also take precedence over their sex .
On the Commissions side , we have already indicated to the Polish authorities our position in assessing the compensatory measures needed to comply with EC state aid rules .
We should develop the agricultural industry instead of tending to run it down , which has been the case in politics in recent years .
Many thanks to you all and I hope we will all see each other again .
They are damaging !
Mr President , there are threatening signs of the revival of racism , homophobia and anti - Semitism in many countries of the EU .
In relation to this , we have to ask how to approach the new strategy .
Therefore , I am calling on the Commission to subject nanomaterials to a detailed investigation .
At the same time , I am pleased with the increased attention being given to energy efficiency in buildings , which has been included as a priority in the European Economic Recovery Plan and mentioned in Mr Reul 's report as a solution for reducing the demand for fossil energy resources .
I should like to say that this is a report that is based on the principle of subsidiarity .
George Orwell could not have imagined it ; we have long overtaken his vision of a surveillance society .
Those are the reasons why we voted against .
This is a sign of concrete solidarity .
But we have had bad experiences of OLAF , including a lack of independence , a lack of transparency , secret lobbying in connection with the appointment of the director general and the Supervisory Committee .
We also know that controlling energy consumption in Europe and using energy from renewable sources constitute important parts of the package of measures needed to combat climate change .
Such a programme must allow the exchange of best practices , create a joint strategy and reduce the costs of resettlement operations .
That , after all , is what really counts .
It will also provide an emphatic reminder of the need to develop important paths for the preparation of new strategies , jointly approved by the Member States , to be submitted in the autumn of 2008 .
I believe that this is a major development .
President - in - Office of the Council . - I think on the CAP reform we were among those who were trying to push the Commission to come forward with the new budgetary reform proposals , the white paper .
I should like to ask my fellow members to place their trust in this directive .
A parliament that wants to be taken seriously must be open to these new conditions and changes .
The debate is closed .
The approach taken by the US authorities and the fact that the courts do not view the publication of names , e-mail addresses and banking details as a violation of privacy are certainly symptomatic of overseas data protection provisions , which are obviously still in their infancy .
I can support your amendments and those related to the alignment of the proposal with the new control regulation , in force since January 2010 .
I would like to speak of the fate of parliamentarians who today are imprisoned in Burma , both the members of parliament who were arrested in the autumn of 2007 and those who disappeared or died in unknown circumstances , when they were arrested , as well as those who were assassinated and who died in unexplained circumstances .
So this is how the Commission sees those issues .
I would also like to hear a commitment from you in relation to the legislative programme that the Stockholm Programme will implement in the area of justice , security and freedom .
In fact , Catherine Ashton admitted yesterday during the meeting we had as part of the Committee on Foreign Affairs that the approach based on human rights dialogues needs to be reviewed .
It should produce an umbrella , it should produce some control , but it should also give individual choice so that individual citizens can begin to feel in control again in these times of uncertainty .
Last but not least , I would like to congratulate the Slovenian Presidency on the excellent result that we have achieved .
I will go even further and say that the social costs of the loss of strength in this sector are of absolutely fundamental significance .
That is the answer that we must give if we truly wish to start rooting out the hatred and the violence .
We are fighting corruption .
I think that further dialogue is needed .
Banks and funders will have to take risks on green technology start - ups .
We are not thinking in terms of the generations existing alongside each other , but in terms of them coming together .
( Applause )
However , the priest made it clear that , although the situation has worsened in recent years , it is also because the influence of Islamic extremism as expressed by the ideology of Al-Qaida has spread to Nigeria , and in particular to 12 states in the north that have adopted sharia as the law of the land .
Madam President , we agree with the views expressed on the subject of renewable energies and their integration into the European energy network .
I agree entirely with this , but I would like to add that it is also required by the fact that the crisis did not arise in the new Member States and they are not responsible for the turbulence in the financial markets , and so giving them aid is fully justified .
This is a very difficult problem to solve , but I hope that we can find an effective solution .
However , that principle of give and take should also be applied , in terms of symmetry , to this Parliament eventually adopting a position on this package .
( FR ) Madam President , with this financial crisis , the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum will fade into the background .
It is now up to European governments to look into the budgetary possibility for taking on such a change and accepting it .
The constitutional process is an ideal opportunity to draw up a new civilian constitution , with the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms at its heart .
I think the answer is yes .
in writing . - I supported this report which evaluates the management of H 1N1 influenza and calls for a joint procurement mechanism for vaccinations .
This matter is especially important for Poland , which will hold the EU Presidency in 2011 .
This has to be our approach to the developing world .
in writing . - I am supportive of extending the coastal limits from 12 to 20 miles as one of the key reforms of the CFP .
What I take from Mrs Gottardi 's report on public finances is that it has learned no lessons from the world crisis .
Therefore , no country is exempt from violations being condemned by right - and I would even say out of moral obligation - and we do condemn and should condemn these violations when they take place within the European Union or in one of its countries .
As regards the achievability of the goals , I still have doubts .
Finally , when does the Commission plan to transmit to Parliament the revised regulation for the next phase of GSP ?
Thank you for the good coordination !
We also need to ensure that we do not turn in on ourselves .
Furthermore , the tenets of increasing competitiveness contained in the report are fundamental to the strategy .
We have to be idealistic in this life .
The two amendments do not preclude one another .
It is scandalous that children are left to live on their own at all .
Opening of the sitting
At a time of crisis the airlines are saving themselves by asking for these limits , just as we have said here , to be extended into next year .
That is the core of our action plan .
The railways proved not to be a viable alternative .
It is not countries with competition that have an unregulated gambling market .
- Report : Mayer
Mr President , this report is about active dialogue with citizens , and the best kind of active dialogue with European citizens is one based on listening to what they say in democratic votes .
Regarding the TEC and what its agenda might be , we are currently working with our US counterparts to fix the final agenda for the next TEC meeting , bearing in mind the input from advisers .
The compromise package agreed in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is far from perfect but marks a significant improvement and a base upon which we can build in negotiations with the other institutions .
I have no doubt that we will be able to count on your suggestions , on your proposals .
I voted in favour of this European Parliament own - initiative report , which responds to the European Commission 's analysis of penalties for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport .
I do not think that , just because we have many important commercial links , we have to stay silent on this issue - on the contrary .
We have goods and services worth EUR 50 billion crossing the ocean annually .
In my opinion , we are letting some opportunities go to waste with the present mobilisation of the EGF .
That is fine but then he should please be here on time to submit his view to Parliament .
I think we can be confident that there are guarantees for the future that ad hoc political measures will be superfluous .
Let me now come back to the issue of financial speculation .
President - in - Office of the Council . - Mr President , let me introduce the debate on the progress reports on the three countries Croatia , Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
In addition to the human rights dialogue , the EU also regularly raises issues of particular concern with the Vietnamese Government .
Ten minutes in total is an unaccustomed luxury , and I am not sure I will be able to use it .
I would like also to mention the idea of a colleague , Mr Mayor Oreja , which is to compose a list of victims with whom the EU external services should actively make contact .
As a member of the Committee on Budgets , I would like to point out the third problem that the EU needs to solve , namely improving the coordination of Community and Member States ' resources with a view to making them easily accessible for the victims of humanitarian disasters .
One particularly tragic aspect of this was that those people who were particularly hard hit by the Iron Curtain were the same people who had suffered most under National Socialism .
The euro is a success , no - one doubts that .
First part
The European Union , rather than lament the fact that Italy has not asked for funding , should take note of what President Barroso said , in other words that if a Member State allows slums to develop on its territory , what can it expect the Commission to do ?
At the same time , I should like to remark that the title of ' human rights defender ' does not give Mr Orlov the right to accuse the President of the Republic of Chechnya of murder .
Its purpose is to improve social welfare .
These countries are backward too and are asking for help , insisting that they should receive assistance .
Or at least win back the credibility you have lost since September 2009 !
Indeed , the report 's provisions do not exclude other areas .
Only one month has passed since Hungarian extremists in fascist uniforms marched across the border into a peaceful Slovak town to the horror of local people .
The sheep , lamb and goat sector has had a rough ride over the last ten years as a result of a series of crises , including epizootic - type diseases , but more especially because of the decoupling of aid , which has led to a marked decline in the sheep and lamb population as breeders quit the industry .
I am afraid it is not yet fit for purpose .
Seven hundred and eighty cubic metres of fuel were pumped off the vessel in the month following the incident , none of which was spilt .
I have raised this issue on a number of occasions .
The proposal for a European ' Blue Card ' should be developed and discussed further , along with the idea of a circular immigration project for unskilled workers .
( HU ) Mr President , I must first of all point out how regrettable it is that the EU 's earlier target of increasing the share of renewable energy in the EU 's energy mix to 12 % by 2010 will in all likelihood not be met .
In this respect , we must encourage cooperation between Member States .
in writing . - ( DE ) After ten years of beating about the bush , we still cannot agree on effective methods with which we can put a stop to VAT fraud - which , after all , involves the evasion of taxes equivalent to between 2 and 2.5 % of Europe 's economic output .
Let me stress that ACTA will not change the EU acquis .
This is a record to be proud of and I would like to congratulate Mr Diamandouros .
It is regrettable that this resolution is being used as a pretext for safeguarding the so - called common energy policy and its objectives of liberalising the energy sector .
ICTs can , in actual fact , significantly reduce CO 2 emissions .
If this report is adopted , I fear that there will be even fiercer criticism from the public .
The adoption of this new tool will make it easier for these people to access the capital required to set up or develop a business and make their dreams of entrepreneurship come true .
An increasing number of companies are relocating , taking advantage of reduced labour costs in a number of countries , particularly China and India , with a damaging effect on countries that respect workers ' rights .
The Schengen Information System will only ever be a useless gadget as long as the dangerous Schengen agreements are in place .
I am saying that I share your ambition but I am not seeing the goals being put into practice .
Turning to higher education , the Commission recently launched , as you know , Youth on the Move - a Europe 2020 flagship initiative which sets out to make education and training more relevant to young people 's needs .
Well , in the UK we measure inflation and our inflation rate has supposedly gone up to 3.3 % , as announced earlier this morning .
We are in permanent contact with the Secretary - General of the United Nations to see how this can be done and I hope very much that in a few days I will be able to report to you that progress has been made .
Likewise , nobody forced us to hesitate and falter when the so - called ' peripheral ' economies come under attack .
I feel that the EU must show greater solidarity and provide the Member States with full assistance to enable them to join the club of euro area countries and become fully - fledged EU Member States .
No one has sought to prejudge what the Hungarian constitution will be or how it will be applied in practice and it will , of course , be subject to the checks and balances provided by the constitutional system , the constitutional balance of the Hungarian constitution itself and the fact that Hungary is subject to supranational bodies such as the Council of Europe and the European Union , which know about fundamental rights .
On the contrary , it is part of the solution .
Unfortunately , there is no peace to keep at the moment but , nevertheless , the international community , including the UN and the European Union , have a responsibility to try to help secure this region as soon as possible so that peace can be realised in the future .
These irregularities are accompanied by many irresponsible acts .
It is very important to establish a system for legal migration , taking account of the needs of Europe 's labour market and the capacity of each Member State to receive and integrate immigrants .
The ERDF stimulates economic development and recovery in less prosperous parts of the EU .
However , the consultation with the Commission over this directive has also uncovered other issues .
Social package ( Second part : Cross - border healthcare ) ( debate )
( RO ) It is my firm belief that this draft directive marks significant progress in terms of speeding up access to medicines .
If we want the European Union to be a strong and respected presence on the international stage and its actions , including as regards sanctions , to have the biggest possible impact , it is essential to demonstrate great solidarity and avoid using different units of measurements .
Maybe that is an area where we could better invest the EUR 55 million .
( EL ) I understand that you are unable to present proposals to resolve the acute problems faced by the workers both in your country and in the other 26 Member States of the European Union .
In the past , all information , packets and bits of data were treated equally .
I should like to stress the important role that the European Aviation Safety Agency will play as regards the monitoring not just of aviation but also of company practices .
Each country produces its leaders and experts , its technicians , bankers , sportsmen and women and all the rest of the range of skills that are enhanced by training .
I have test - driven several of the environmentally friendly cars .
However , I will say this : there are levels at which I cannot be insulted and where I do not see it as an insult either , because in order to insult me , someone must have a certain degree of sincerity .
Mr President , we must indeed not just listen to the Irish result but reflect and digest it .
The hearing , organised jointly by the Commission and the Slovene Presidency , marked the start of a process , and the Commission is determined to pursue this process step by step .
Thirdly , it is time to set up a regional navigation information centre for the Black Sea , which will contribute to the security of transport routes and , generally , navigation in the region .
Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to welcome and give the floor to Mr Georgiou , who is a new Member of the European Parliament .
The Arctic is not some sort of theme park or museum : it is a living , breathing community with its own modern economy and at the heart of that is what is taken from the seas .
For this reason , the report stresses that the EU needs to fully implement its commitments in this field .
The next item is a short presentation of the report by Mrs Kósáné Kovács , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the social situation of the Roma and their improved access to the labour market in the EU .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Thank you to those who voted for me ; I will do everything not to disappoint your trust .
How can we rid ourselves of these double standards ?
Stateless people are a separate issue and should be encouraged , using all means available , to apply for citizenship in their host country .
Vice - President of the Commission . - Within the framework of the third European Action Programme on Road Safety up to 2010 , a number of actions were implemented to combat speeding , drug and drink driving as well as to improve road infrastructure .
It is about how we make sure that it is a thread that runs all the way through all our actions in terms of support for the work that we are doing across the world to promote the values of the European Union .
The fourth and final point - which I believe is very important to consider - is that it should be a global agreement , and not just an agreement among certain regions , and this has to happen by means of a process rooted in democratic participation involving all countries .
We are preparing an e-mail for all Members .
In fact , there is no scientific evidence to show that adding docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) to milk substitutes improves visual development .
Today we are discussing the Ecolabel scheme .
Europe must be united and strong in order to be a real presence at the tables of the world 's leadership .
16 .
( BG ) Thank you , Madam President .
On the basis of the responses to the Green Paper and many discussions with stakeholders , a number of actions have been identified and will be launched later this year .
Climate change is a crucial part of the broader agenda on sustainable development .
The vote will be held at 12.00 .
Competition is very tight , and it simply cannot be possible for an individual company - or even an individual Member State - to put in place measures which distort competition without the European Commission taking care to prevent the distortion in question .
I remain open to considering this at any future stage of the codecision process .
I feel that we in the EU , along with the other members of the G 20 , have made great progress on a number of central issues that are crucial if we are to provide a strategic response to the economic and financial crisis .
In 2006 half of all products sold in the EU that were deemed hazardous to health were manufactured in China .
It makes our labour markets less competitive and less flexible .
in writing . - At the heart of the financial crisis were banks taking excessive risks and failing to hold enough capital to cover those risks .
Honourable Member , what you said reflects my own thoughts precisely .
Europe is the region with the greatest buying power .
To ensure that basic principles of data protection are respected and that PNR data is only used for specific law enforcement purposes , the EU has signed agreements with a number of countries on the transfer and the use of PNR data .
I , personally , am absolutely convinced that austerity measures are not the only way out of this crisis .
I do not agree with that .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the decision by the European Union to support the recognition of the Mediterranean diet as Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO reminds us , above all , of the right to protection of the identities of peoples in their close relationship with their lands .
The information required therefore needs to be diffused and used .
None of them are panaceas and all of them must apply to all continents .
Observing the fact that free trade agreements still generally contain few references to social standards , the report mentions a number of avenues , including the social clause and compliance with International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) conventions - whether or not they have been ratified already by all Member States . - and enhancing cooperation between third countries and Member States .
A famous American professor , Larry Diamond , has recently called attention to a worrying phenomenon he calls " democratic recession " .
I need not describe that here in detail .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I know that I will not be popular for making a long speech at this time , but my two fellow - rapporteurs , with whom I have worked very closely as a team , have made short statements so I want to keep the team spirit together .
We have learnt to meet each other half way and to work together more closely .
Fighting counterfeiting and piracy is an issue that should continue to be at the top of our political agenda .
I must say we were amazed by the number of applications received .
Different aspects of production and products , such as the ones mentioned in the question , like cosmetics and medicines , are already subject to various Community provisions , albeit not specific to nanotechnology .
Therefore , this is a timely issue .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , an equitable and efficient system should guarantee access to education for everyone .
Among the many actions proposed and the various objectives the Commission has set itself in the attempt to bring about a real Innovation Union , one of the most innovative elements is represented by the so - called ' Innovation Partnerships ' .
I want to thank those who drafted the report for their versatile efforts , and for bringing what is an important issue to the heart of the debate .
The next item is Question Time ( B 6-0168/2008 ) .
To that extent , what we have just heard from the previous speaker was quite absurd , given that this topic is mentioned very frequently in the resolution .
It therefore requires progress on the last two proposals .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , the first time I dealt personally with this issue was during NATO 's war of aggression against Yugoslavia , one of the wars which I opposed and which like many other wars was waged by Western countries .
In 2009 , heavy rain led to severe flooding which caused serious damage to the agricultural sector , residential properties and businesses , to the road network and other infrastructure .
I would like to make this very clear : the changes that have now been made are not enough .
Do you accept the challenge , Mr Reinfeldt ?
I welcome the Berlato report on the possibility of extending the financing of the Community Tobacco Fund until 2012 .
We do not yet know the implications of this decision , which is based on an emotional reaction to reconstituted meat and not on a scientific assessment of the actual enzyme .
Small and medium - sized enterprises create the most jobs in Europe but experience particular problems exporting .
Implementing measures ( Rule 88 )
We have made it clear in the resolution , once again , that we continue to challenge the repeated use of funds from the European Social Fund to finance the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and I insist , Commissioner , that you confirm today , once again , that this will not ultimately be at the expense of payments from the European Social Fund .
The next item is the Commission 's statement on the situation in Tibet .
A debate that is focused solely on the drudgery of imposing sanctions will not make Europeans want to get involved again with their Member States in the project .
The Commission and I have to admit that the aquaculture sector deserves greater recognition of its assets and values .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , we have known for many months that Greece is in a very difficult position .
These agreements , which are essentially trade agreements , create new platforms for parliamentary dialogue and are to be respected .
What we must ensure - and this is why we want to invoke our parliamentary powers of scrutiny - is that this collected data is truly unconnected with any private speculative ambitions but that is actually used , as you have said , for the sole purpose of harvest and yield forecasting .
I therefore have no problem agreeing when our Group 's shadow rapporteur , Mrs Sommer , draws attention to a strategy for preventing the dangers associated with alcohol .
I should also like to emphasise that the Commission engaged extremely constructively in the negotiations .
For example , the Russian South Stream pipeline supported by the State and by certain EU countries is in danger of ousting Nabucco , which is twice as cheap and which , for its part , acts in accordance with the rules of the market .
According to the report by the European Commission , it would only have been banned in spray paints , but yet again , upon a recommendation from the Socialists , it has also been restricted in aerosol cleaning materials .
The alternative thresholds , however , must lead to the conclusion that an area in question is affected by a significant handicap , as desired by the Council .
It has a new College of Commissioners , a new organisational structure guiding the European Union , and a new legal status : the European Union is now a single entity , called ' the European Union ' , with its own legal personality , and not a sum of different nations .
It is good that the European Parliament is advocating the systematic inclusion of human rights issues in the agenda of the EU 's political dialogues and external policy .
In the new relationship between Europe and Africa , there can be no one leader as Africans must be responsible for their own destiny .
The decision to create an innovation partnership linked to an action that will see the private sector - and , I hope , also Parliament and the other institutions - participating in innovation and research with the aim of identifying robust recycling and substitution measures yielding real results is not just an announcement , but a specific measure on the part of the European Commission .
It is important for the Member States to fulfil their obligations to increase the amount of Official Development Aid ( ODA ) , but the European Union should not legally penalise its Member States because of a partial failure to fulfil obligations in the changed context of the financial crisis .
We must also mention the Turkish authorities ' inexplicable insistence on keeping the Theological School in Halki shut .
If you act at European level with the same energy and the same determination , you will also bring this modernisation drive to Europe .
The question also remains as to what has happened to the Council 's response to the Fava report , Parliament 's comprehensive report on the CIA and certain practices that have been used in the fight against terrorism .
In this case , however , it is a matter of an adjustment on account of storm damage in France and Portugal caused by storm Xynthia .
In any case , however , we must applaud the work of Mr Peterle in the hope that the EU will take more extensive measures in the fight against this disease .
Moreover , tourism represents a strong growth engine for Europe .
The cornerstone of the EU exit strategy from the capitalist crisis is to impose sweeping changes in social security systems , to increase the retirement age and to drastically cut wages , pensions and social benefits .
Now that we are at the half - way mark regarding MDGs , it is critical that EU Member States continue to progress to 0.7 % GNI by 2015 .
In addition , public executions encourage aggressive behaviour amongst the population .
Our package will complement the proposals presented last year on the energy internal market .
Are there any proposals from the Council with regard to putting together a team of facilitators to allow the different traditions in Bosnia - Herzegovina to come together to agree a common standard or common code for how the police force should work ?
It would appear that this year 's conciliation between Parliament and the Council will be even more challenging than was the case in 2010 .
We have to ask ourselves how we can make progress jointly with other states .
In fact , we are subject to a demographic study only by an unjustified simplification and ignorance of what we are .
I support an overwhelming vote for this resolution and I urge you not to forget the despicable behaviour of those who knowingly caused the tragic loss from tobacco - related diseases of so many lives .
I should therefore like to encourage the Commissioner not to leave matters at that , and to take the initiative once more , the right of initiative he has in the next few years to abolish this restriction of cabotage yet .
Here in Europe we still have a lot to address .
The EU is like a building under construction and therefore , the notion of halting its enlargement would run counter to the very principle it is based on .
It was not - because I noted your regret - that it was released just after the Commission had released the documents .
Full democracy does not appear overnight .
My question to the Commission is : instead of fine words about one voice , are you prepared to lay claim to that role and , if need be , to push the Council aside ?
on behalf of the S&D Group . - Mr President , in this day and age , no one should be dying from TB .
In addition , since Eurofor includes a large contingent of French forces , it is essential to distinguish between the Épervier plan and the European forces .
These evaluations are ongoing , so it is too early to assess the state of play of the preparations .
Ultimately the question is how many more poor workers do we want there to be in the European Union ?
Firstly the immediate creation , in the relevant countries , of cereal stocks to be made available to farmers at a subsidised price .
We do not do justice to ourselves with emotive , hysterical or populist responses to the latest peer - reviewed scientific developments , and we do not do justice to our democratic mandate .
And I have not mentioned all of them .
These standards form an important basis for the discussions on free trade agreements .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , it is a sign of the importance that this House attaches to our strategic relationship with China that this debate has been scheduled during your inaugural session .
( RO ) Madam President , global warming , drug trafficking , the non - proliferation of weapons and energy security are common challenges requiring global solutions .
This regulation will apply to all long - distance ( 250 km or more ) regular , national or cross - border services from spring 2013 onwards .
Calling for one product to be banned will not solve the problem of irresponsible drinking .
In our report we are also much more cautious about reopening the discussion about national fit - in systems and other systems .
We also know that there are currently many specific agreements on data sharing between the US and the Member States , and between the US and the EU .
Mr President , Mrs Kratsa - Tsagaropoulou asked me about liquidity .
I would like to conclude with a few comments on Parliament 's recommendation on the development of EU criminal justice , which is the subject of the report by Ms Pagano .
We therefore need to give ourselves every chance to experiment with this technology and demonstrate how reliable it is .
in writing . - ( PT ) This is yet another part of this energy package .
Amendment of Regulation ( EC ) No 663/2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy (
However , while the process has not been perfect , we must not let this delay our work to close the gap between us and our economic partners .
In Europe , our citizens fear for their safety , and with good reason .
Nonetheless , we hope it will go ahead .
Tens of thousands of members of the Roma population were subjected to torture or murdered in the Occupied Eastern Territories and thousands more died in the Nazi regime 's concentration camps .
On the universal service part , I hope that the Commissioner will find a way of ensuring that the telecom operators , which will now profit from new investment possibilities will , for their part , invest to make sure that all citizens have access to broadband in the future .
One small example is Austria , where the income divide is about 28 % .
The PSE is of the opinion that this is not the end of the story ; it is a new beginning .
Finally , the Council meeting on 11 February , the day after tomorrow , which was mentioned by Mr López Garrido , among others , is a very important meeting .
In 2008 , having seen all his attempts to get somewhere with the other authorities fail , Mr Klein , the manufacturer , turned to the Committee on Petitions .
Dates of forthcoming sittings : see Minutes
( EL ) Madam President , as you are well aware , while we are debating the results of the informal European Council , the entire Greek workforce , down to the last man , is on strike in protest against precisely these measures , against precisely these results .
We hope that you will protect the rights of dissidents and , in particular , that you will attach great importance to respect for these Rules of Procedure , which should not be systematically amended , since it is clear that they can benefit those who are , I believe , the true defenders of the freedoms of the European nations .
I have a number of legitimate questions about how the Council can bring this into line with existing treaties , because in some cases , restrictions on the free movement of capital and payments are not permitted or wanted .
As you know my colleague Commissioner Connie Hedegaard has already embarked on a programme of outreach .
in writing . - ( SV ) The June List has chosen to vote in favour of the report , as we are of the opinion that it will go some way to providing the opportunity to unite requirements for efforts at national level with regard to health policy with a free internal market .
This desire to artificially create such a market does not manage to conceal one of the main aims of the manoeuvre : forcing the states to harmonise their taxes and regulations so as to be prepared for all contingencies or imposing a 28th legal order , a supranational order , accompanied , for good measure , by the adoption of the euro by the countries that rejected it , thereby enabling them to participate fully in this hypothetical market .
In my opinion , even though Frontex was not established for humanitarian reasons , it cannot be dissociated from this context ; it cannot be dissociated from the fact that we are facing a major humanitarian problem .
Since I was a Member of the European Parliament for many years , I must say I am delighted with the enormous effort made by the whole of Parliament , and particularly the rapporteurs , to move swiftly to adopt such an important piece of legislation .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , today we find ourselves discussing organ transplants , which is , without doubt , one of the most positive aspects of progress in the sphere of health , but which also opens up a series of problems concerning the rights of the donor and the patient , which must be dealt with on ethical , social , legal and economic levels .
Fifthly , I am pleased that the Director General of OLAF is being reappointed .
Lastly , we expect the Commission , Madam President , to provide a proactive framework to maintain the competitiveness and the very existence of the European automotive industry .
How will you organise that from here on in ?
All of Europe was recently appalled by those parts of Carla Del Ponte 's book where she spoke of Albanian terrorists who used Serbian citizens from Kosovo for commercial transplantation .
This is , then , a clear signal .
The adoption of this report in plenary indicates a path which the European Union seems to want to go down .
in writing . - IN FAVOUR .
4 .
This all calls for tightening up of the definitions and principles of procedure related to ensuring security on the territory of the Union .
The latter , far from advancing towards a just and sustainable peace , is worsening as we watch and is poisoning international relations , when it is not threatening the cohesion of our societies .
By means of strengthening these safeguards , we hope to enhance the confidence of European citizens in European institutions .
This is , in short , the responsibility that the Member States , the European Council , the Commission and Parliament too inherit from the Portuguese Presidency .
We cannot complete the European Union with inertia or fine words or simply from common ground .
A major and important step towards complete equality is a new and modern piece of EU legislation on maternity leave .
Let me underline one point : pacta sunt servanda !
However , the good news is that there has already been improvement .
I am referring , in particular , to the security problems affecting the areas in the immediate vicinity where the alliance can play a key role in the creation of democratic defence and security institutions in the Balkans and extended region of the Black Sea .
Well , there are a small number of points , but some of them are important in terms of content .
This is , in fact , what we are dealing with .
That is why I am going to avoid too much introverted institutional navel - gazing and think about action to improve the lot of our citizens .
The European Parliament could then have participated fully , but as you are aware , that is not yet possible .
It is therefore necessary and expedient to review the framework agreement that governs relations between Parliament and the Commission .
Europe , which , in the future , will receive ever more investment , particularly from emerging countries , must guard against such abuses .
First , information about the 21 Member States and the concrete reasons why the reasoned opinion was sent is public information , so anybody who wants can get that information .
It is a few years too late and , because of this delay , the European Commission is , of course , getting caught up by one political reality after another .
Many thanks , Commission President .
Over the past weeks and months , I have listened with interest and indeed approval to the discussions regarding the Danube Strategy and the Baltic Strategy , but never a word did I hear about an Atlantic Strategy .
These differences should be rectified with the help of development programmes financed by the EU .
That brings us up against the question : what are we as a European Parliament doing to calm the situation down ?
While the report is welcome , certain areas remain unclear ; for example , whether existing wilderness areas or potential future wilderness areas are being discussed .
Interoperability has therefore become a fundamental concept for information and telecommunications networks .
The sector employs directly 12 million EU citizens and an additional 26 million jobs in other sectors are dependent on it .
Do you have a date when these measures will be in place ?
Yet the European Parliament does not have a position on nuclear power .
This is a very important point to make in order to safeguard European taxpayers ' money .
Mr President , I am pleased that in this report the European Parliament is supporting the creation of the Global Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Fund .
I propose in that regard that , where some increase in payments is inevitable , it is offset by significantly lower appropriations .
Given this , I believe it is absolutely vital for the EU to safeguard sufficient financial and technical resources for decommissioning Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Plant in Bulgaria , as advocated by Parliament in this resolution .
Today in plenary , we adopted by a very large majority a resolution condemning failures in protection of human rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
Mr President , we are talking here about the safety of food for humans and the safety of feed for animals .
An end must be put to high risk speculation through a financial transactions tax .
However , we are using the time with a view to incorporating this into an amendment .
Following the agreement with the African Union and after opening a debate with the Russian Federation on the issue of raw materials , I shall travel to Latin America at the beginning of June to discuss the raw materials issue with Brazil , Argentina and Chile .
It takes two to tango .
This should be stated very clearly in this House today , particularly since we expect that the consultations and cooperation on events in North Africa may prove to be a key aspect of good cooperation with Turkey .
If there is a need to strengthen the system of fines , we will definitely follow this advice very carefully , because , basically , fines should be imposed in a way that prevents violation of the law , not just so that companies can shrug them off or pass the cost on to consumers .
Ladies and gentlemen , in 2006 the European Union devoted 39 % of its budget , EUR 38.9 billion in all , to structural spending .
I am amazed to see that even from the conclusions of yesterday 's Ecofin Council this method is still not being used .
This is because the least that can be said is that in the UfM , there is currently a signal lack of clarity .
Second , Mr Commissioner , while saying ' yes ' , we need more flexibility , and ' yes ' , we want to have more emphasis on the results and the inputs , how is that compatible with calling for a 10 - year financial perspective when we see the results of a mid - term review are entirely fruitless in this kind of exercise that we are going through ?
It is a European punishment mechanism , with the International Monetary Fund playing bad cop .
Indeed , at the time you started drafting no - one could have guessed what the world would be like today , nor what challenges the countries and people of the entire Arab region would be facing .
1 .
This is why I would like to offer my particularly enthusiastic support to Mr Piecyk 's report , in order to be able to discuss the issue of bus and coach transport and to vote in June .
Also , now that we have a new treaty , we need to respect the competences of each institution .
I am not saying this out of a desire to repeat the reasons given by those of us who supported the creation of Economic and Monetary Union 10 years ago , but due to the analysis of what has happened in that decade and of what we must do now , in these very difficult economic times .
In the context of this programme , several assessments have been conducted .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my thanks once again for your cooperation and for your responsible attitude to this issue .
( DE ) Mr President , as we know , water is the most precious of all resources , and we must not let our water drain away by choosing not to adopt an ambitious water policy .
We see how the actual concept of discrimination goes beyond its definition .
This has an especially stifling effect on investments in the grid and the introduction of new capacity .
The banks themselves must clear up after crashes and crises ; it is not up to national banks and thus taxpayers to do this .
( GA ) Mr President , I have a few words to say on the Atlantic Strategy .
In order to better define the position of third countries , on 22 March of this year the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to negotiate with non - EU countries with a view to signing agreements on their associated membership for participation in the European GNSS ( Global Navigation Satellite System ) Supervisory Authority ( GSA ) .
As a result , the next step must be the introduction of obligatory referendums for successful initiatives .
I would nevertheless like to point out that it is crucially important with this regulation , and others , that there is proper implementation and monitoring .

Opinions are divided on this , from the opinion of the Czech Office of Nuclear Safety , which shows that scanning equipment emits radiation which is harmful to human health , to that of the French Central Civil Aviation Directorate , which considers the equipment completely safe .
To address this issue , since 1994 , there has been an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament , the Commission and the Council on an accelerated working method for the adoption of codified acts .
This election will strengthen the democratic nature of our institution .
Appropriate instruments exist at European Union level .
That example should be followed and we need a framework directive to achieve that .
I would urge the Member States to take their own agreements seriously , because when major goals are set , we need to have the determination to achieve these .
The Energy Charter is a key instrument in this context .
Nevertheless , I would like to thank you for the last six months .
Thank you , Mr President .
A clear and efficient procedure whereby anyone may register a patent valid throughout the European Union will ensure that new products can reach the market more quickly , thereby boosting the rate at which businesses develop .
With regard to ROP 2000-2006 , the Campania region has accounted for the EUR 140 million funding package made available ; the money has been used to construct storage , treatment and recovery facilities , waste to energy facilities , and wet and dry separation facilities , to secure landfills , to construct , or extend , waste materials recovery facilities , and to implement separate - collection measures .
I believe that , although implementing economic policy programmes related to credit agreements means serious efforts for the Member States , at the same time , this is also an opportunity to face up to long - standing structural problems and to find solutions and answers to these within a short period , which , in the medium term , could lead to sustainable and higher growth in these countries .
By virtue of its history and cultural identity , not to mention its importance in the global economy , the European Union must act as an example and encourage aid for the Haitians and the reconstruction of one of the poorest countries on earth .
Information about this facility should be made widely known among parents and computer manufacturers should be urged to make such programs available as part of the mandatory content of new computers .
Firstly , with regard to the Roma forum : approval from our side .
Those of us in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who are in the Chamber today are more accustomed to debating agricultural matters at midnight .
All of us , and the Member States , too , have a lot of work to do in this area .
It is high time that we stopped wringing our hands and got serious .
Extremist parties exploit people 's fears of the other and of foreigners , so that they can propose an easy answer to globalisation .
Today I did not even have the opportunity to speak .
I believe that this is absolutely essential .
That is why we will not only be voting in favour of the report but we will also be giving our consent for both these countries to join the Schengen area .
Madam President , I would first of all like to welcome the fact that we finally have an opportunity to talk about the Western Sahara and to adopt a resolution .
So that will be very important work for us .
This part of the budget will finally come within the reach of Parliament , and I am looking forward to that , I can tell you .
Regard for this subject has also declined since the Red Card campaign and the World Cup .
We have three or four days at least before the majority of flights resume .
Madam President , I would like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks to my fellow Members in this House and in the delegation for the universal support I received in the negotiations , right until the end .
Therefore , we should never forget that it took two dictators to launch World War Two .
Madam President , I share your hope .
Finally , perhaps one of the positive consequences of China 's increasing presence in Africa is this debate and the report that we are going to adopt tomorrow .
We will examine these proposals carefully but , judging by what we have seen so far , I can say that our group will agree as much as possible .
This violence is being presented by China as a mere interethnic conflict between Hans and Uighurs , when it is in fact the almost inevitable result of its repressive policy in the Xinjiang region .
Belarus ( debate )

The European Union is proud of the fact that it has adopted strict terms for safeguarding public health and for protecting the environment and the welfare of animals .
I would like to comment briefly on three points .
The Danube 's development potential cannot be fully harnessed while there are still unconnected international , interregional and local transport networks , while more profound cooperation in territorial planning and strategic development planning is still lacking , and while mental barriers persist .
This motion for a resolution expresses the need to provide aid to those European regions that were recently the scene of natural disasters , such as the Autonomous Region of Madeira .
By this , we mean the design of a permanent mechanism that can provide defence in critical moments , whilst minimising moral hazard and making sure that such an instrument will only be used as a last resort in the common interest .
In response , the OSCE stated that the conduct of these elections overall was not sufficient to constitute meaningful progress in the democratic development of that country .
I would like to ask you to consider some comprehensive programmes and even tighter controls on Member States regarding childcare facilities .
I will now very briefly give my opinion on this issue .
I should like to ask the Commissioner what he intends to do about this , as it is high time we took action .
The international conference in Bali will soon show how successful we are in this respect .
( Applause )
I want to thank the Hungarian President , Mr Sólyom , who visited the village right at the beginning and listened to both parties .
I believe that the time has truly come now to lay the foundations of a true European immigration and asylum policy .
But what we have not done here is to regulate hunting .
11 .

In view of the strategic important of the project , I voted in favour of the report , although the issue of funding has not yet been fully resolved .
I think we all agree on the need for sound economic governance .
But in the face of the recurring violence , we have recycled those tired phrases so often that they have lost whatever impact they once had .
However , if nuclear power were to be chosen as a source of energy , people should first be informed about the costs , benefits and consequences of such a choice .
None .
Mr Pittella is right : a dab of powder , a touch of rouge , perhaps a little wool pulled over the eyes , but nothing more than an empty shell .
It is therefore essential for us in the EU to cut back bureaucracy across the board when drawing down from European funds .
It is no coincidence that the European Commission is tabling contemporary solutions that are capable of changing European policy as a whole .
Mr President , firstly I would just like to put the EIT in a historical context .
It is also true that there has not been equality of opportunities during the campaign , and that the ruling party has had the overwhelming support of the entire State apparatus , while the opposition has suffered constant harassment and coercion .
I would also like to say something to you , Commissioner : it is true that there are some Member States that will and others that will not be able to give this aid , and that , according to you , this will create disparity .
Lastly , I think that Baroness Ashton is right : this is a time to think big .
This assistance also ensures that these areas of instability do not jeopardise security and peace in Europe , particularly owing to the refugees and displaced people produced by such conflicts .
On Saturday , Scotland became the first country in Europe to implement a voluntary scheme of real - time closures of fishing grounds , with the aim of safeguarding cod stocks .
Clearly , we could get bogged down talking about the economic excesses of 2008 , but there have been such excesses in more countries than just little Iceland .
A coordinated European international investment policy could have an important impact on job creation not only in the EU , but also in developing countries .
We also need to revise our visa and border policies from a human rights perspective .
At the forthcoming European Council , the leaders of the Member States of the European Union should think deeply about the advisability and the consequences of consciously by - passing the will of the citizens whom they represent .
An absolute red line for Parliament is a 50 % limit for offsetting , which would ensure that the majority of our emissions reductions are domestic .

Inflation is now at around 3.6 % , even though 2 % was promised .
Use of the opt - out will not be restricted , no monitoring will be introduced , and workers will have to continue working up to 78 hours a week .
Human rights policy cannot be based on political exigencies , however , if it is to retain any credibility .
For that to happen , however , the European Union has to pay more attention to safeguarding quality , traditional and certified products , so that they can be protected internationally to avoid fraud on foreign markets involving products that have been falsely attributed to our countries .
However , what is the point of providing support and money - other than to assuage our own bad conscience - if , at the same time , we make it more difficult , by means of duties and barriers to trade , for people to recover by their own efforts .
Madam President , I would just like to make two brief comments .
There is massive infrastructure which needs to be put in place , whether it is a North Sea supergrid or , on a smaller scale , plug - in charging points for electric cars .
Why is it that the Council always thinks in intergovernmental and national terms and not in European terms ?
We remember the victims of authoritarian systems , the victims in European countries , in nationalistic and militaristic regimes , in Spain , in Portugal and in Greece .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , it is important to have an open discussion forum and cooperation between the United States of America and the European Union .
The Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) is the first to call upon them to do so .
In this sense , and in general , these agreements should be part of a broader framework that also aims to promote the rights of immigrant workers and protect them against the appalling phenomenon of exploitation .
UN agencies , the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations should have full access to these centres in line with international humanitarian law .
The next item is the vote .
Let us look at the substance of the question and we will understand that the content of the decree is absolutely fair : it is a case of targeting those who threaten law and order with their conduct , comprising public safety and harming all those who come to Italy to improve their lives by working .
You mention the importance of the Internet for economic development and the social cohesion of Europe , and even promise that the new Commission will develop a ' European Digital Agenda ' .

The candidates have had hearings before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , which has given its approval .
If such progress is made , the EU must consider extending a promise of membership to Ukraine .
The road lobby 's arguments are fallacious : as the load capacities of current HGVs are already underused , the reduction in pollutant gas emissions that people are trying to lure us with on the basis of ' fewer vehicles for more transported goods ' is a trick .
Regrettably , not all market players seem convinced already .
Why ?
The World Food Programme needs USD 7 million more this year in order to help the same number of people as last year .
However , as so many opinions have been voiced , I should like to make just a couple of important points .
Hungarians were among the greatest victims of this dictatorship .
One of the specific purposes is to promote the Nabucco project .
We have already talked about Gazprom , Chinese activity in Africa and Venezuela 's use of the funds to export the Bolivarian revolution , and we will be talking more today as a result of the financial crisis .
The 1995 decision is a decision between the Member States , reflecting the fact that consular assistance and protection is an exclusive national responsibility and that consular relations are governed mainly by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations .
Whilst I am against more red tape , we must find a system whereby drivers and their companies can be more easily prosecuted when they cause accidents in other Member States .
I think we all agree , in any case , that the best way forward is to have a transitional process , supported by the widest possible political consensus , until the elections are held .
The European benchmark , adopted by the Council in May 2009 , aims at an adequate level of basic skills in reading , mathematics and science by calling for the share of low achievers aged 15 to be reduced to below 15 % by the year 2020 .
I therefore believe it is entirely appropriate to ask the President of the House whether a common Europe is a Europe of diktats or a Europe of agreements .
The report rules out the unrestrained use of databases , as data may only be used for specific purposes , must be subject to judicial control in the Member States , and may only be processed on a case - by - case basis .
Let me also say , because this was mentioned , that the Energy Council will not overlap with the TEC .
I endorse them on behalf of the PPE - DE Group : we all support the compromises .
( NL ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by paying tribute to all those who have been working hard on this package of late , but I also support the previous speakers from my group .
Turkey will be democratised if we talk to it clearly and strictly .
It did not happen , and things will only be more difficult as a result in future .
A single heritage is a fiction , fed previously by cultural Eurocentrism ( Europe as a ' vanguard ' and other aspects mentioned ) and fed nowadays by the oft - repeated myth of a ' European ' cultural identity .
Local projects involve a large amount of work , and this contributes to the creation of large numbers of new jobs .
The CFCs and halons that have the strongest ozone - depleting effect have been completely eliminated , save for a limited number of exceptions .
The text has not yet been voted on , the compromise has not been adopted , and yet these people are suffering great economic misery , because of us .
We must not forget either the key role played by both national governments and the European Commission in drafting and effectively implementing European policies at national , regional and local level .
I would stress the need for women to be included in senior - level decision - making positions , regular consultations with civil society , and that capacity to work on gender issues within missions be enhanced .
The main amendments proposed by Parliament and reintroduced in the report , which I voted for , relate to issues that I believe to be of the utmost importance for the European market .
Theme - by - theme specificity , which is real and does not mean business as usual , must be defendable vis - à - vis the system or the European Court .
If we are going to be serious about authorisation and correcting the authorisation process to make it more effective and safer , we must tackle this flagrant abuse of the process .
The main criterion , less than 10 % refused visas , is a criterion depending exclusively on American citizens and not on citizens requesting visas .
We also need micro - supervision and , in my opinion , the Commission proposal represents the lowest common denominator , the minimum .
The downward trend in the sector is also partly due to the volume of imports from third countries .
As specifically concerns the situation regarding the care of dependants , the Commission has already put the following actions on the table .
The Szczeczin shipyard is the fifth largest in Europe and is experiencing serious difficulties , as is the shipyard in Gdynia .
The health strategy that we adopted today in the Commission will be sent to Parliament to be discussed with you as well .

This will show to what extent the core of the cohesion policy stands to meet the challenge of new circumstances .
More than two thirds of the Austrian population - although they are not alone - are of the opinion that we can manage the crisis with the assistance of the European Union only - and that means together .
Because the companies were not supplying the goods and services that consumers wanted to buy , we are now throwing aside rules on state aid and keeping up companies that may not survive in the long term .

I voted for this report and would like to thank the rapporteur for the job she has done and for the suggestions .
Foreign policy is a serious matter : it needs strategies , firm objectives and clear alliances .
Above all , therefore , we need the political determination to take action to save many human lives , to stop this silent slaughter of innocent children whose only crime is to have been born in a poor country .
Without those commitments , we are heading for a climatic , political and moral disaster .
The terrorist attacks in the US showed that even third countries with sophisticated infrastructure can find it difficult to cope under extreme circumstances .
Instead it is free movement which takes precedence over it .
The ranks of the poor are increasingly being swollen by people who do have jobs .
I am not persuaded by the financial arguments which emphasise the high costs of introducing the directive in relation to disabled people .
The negotiations with the Council have led to solutions that can be accepted without reservation , especially in sensitive fields such as the protection of vulnerable people and unaccompanied minors , the conditioning of repatriation to the countries of origin or countries where the European Union has concluded bilateral agreements in this field .
Another subject that was addressed in this long discussion was easier access to standards .
It is therefore very pleasing that we have succeeded in improving our own environmental protection data , one example being a 12.9 % drop in CO 2 emissions in 2008 .
Of course , it can cite Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement to strengthen the dialogue with the political authorities of that country .
The same applies to minority ethnic groups .
I would like to mention three key factors .
It is only here and in ' Sarkozia ' that it can be said that the Treaty of Lisbon is fundamentally different from the European Constitution , when the vast majority of EU heads of state and government and the father of the Constitution itself , Valéry Giscard d'Estaing , state the exact opposite .
I am quite sure , however , that when these changes are transposed , some compromise solutions will need to be evaluated , and it will be essential to carry out any resulting adjustments so long as they are considered feasible in terms of the convention itself .
It has also improved water governance and management in ACP countries .
More efficient energy use is the key to unlocking massive environmental and economic benefits - and reducing Europe 's annual energy bill by around EUR 200 billion .
This Directive represents major progress .
I cannot fail to notice that the most recent surveys show Croatians to be suspicious of their country 's future entry into the Union and critical of the EU 's actions .
I find it appropriate to support the Council 's position in favour of the Interim Partnership Agreement , because I consider guaranteeing supplies of resources a priority , especially in view of their scarcity and environmental degradation .
Next year Europe will be united as it has never been before .
And yet Europe is filled with millions of Muslims who have come here from all sorts of backgrounds and causations ; just as Europe would still be filled with Jews , had it not been for the horrors of the Second World War .
We cannot afford to wait until 2012 for this to come into force .
On energy efficiency and promotion of renewables , the Commission fully shares the concerns of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , but we believe that the Internal Market Directive is not the best place to discuss this subject .
In this sense , giving a financial dimension to the Europe 2020 strategy brings into play and gives a central role to our consistency and credibility .
I think that this is worrying .
( FI ) Mr President , Iran would have an important role in the Middle East peace negotiations but , to our regret , the country seems to be slipping ever further away from the democratic rule of law .
The Commission 's document refers to the alleged need to develop further legal immigration policies to alleviate the perils of demographic ageing .

All of us in politics and in society must take that path .
I look forward to getting to the point where I can have a real conversation with you in much better German than I can do today .

Thus , in order to support Moldova 's economic recovery and provide a positive perspective for people working in the wine industry in the country ( one quarter of the workforce ) , there is a proposed increase in the duty free tariff quota for wine , from 100 000 hl to 150 000 hl for 2011 , from 120 000 hl to 180 000 hl for 2012 , and from 2013 onwards to 240 000 hl per year .

Emergency measures therefore need to be adopted that give an immediate and suitable response to the sector 's socio - economic needs , such as the creation of a guarantee fund , paid for at Union level , that ensures the stability of fuel prices and the use of all financial possibilities and margins of the EU budget to finance extraordinary support measures for the sector .
Mr Füle , the question of the return of the refugees , if you will pardon my saying so , has been handled by Croatia in a way which could serve as a model for other states .

In the first draft , which created the post of the President of the Council , there was a proposal that this Council President should be a prime minister who had been in office for at least two and a half years ( as a joke , Mr Reinfeldt , we called it the ' Bruton clause ' , after John Bruton , because John told us that he had been prime minister for two years and seven months , and therefore would be eligible for the post ) .
I have personally met the staff who are responsible for SOLVIT in the Czech Republic .
These meetings review the epidemiological situation , discuss and decide on measures and on appropriate legislative acts .

Why ?
Mr President , finally , I think it is an internal , Italian matter .

Therefore , the European Union should be fighting not for the right to wear the burkha but for the right to work without wearing it .
A great deal certainly remains to be done there with regard to the structural funds in particular .
( LT ) It is symbolic that 20 years after the fall of the wall that divided Europe , today we are talking about Europe 2020 .
Finally , we wish to say that we feel that funds for these technologies ought to be part of the debate on future financing of EU policies , and therefore the Member States should be required to make a greater effort , at least in the same proportion as they did in response to the energy crisis during the 1980s .

This is the way forward for Europe and it is fortunately also an important point of consensus between the Commission , the Council and the European Parliament .
This makes Europe a stronger partner at a global level .
Firstly , there is the important role played by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development in modernising villages .
The armed conflict is accompanied by a humanitarian catastrophe : there is not enough food for refugees , there are sudden increases in the price of food , barely 20 % of children attend school , children are forced into the armed forces , and violence against children is becoming increasingly widespread , especially sexually - motivated attacks on girls .

Please recognise paragraph 9 of our resolution , which talks about the inclusion of the human rights clause in the PCA agreement .
All of us as Members , in these last days of this mandate , are spending our time tearing around , going from trialogue to trialogue and first - reading agreement to first - reading agreement , arguing about sets of words , the contents of sentences in legislation .
Without them , we all lose out on their knowledge , experience and ideas .
What is in this text ?

Mrs Berès is absolutely right : what this is really about is finally creating a real internal market in the investment funds sector .
I am conscious that our interpreters have been here for a long time .
Madam President , tomorrow 's vote on Passenger Name Records would not have been necessary had we here in Parliament been taken more seriously and kept better informed by the Commission and the Council on the subject of the forwarding of data by the EU and its Member States to third countries since the SWIFT decision .
Many industrial companies would have to relocate to third countries with less climate protection , which will raise prices and slow down Romania 's development project on infrastructure .
( RO ) The G 20 leaders established in Pittsburgh in September 2009 that the main priority in the economic recovery plans must be to preserve existing jobs and create new ones .
In the case of older women or women who are physically or mentally weaker , the problem of self - defence and the protection of their own interests is even more complicated .
I am grateful to the Commissioner for the information that she has provided us with , but we would like to obtain more detailed information on what point each Member State has actually reached .
In return , we , in our countries , keep cracking down on short - stay visa holders , and a vicious circle emerges .

In order for the 2020 targets to be achieved , we must create an EU - wide effective incentive system , supporting businesses and individuals that use or introduce renewable energy resources .
( PL ) Madam President , the fact that EU citizens have to migrate in order to find work , the fact that they have to be mobile because there is no work to be found where they live , and the poverty associated with being out of work , often mean that children are less well cared for , and sometimes even neglected .
With regard to the payments , only 9.62 % of the EUR 347 billion for regional policy has been paid to the project leaders .
Over the last two years Croatia has made laudable progress in most of the areas covered by Community law .
This is ongoing ; but in railways , things take time and investments are large and 85 % of the TEN - T Network money is used especially to improve the railways , including the ERTMS .
Furthermore I believe the estimate of a EUR 100 million transfer for youth projects is important , since Parliament identified this policy as one of its priorities for 2011 , and these funds will be helpful in financing mobility , education , and employment projects for all the young people of Europe .

I would say that these three factors are fundamental : firstly , the person authorising the act must have the status of a public official ; secondly , the act is constitutive in nature and does not merely certify a signature ; and thirdly , it must not produce effects other than those it would produce in its country of origin .
Our main debate today concerns scientific data on climate change .

Particularly in the case of Côte d'Ivoire , there was concern over the fact that , actually , there was not really a stable government in the country , and there were concerns over whether you could make a deal with a country in that position .
( IT ) Mr President , I voted in favour of the report by Mr Garriga Polledo on the forthcoming financial perspectives of the Union because , at one of the greatest times of crisis for the so - called European spirit , I am convinced that it is vital for us to insist upon and prevail in our belief that it is essential to provide the Union with credible instruments , beginning with adequate funding .
This is beneficial at all levels : private costs in addition to national costs .
These are the practical challenges to which we want to respond .
Therefore , this is not primarily a problem of adapting national law .
Opening of the sitting
I think it will be a very useful precedential document for us to study , because it seems to me that he robustly supports the scientific justification for the use of GM crops in Europe where they are scientifically approved and authorised .
Due to all these reasons , it is stressed that the EU requires a more effective approach to migration , which would complement foreign policy instruments .
Yet indirectly , we are encouraging oil exploitation in the most vulnerable and fragile part of our globe , where the consequences could be horrific .
When we are discussing the costs of regulations , we must also concern ourselves with the compliance costs , which are ignored at the moment .
We have a duty to heal Europe 's public finances and we have a duty to set out responses , which have to begin with the involvement of businesses and the world of work , and have different and more open rules in order to complete the single market and be in a better position to compete on the global market .

Yes , we should all like to meet energy demands exclusively by means of renewable sources .
Only after ratification will the EU be able to say whether the condition it imposed regarding comparable reduction efforts has been implemented .
I hope that the Commission will find time to examine this problem more closely in the overall context of the European economic stimulus plan .

I would like to note that questions concerning the protection of minority rights are also dealt with by the Council of Europe under its framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities .
Any state with the death penalty should ensure proper procedures of evidence collection , prisoner interrogation and fair trials .
My fellow Members have avoided mentioning that explicitly : the requesting of DNA data , the requesting of fingerprints , the requesting of data on criminal convictions - and all via the system that we created with the Prüm Convention .
Take , for example , Guinea - Bissau , where more than 50 % of children are not registered .
The Council was divided , but had the benefit of unanimity and blocked conciliation .
Please come to grips with this subject as well .
The new countries are being phased in and the margin in the agriculture budget is steadily becoming smaller .
However , the work that we are doing aside , it is our wish , at European level , that - through you , at the Commission , in particular - the Member States assume their share of the responsibility .
It was only thanks to our will to achieve a good result , while of course retaining full respect for Community law , and our will to develop an instrument which will fit into the legal system of the EU , and thanks to our desire to work well together , that we could reach the stage at which we are closing the debate today , which will probably lead to our achieving success at first reading .

' Calls for the presentation of a resolution , at the next UN General Assembly , with a request to all countries who retain the death penalty to make available to the UN Secretary - General and to public opinion all information on capital punishment and executions , so as to overcome the state secret on the death penalty , which is also a direct cause of a greater number of executions ' .

That is why I appeal to you today .
Social networks have seen a scale of expansion which was not envisaged a few years ago .
If you achieve this , may God reward you , and if not , may He hold you to account .
However , I do believe that all of this is based on a misunderstanding , which can be cleared up .
Creativity and capacity for innovation are linked competences which need to be fostered as widely as possible through lifelong learning .
What is important is that , when we provide aid , we should emphasise the fact that we are doing this now because the European Union recognises that the threat posed by climate change is a challenge to our civilisation as well as being civilisation 's responsibility .
Men have been held in detention for almost ten years on this part of Cuban territory for the sole purpose of bypassing US legal jurisdiction and in spite of the lack of evidence against some of them .
This is why the fifth cohesion report is so timely .
( FR ) Madam President , I wish to say that Mr Posselt 's question is pertinent .
Mr President , I am not Italian , I am not Brazilian , I am a citizen of a Member State of the European Union , and I do not want the Union to be a Union which has lost its sense of proportion - a Union in which a criminal enjoys the same rights as the victims of crimes and their families .
( HU ) Multilingualism and intercultural dialogue does not preclude the possibility for those who belong to the same culture and speak the same language to meet and create international organisations and consultative bodies .
The vote on the resolution will take place tomorrow ( Thursday 15 January 2009 ) .
There are good reasons why policy has grown in such an organic way , but it seems like a good time to take stock and to move on and , for that ongoing work on the review , I see three lines of action .
We request additional funding for the SOLVIT network that , despite the justified expectation , has not reached the estimated efficiency in solving the legal problems citizens are dealing with on the internal market .
The Commission now has a new resource ; it has a new set of instruments at its disposal which , as I have said , are essentially and fundamentally in the hands of the Member States .
This brings a confused debate to the fore that has been developing over the ways and possibility of integrating and assimilating the new immigrants flooding into the continent .
However , I agree with the rapporteur that there is a very fine dividing line and , among other things , there is the risk that the funds will be used only to make agriculture more competitive , to the detriment of other sectors in rural areas .
This special report by the Ombudsman follows a complaint submitted about the Commission 's refusal to disclose three letters sent by Porsche AG to the Commissioner , Mr Verheugen , and the Commission 's subsequent six extensions of the deadline for submitting its detailed opinion on the Ombudsman 's draft recommendation .
in writing . - There is not much to say on this report that is not self explanatory .
Paragraph 3 states that ' in order to be operational , a VAT system based on the " origin principle " requires tax approximation between countries to avoid tax competition ' .
The Council is fully aware of all of these challenges and has adopted the recommendations of the social protection committee concerning views on demographic change in Europe and the challenges this poses .
Although not a Member State of the European Economic Area , Switzerland has continued to show interest in cooperating more closely with the Union in the field of education , training and youth .
The European Commission gave us a text that contained a great deal of food for thought , which we have tried to build on and supplement .
Mr President , I therefore believe that the time has come to join forces , for us to realise that the world is not waiting for us , the Europeans , and that either we Europeans must unite and maintain constructive positions regarding the problems that our citizens are experiencing at the moment , or else Europe , as a power , will disappear from the map .
I think it is time the Palestinian side , too , made clear that it wants peace .
The question of migratory movements has a security dimension , but it also has a human dimension that should not be ignored .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , once again I want to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and Mr Goepel in particular for their hard work , resulting in an excellent report .
A strong precedent may be established for other FTAs waiting in line and coming up soon in the near future .
Although no one can argue against the need for such a guaranteed minimum income scheme , it may obviously be open to abuse .
Of particular concern are grievances voiced regarding freedom of the media and freedom of assembly and of association .
Mr President , from what the previous speakers have said , it is clear that we are all pleased that it will be possible to implement the 2011 EU budget efficiently and without unnecessary delays as of 1 January next year .
Honourable Members , you will not be surprised that there are some amendments that the Commission , after careful reflection , cannot support .
- ( PL ) Mr President , Slovenia is the first of the new Member States to take on the Presidency of the European Union .
( FR ) Mr President , I have no wish to take the floor on behalf of the Presidency , but I would like to respond to my fellow Member Mr Pomés Ruiz .
This proposal for a regulation contributes to establishing a European energy policy that aims at efficiency , reliability and security .
Mr President , I too welcome the new President - in - Office and wish him well for the next six months .
There is a need for increased EU support for domestic war crimes investigations and trials and for the Copenhagen criteria to include even more support for a well - trained and high - performing judiciary , but the legacy of this is that the Tribunal must also contribute to reconciliation and inter - ethnic understanding , and the work of NGOs deserves more resources .
I call on the European Union 's High Representative to support the efforts to hold free elections in Zimbabwe , devoid of violence and intimidation .
Madam President , I , too , would like to thank the High Representative for her words , which struck the necessary note of optimism .
The first issue concerns public confidence in the justice system , which seems extremely important to me , at a time when our democracies , the democracies of the Member States , cannot be envisaged without this confidence in the justice system .
The resolution does not respect UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99 and even calls on the five Member States of the EU , including Greece , which have not recognised the unilateral independence of Kosovo to do so ; in other words , to violate the UN resolution .
The European Central Bank already has EUR 360 billion in financial instruments on its books that are not freely tradable and holds a further EUR 480 billion in poorly secured securities .
For a long time , the Member States have negotiated with the United States on an individual basis and concluded bilateral agreements .
The existence of a ' pseudo - state ' under ' supervised sovereignty ' , protected by the EU / NATO , specifically by means of their ' EULEX ' and ' viceroys ' , the ' International Civilian Representative ' and the ' EU Special Representative ' , who have judicial , police and customs powers , as well as ' executive functions ' and monitoring functions , constitute unacceptable acts of neo - colonialism .
I also know that we should step up our support for civil society and for people - to - people contacts .
In an earlier debate , I complained about the fact that the Council is not present .
Such solutions were successful , for example , in the case of standards for compact discs - they can be used in all computers .
Failure to do this would lead to the loss of a rich cultural heritage .
It is up to the European Parliament to send a signal to Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania tomorrow .
Because the couple are under house arrest they used a webcam link to take part in a hearing of the European Parliament on the human rights situation in China .
I would also ask that in the framework of the Bonn Convention you establish criteria for biofuels but also demand and obtain agreement on the creation of a group of intergovernmental experts on biodiversity , like the IPCC for climate change , because we could help others to put in place tools that we ourselves are introducing but they have not yet introduced .
It invites all the parties concerned to mobilise their efforts to bring it to an end .
It is true that this may be voluntary and that it may be used as an additional tool - as already happens - in suspected cases of drug trafficking , where something is hidden in the body , but not as a replacement for a totally reasonable check which can be very useful and is accepted by everyone .
Lastly , to conclude , there are a few timetabling issues : we also have economic governance , the winding - up of the Council 's task force , and the Commission 's proposals ; a great deal of work will be required to link up this budget with future budgets and the financial perspective .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting
In this context , this report takes as its background the negotiations that took place 20 years ago to reach a free trade agreement between the EU and the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) , making these the oldest trade negotiations initiated by the EU , but which have not been concluded to this day .
Around one million Moldovans work and live abroad in the west , especially in Italy , Portugal and Austria .
We already have our policy for right now , 2010 , in the European Union , so this is a strategy looking forward .
Under Article 19 , European members of the UNSC do not explicitly present EU positions in the Council .
And yet , within hours , there were a number of sites , across the Internet , glorifying those hideous murders and praising those who had carried them out .
Of course if you wish I can supply precise and detailed information on previous examples .
I support the request submitted to the Commission for creating a public ecodesign database available online .
Secondly , I would like to stress the need to promote instruments for monitoring , reporting and verifying , in particular , those of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security ( GMES ) range of services , of the satellites that will provide absolutely vital data in this area .
The people of the FYROM do not deserve to be ostracised in any way .
The use of ICT may help older people to become more independent and to remain healthy , and may enhance their quality of life .
These studies have been on the table since the middle of this year .
At the same time , we emphasised the problem of non - tariff barriers , which prevent European businesses from accessing Japanese public contracts .
As Mrs Castex has already said , that simply is not the case .
In the area of translations alone , we can save around EUR 11 million annually .
However , it highlights failings in procurement procedures , particularly with regard to the under - estimation of the budgets of framework contracts , which ultimately constitutes an obstacle to fair competition .
We have now had many meetings with the Commission to get reassurance on this .
I would appeal to the French and Czech Council Presidencies to take Parliament 's ball and to pass it back .
I must fully acknowledge that the general competence in health policy and financing of health policy remains , and will continue to remain , at Member State level .
Although we agree upon the need to provide the funds as quickly as possible , we regret that the proposal presented by the European Commission implies , among other budget headings , a reduction in funding for important community programmes compared with the previous and current multiannual financial framework .
Everyone agrees that we have to respect all of the international and environmental conventions , certainly when it comes to the sensitive Baltic Sea area .
The world is short of food .
Even though I often express dissatisfaction in the tiers here in Parliament , and when I now look back and see that the tiers of opponents are empty and that the vast majority of opponents are not taking part in this debate , I wish to make it quite clear that of course we are also critical of the institutions and we want improvements .
President - in - Office of the Council . - Mr President , the Presidency , building on the work carried out by the French Presidency , is pursuing actively discussions on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of patients ' rights in cross - border health care .
We had a very rewarding debate on this during Parliament 's plenary sitting in September .
Please allow me to join the homage to him by his comrades - in - arms in the presence of the most senior national and European authorities , especially our High Representative , Javier Solana , and our colleague Karl von Wogau .
Have you not listened to the people infuriated at how anti - terror laws are being exploited for commercial gain ?
The report on certification of train drivers can be seen , in some respects , as a report on interoperability .
I hope we have all learned the lesson that protectionism only makes recovery harder .
I believe that is the right approach .
If we compare the position of the states neighbouring the EU , then we see that - after Russia - the most important partner is Ukraine .
For the sake of consistency , why does Greece not therefore also insist on calling Estonia the ' Former Soviet Republic of Estonia ' as a formal title ?
If we only do it when the media 's attention is on those countries or on us , then we will fail .
- Mayer report
I express my full support for the report by Mr Coelho .
Let us not make this more of a political issue than is necessary , however .
( EL ) Madam President , Mr López Garrido , I want to link the question of financial supervision by the European Union to speculative action by mutual funds , including funds domiciled in the European Union , in the City of London .
Although the question of whether or not to include self - employed drivers in the scope of the Directive is a genuine dilemma , let me say that it is also a false problem .
Madam President , Mrs Malmström , Commissioner , the fact that Mr Obama and the new majority in Congress are presenting us with a significant opportunity to intensify our cooperation , in particular , with regard to the common transatlantic market , has already been mentioned .
In some cases we are cutting back the civil defence which saves us from fires .
It is good that we periodically review and modify provisions in these areas .
But only a united EU can turn what is now perceived as a threat into an opportunity and a step forward in relations with Russia .
That is what I usually call ' secular ethics ' and it is the basis of our happy life , our inner peace .
We shall do what we can in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs to contribute to the achievement of that aim .
One of the signs of this is the very low turnout for elections to the European Parliament , arising from the widely - held feeling that citizens cannot influence events in the EU through their vote in any way whatsoever .
A responsible constitutional court would necessarily describe such a law as unconstitutional .
I therefore consider that this proposal warrants not only Council 's attention but acceptance by Council .
With the current Directive on the Sustainable Use of Plant Protection Products we are taking a giant step towards more commonality in European environmental and consumer protection .
Another key issue is improving energy efficiency .
I believe that frank sex education for children is relevant to the prevention of sexual abuse of children , but it should also be addressed at parents , educators and social and health professionals .
We must , of course , stress that increased capitalisation of the banks is a necessary precondition for making the financial sector more stable and strong , but it will not be enough .
Madam President : I am very pleased that I and my group have persevered in fighting the left 's evil obsession with confiscatory taxation .
The agricultural sector does indeed need to be financed in order to safeguard the sustainability of the sector and food security in Europe .
It will make life more complicated for wine - growers and for the entire wine industry .
Mr Brock , in particular , got it right when he said that there is a mystery in our relationship with things that makes us realise that we have not mastered everything , that however advanced we may be , we have not got the answer to all problems that nature poses to humans and the magnitude of this earthquake reminds us of exactly that .
( DE ) Mr President - in - Office , Mr President of the Commission , Mr President of Parliament , I agree with Mr Karas on one point , namely that it is not about the number of times that the word ' social ' is mentioned but the spirit of the text itself .
In the exercise of its right of scrutiny under the Comitology procedure , Parliament has raised a number of problems and objections regarding the way the Commission implemented the instrument , and the interpretation it gave to some of its core provisions .
However , we accept the scope of the regulation as presented to us , which covers international , not cross - border , services , with the possibility of picking up and setting down passengers between stations within every Member State .
There has been more and more populism and nationalism , there is too much political entrenchment , and verbal attacks are being levelled at neighbouring countries .
Air agreements now fall within this category .
I urge this House to support the work of the CMP , and to support Written Declaration 10 which is humanitarian in its objectives and seeks to bring peace and remembrance and reconciliation to these families .
Madam President , conditions are far more favourable for embarking on a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Tajikistan than , for example , Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan , these latter countries being total dictatorships .
I wish to congratulate President Barroso on taking the initiative in 2005 to inaugurate this dialogue with religious leaders ; I also wish to congratulate the Presidents of Parliament and of the Council for maintaining this dialogue on an annual basis .
We must ask the people to decide , by ' yes ' or ' no ' , on principles and fundamentals , not on sophisticated technicalities and complicated compromises .
I apologise for this procedure , but the dramatic events in Libya have caused us to consider it important to add a few words .
We have decided to extend this right to petitions , too .
The new emissions standards for heavy - duty vehicles relate to a reduction in pollutants , not in greenhouse gases : the two are sometimes confused .
As you well know , in an important cultural shift , we have decided to complement a traditional ground - based approach with new tools .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , I should like to address some remarks to Prime Minister Janša .
There is no excuse for what was done to Georgia .
It is the Council 's interpretation that decisions of that nature do require unanimity .
It is also an opportunity for us to see how we can support democratic responses to the structural problems inherent in social cohesion .
I also think that there is room for the proposal made by the second speaker within these directives , which you will be able to debate in this Chamber , for example , in relation to the regulation of hedge funds , which is within the supervision requirements which have been discussed , or something which the current President of the Council of the Union mentioned here this morning , the eradication of tax havens .
The problems of transparency in the European Union are concentrated mainly on convergence and harmonisation of the law in Member States .
( SL ) Madam President , I am pleased to have been given the floor before Mr Goerens , my colleague from Luxemburg , because otherwise that would have undermined the basic point that I am going to make , that we who have been speaking here for the past half hour have been mainly members from South - Eastern Europe .
Firstly , we must target the poorest countries in our cooperation programmes .
I should stress that the European Union will continue steadfastly to support Georgia in its efforts to find a peaceful settlement of the unresolved conflicts both in Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Integrated planning clearly allows for the Structural Funds to be used in a way that will further Europe 's cohesion policy objectives .
Parallel measures such as a tax on air fuel and charges on nitrogen oxide emissions , NOx , are a must , and this is precisely what we are calling for in this report .
( FR ) Mr President , my question is very simple .
Here in the European Parliament today , we are celebrating one of the most important and historic decisions that the European Union has taken so far .
So , while we may be proud of this text , we have less to shout about with regard to the timetable : it is not really good enough , in my opinion , to introduce passengers ' rights over a possible 15 - year timescale if our aim - and it is our aim today - is to develop rail travel .
In this case , expulsion shall be based on objective elements and a ban on re - entry cannot be imposed .
On average , each EU citizen produces 25 kg of electronic waste every year .
I will just make three remarks .
What is important now is seriously to consider whether we need to review the legal framework .
It is not a coincidence that one of the innovation partnerships mentioned by the Commission is precisely about raw materials , researching ways to recycle and replace raw materials .
Instead , we want to remind everyone of how important it is that these hearings cannot be selective in any sense and that the legal proceedings must be open and must be non - discriminatory .
A solution should have been found by now .
She knows very well that the Commission supported her proposals .
5 .
This includes measures designed to discourage and prevent fraud and theft of personal data .
Faced with a choice between democracy and supra - nationalism , the European Union almost always opts for supra - nationalism and nowhere is this clearer than in its policy in the Western Balkans .
This is a step in the right direction and a sensible response to those economic challenges .
Just as in Poland , where totalitarianism did not fall because of words , but because of deeds , so European solidarity will be effective if it is translated into specific action .
I believe that this will provide another show of support and an original guarantee of the high quality of our products .
The Commission proposal has been submitted to the Council .
In the area of international and trade relations , Russia also needs a partner that is more stable and reliable than China or Iran .
International relations can indeed provide a great deal of help here .
To this end , we also need rules and regulations .
I think that the citizens of Europe deserve better than that .
on behalf of the PPE - DE Group . - Mr President , can I first of all welcome the new Commissioner to his post .
The objective of this report was precisely to eliminate that contradiction , and now we can harmonise the Member States ' legislation that pertain to standards of animal welfare in slaughtering or killing .
The political elites of four or five countries in the latest 2004 enlargement have not , in my view , either understood or taken on board European policy or the Community acquis .
Mr President , as you can see , I had two minutes left .
The agreement between the Islamic north and the non - Islamic south , reached after a long internal war , is under pressure .
( DE ) Mr President , I would ask Members to take note of what this item on the agenda is actually about .
( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we should highlight the fact that , in the light of the continuing structural crisis in our Member States , the European Parliament is taking a cautious approach to its budgetary plans for 2012 .
Here we also need to act in the international dimension to be most effective .
The recent appointment of coordinators for projects encountering technical , political or financial difficulties is a step in the right direction .
What we have not seen , and what we should see , given that the accounts have been very biased , is what happened in Ossetia .
Lastly , our group calls upon the Council to make swift progress on the economic governance package and to take proper account of the European Parliament 's position as co - legislator on four out of the six proposals under discussion .
Restrictive measures affecting the rights of individuals following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty ( debate )
I want to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Neves , on her hard work in bringing together different positions into a consistent document .
This is a very real risk I can envisage .
On the other hand , it is also clear to me that we are talking about the Interim Agreement today .
Well , new technology brings new challenges : considerable economic challenges .
However , we are continuing with the same policy in Portugal and in Greece again , rather than admit our mistake .
Many of us believe that this is not the way forward , but you have taken the decision to subordinate your own country to something that must be considered jointly .
in writing . - ( SV ) We can see that desperate attempts are being made to build a European nation with its own national identity .
In this case , the Commission proposed to mobilise the Solidarity Fund to provide EUR 31 255 790 for Portugal and EUR 35 635 750 for France , making a total of EUR 66 891 540 .
This is also the basis for the proposals in the report .
In East Germany , there was no data protection , no democracy and there were no fundamental rights for citizens - three important factors that are fundamental to our cooperation .
On the other hand , however , the Commission must be given the task of examining the conditions required to make such measures possible in the first place .
We are now within sight of the finishing line .
The aim of this draft recommendation is to help Member States deal with rare diseases more effectively , more efficiently and more globally .
The delegation will be mandated to voice Parliament 's concerns on the HRC 's work and will report to the Subcommittee on Human Rights during its visit .
I am very sorry for that because the Lisbon Treaty deserves visible protest .
In 2000 the EU had 450 000 tonnes of olive oil in storage , and the EU decided to run advertising campaigns in the northern countries to inform us how good and beneficial olive oil was .
Europe definitely needs a common approach to immigration in the EU .
I will say nothing more than that in respect of the yellow - bellies on my right , but they certainly are disingenuous at best !
The next item on the agenda is the debate on six motions for a resolution concerning Belarus .
Since the present structure of the European Union is vastly different from what it was in 1957 , we have to adopt a new European document ; we need clear new rules .
The June List believes that it is very important for Member States in the European area to be in a good economic position and is in favour of an independent European neighbourhood policy .
Only in that way we can stop the distribution of counterfeit products and eradicate the black market in medicines .
This is quite simply going too far if we ever want to be taken seriously as a legislative assembly .
( DE ) Mr President , the economy , the environment and people - these are the three cornerstones within which we must fit European law relating to road charging and the Eurovignette .
Do you have any comment on this ?
I should like to ask the Commission how it intends to follow up on scientific research efforts in this area , to intensify these efforts , and to translate the results of this research into benefits for Europeans in the light of the Europe 2020 strategy .
The first is cabotage and the date that the European Parliament deemed right to set , in other words automatic liberalisation in 2014 .
As is customary with European Union legislation , the Commission was asked , after a certain time , to submit a report on the application and implementation of the Statute in order to draw conclusions about whether there is a need for amendments to this legal act .
Energy market integrity and transparency (
It had a rather difficult start , having been formally launched in the 80s and undergoing its first reform in 2002 .
As an example of action at European level , we will develop a more integrated European standardisation system as an important platform for sharpening the competitive edge of our companies , particularly SMEs .
At the same time , Member States might be imposing congestion charges in large cities on hard - pressed motorists who have no choice .
The directive is indispensable in order that victims of violence can feel comparatively safe throughout the European Union , regardless of where they are living .
Sport is an effective means by which to promote social integration and mutual understanding at national and international level .
We are still not allowing enough children with special education needs into the schools , so we are still missing out on 15 % .
Yet I feel that the compromise has also resolved that aspect well because , as has been said , for the first time the scope of the two directives , in Article 1 , includes the recognition of fundamental rights and freedoms as well as Internet access .
But meanwhile , important changes have occurred .
It was a present for the big sugar concerns , which moved their production out of Europe , and today we import sugar from them .
The EU now needs to consider a substantial reinforcement of targeted measures against Rajoelina and his henchmen and cronies and , if necessary , to invoke the Cotonou Agreement 's provisions on failures of governance and to apply the necessary sanctions .
The current financial and economic crisis poses massive challenges for the automotive and supply industry .
It is particularly concerning that in many states , funds from industrial nations have been used to keep dictators or ruling classes in power and to suppress the poor masses .
So we will have to mobilise .
Big business is exerting pressure for greater and faster reform of the CAP and for it to be adapted to the rules of the WTO , so that the multinationals can garner even more land , consolidate their sovereignty in the production and marketing of food and strengthen their position in international competition .
It is not the Commission 's money ; it is not MEPs ' money .
During the process of awarding contracts for the Galileo deployment phase , the Commission has strictly applied the principle of reciprocity and we hope that this has given a boost to the negotiations with third countries on the mutual opening up of markets .
It also requires support to help rebuild its national institutions and civil society .
Please put it to the vote again so that people can make the right decision .
Politicians in the EU should create sustainable and beneficial frameworks for society and companies rather than involving themselves in controlling every detail .
The rapporteur 's proposal is that the names of those with parental responsibility should be printed in the child 's passport .
Secondly , it will dedicate special attention to energy efficiency , renewable sources of energy , biofuels , to carbon dioxide capture and storage and generally a transition to a low carbon economy .
The implementation of the European semester , the adoption of the permanent stability mechanism , along with the commitments made before Parliament , including the legislative package , which will have to be balanced by Parliament , are all steps in the right direction .
Those in the South want to have a more institutionally defined framework for economic integration .
in writing . - While we recognise that Cuba is a Communist tyranny and while we want to see Cuba transformed to a peaceful democratic state , we do not recognise the EU in this process .
Therefore , we must not forget these deeply human starting points when we consider the economic and social future of our Union , that is to say our strategy for growth and employment .
It is obvious however that the 2001 European legislation governing this right of access needs to be brought up to date .
On the contrary , this Commission , and I am sure also this Parliament , should be active - and we could be even more active together - in promoting a European citizens ' agenda .
The aim is to have a full - scale roll - out of eCall by 2010 .
I always speak as I find , even when my opinions run counter to those who spoke before me .
With such a small budget , it will be difficult to put into effect the priorities drafted by both the European Commission and Parliament , especially as these priorities are distinctly increasing with each year that goes by .
Unfortunately , he missed the opportunity .
Last but not least , apiculture products are used not only for food consumption , but also become ingredients in products .
I am thinking , for example , of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights .
We recognised then the need to act more broadly to introduce a horizontal directive to combat all forms of discrimination throughout the whole of society .
However , I believe that the amendments tabled by the rapporteur are important .
Secondly , I would like to make access to public contracts easier , especially in terms of cross - border participation by small and medium - sized enterprises .
It is difficult , however , to believe that democracy could be strengthened in Belarus merely through EU coercion .
I know how important this is for the ordinary citizens of the Western Balkans .
Opening of the sitting
Today 's vote will enable European agricultural tractor manufacturers to deal with the more stringent exhaust emission limits imposed by the entry into force of Stage III B of Directive 2000/25 / EC .
You know that 2007 is a year to be forgotten as quickly as possible because certain countries did not honour their commitments , which eclipsed the good behaviour of others who , for their part , showed they were able to do so .
Unfortunately , we have not , and that is why this debate is not about figures , this debate is about ethics and politics , it is a debate that qualifies or disqualifies us in the eyes of those who call us to account .
Today the industry is asking the Commission to accept another exemption from the 2006 REACH regulation , already granted for a limited period , for chrysotile asbestos fibres .
I feel that the sum of EUR 100 million is not sufficient to achieve the objectives being proposed .
Their crime was that they were young homosexuals who dared to love one another .
The structural dialogue we introduced this year , the intense communication between the committees and the Commissioners really paid off .
Nowadays , Member States are facing economic , financial and social crises , creating the need more than ever for solidarity and respect for the Union 's basic principles .
That is why our cooperation should be closely linked to improvements in the fields of human rights and the rule of law .
This means , in fact , that there would be EUR 22 million in the combined reserve on staff salaries , and I really hope that Parliament will be able to reconsider its position on this in the plenary session .
For that reason , barriers that are still in place need to be removed and procedures simplified , while existing programmes need to be expanded and promoted .
They have a high priority , not only somewhere like the Arctic , but in other areas of the globe as well .
However , there is no room for complacency .
It is a step in the right direction .
This is not expressed sufficiently in the resolution , which is why I did not vote in favour .
It is right that you should work together with the Council .
Therefore , they must continue to use their local currency , and this is giving rise to harmful , devastating consequences at present .
The new bilateral agreement with Morocco preserves the interests of the European producers by maintaining the system of monthly tariff quotas of tomatoes and strict control of the quantities imported .
I think this is progress .
However , Conservatives do not support the concept of an EU Discrimination Directive .
( Applause )
Obviously the Commission has a major role to play in the application of European law as the guarantor of application of the Treaties , but it must do this in conjunction with the legislative bodies , and it certainly cannot replace the legislative powers conferred by the Treaties on Parliament and the Council .
In short , this probably would have been a redistribution of roles under the worst of circumstances .
On the other hand , the Romanian authorities must provide , in keeping with EU procedures , the cofinancing portion for implementing the projects so that they can be implemented as quickly as possible once the EU money has been received .
We have , in fact , tried to prepare a document - which I hope will be approved - that can be presented to the Council of 29 and 30 October .
( EL ) Mr President , 1 December was World AIDS Day , a day of remembrance for all the victims of the disease which remains the scourge of our planet .
Your position today has convinced me that you will make waves during the six months of your Presidency .
It is money that belongs to our citizens , and they must have a right to know what it is being spent on .
The process of strengthening relations between the European Union and the countries of the Southern Caucasus , including Georgia , is vital if we are to create a solid , coherent and effective foreign policy .
Have you received a response ?
Commissioner , I do not want to talk to you about politics this afternoon ; I do not want to talk to you about the Middle East , conflicts , bargaining or prisoner exchanges .
Mr President , I rise to speak in favour of the financial transaction tax ( FTT ) .
To conclude , there are those who claim that FRONTEX is somehow not respecting , or does not have the mandate to respect , human rights .
He has been my special adviser since 1 April 2006 and his mandate was renewed in 2008 for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2009 .
Furthermore , such a programme would not be acceptable to some of the Member States as it would be tantamount to a cutting back of the balancing out arrangement and also of the quotas .
There is no objective standard for taxation , and it is therefore not possible to accuse those states that apply low company taxation levels of fiscal dumping .
The fund provides an annual amount of EUR 500 million for such cases .

If one of these preconditions is lacking , though , you will not get Europeans to give up more sovereignty to these institutions that we currently find ourselves in .
As Afghanistan will make or break the fight against international terrorism , additional budgetary efforts are more than welcome .

The European Commission is proposing through the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation to remove the current exemption in the automotive sector and introduce general competition rules .
It should not be seen as a simple transformation of the intergovernmental initiative , but rather as a real tool which , based on experience , will bring real added value , both through the impetus it may give to the promotion of European values by Member States or local authorities and in terms of our citizens ' knowledge of these values .
In order to be effective , it should be a global tax , and I support measures to introduce such a charge on financial transactions .

This version is considered therefore to offer sufficient guarantees .
Thank you for reminding us of that and for making that nice mention .
The proposal has three elements .
What does that mean ?

People are being evicted who were already evicted in 2005 in Operation Murambatsvina , which incidentally means ' clean out the trash ' .
I am glad Parliament has finally initiated an in - depth examination of this issue .

Mrs Bauer has noted that in the so - called male professions the work of women is routinely undervalued for no objective reason .

The Market Access Strategy , and particularly the Market Access Partnership launched in 2007 , is the centrepiece of the Commission 's work in that respect .

The ECB 's additional role during the crisis has been to expand liquidity provisions through the use of non - standard measures .
First of all , it seems to me that the debate has clearly shown that Parliament 's welcomes the idea of social reality stocktaking , and though I agree with Mr Cercas that diagnosis is not the same as therapy , I am also of the opinion that no therapy is possible without diagnosis .
We also appreciate your comments on immigration , although not always your actions , and we appreciate the fact that emphasis has been placed on the positive aspects of immigration and not just on its illegality , as perhaps your predecessor did .

Commissioner , it is not true that workers can decide for themselves .
It is a sad statement of fact that although we have been since 2004 a full member of the European Union where free movement of people is guaranteed , although we are Schengen members and , as I believe , soon we will also be members of the Economic and Monetary Union , to this date the citizens of our country still have to cope with obstacles and a lack of transparency concerning employment and they often find themselves in jobs that are below their qualifications in spite of their education level or work under far worse financial conditions than their colleagues .
The next item is the statement by the Vice - President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Côte d'Ivoire .

The children are aged four and fourteen .
At the same time , I would very much like it if this debate was not an anti - Russian one , because those present in this House , those who take the floor , should be familiar with the ethnic map of Ukraine , and should know which counties were affected by this Stalinist horror , by means of which the Communist dictatorship strove to exterminate the peasantry - for the most part those who died were Ukrainians , but not exclusively Ukrainians .

( PT ) Madam President , indifferent to the economic and social devastation caused by the structural changes approved by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) in countries like Greece , the leaders of the European Union are now stepping up their offensive and launching themselves on Portugal with the same approach and unbridled colonial arrogance .

The New Democracy ( ND ) government and its MEPs who have actively supported today 's decision are largely responsible .
Our fate is in your hands , but you must have the courage to take the initiative now .

I want to warmly thank all my fellow Members for their proposals , especially the shadow rapporteurs , the PSE secretariat and the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy because , with their help , we have managed - I believe - to strengthen the directive on energy labelling .
This area will be the largest area of inter - regional cooperation ; it will highlight the lack of progress in the multilateral negotiations in question and in inter - regional negotiations .
There are many positive objectives in the report , such as working for public health and against discrimination , and accessibility for disabled persons , but in spite of that there are too many calls and demands for detailed regulations which should not be made at EU level .

What is more , all the migrants who arrive on our shores , though they are increasingly fewer in number , say in so many words that they would rather drown on the way here than go back to Libya , because of the rapes , torture , abuse , forced repatriations , mass expulsions and racist acts .
The crisis is an enormous test for Europe .
I am very pleased that the Ukrainian Government has managed to stabilise the situation .

Member States are forced into separate negotiations concerning issues that , in large part , fall within the competence of the Community .
I firmly believe that we will succeed in protecting the diversity of Slovak language and culture .
That is why I , and why we , think it is crucial , over and above the uniform transposition of this 2004 directive on the quality and safety of tissues and cells , which has already been mentioned , and which is the subject of our second question , that Europe strongly encourages the Member States to simplify their maternity hospital accreditation procedures and systems .
As the year went on , we also had the opportunity to listen to an address by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople , Bartholomew I. With your speech today , Chief Rabbi , we will have heard from representatives of Judaism , Christianity and Islam .
However , we would like to state that in recital G ' sexual and reproductive health ' should not be seen as a step backwards in relation to decisions that have already been made .

In the years 2007-2013 Poland will receive over EUR 67 billion from the European Union budget .

on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , this week 's Council takes place somewhere along the road between despair and hope .
SMEs are particularly susceptible to such contemporary phenomena unless these are curbed by means of countermeasures , information , supervision and training .
I say this because if we fail to be credible on our immigration policy , we cannot expect our citizens to trust us to open up our markets to legal migration .
The problem is that the Council 's current role is transferred to the Commission and that the scope for cooperation is severely reduced .
Energy efficiency mostly concerns buildings because there is a huge potential in energy efficiency in buildings .
Eurobarometer surveys show that 70 % to 80 % of EU citizens believe we need a common security and defence policy .
This own - initiative report rightly recognises the crucial role of consumer organisations , which are the ideal organisations for alerting public authorities to the problems consumers experience in their daily lives .
This strategy has never been so crucial , precisely in this period of economic slowdown , and the structural reforms have to be able to take their course .
The Western Balkans and Serbia are more than just a region of strategic interest to the European Union , and not only do the citizens in this region need us , but we all need them .
( Applause )
A colleague of mine has described it thus : this report has a whiff of the Cold War about it .
Consequently it would be pointless as far as equality is concerned to sacrifice another quarter of a century in the name of higher summits .
I just said that we should involve our citizens so that they can do something in their own houses .
That is why the destruction of opium poppy plantations without offering alternative means of earning a living is not an effective solution .
You regret having obtained the agreement of Brussels for a drop in oil taxation , but that is simply a consequence of the Treaties of Nice and Amsterdam , which you ratified through the parliamentary route .
Against this backdrop , harmonisation of the law on consumer credit has its limits and should be done cautiously and gradually .
The constant calls since it was founded for wages to be cut and capitalist restructurings to be speeded up found fertile soil in the capitalist crisis .
I would like to give a brief overview of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy 's report on a Commission communication on CCS demonstration facilities .
Russia and Ukraine have expressed concerns regarding the issue of visas to drivers , including coach drivers , and to couriers .
When the House votes in a moment , Mr President , I will take the opportunity to congratulate all the political groups for the support that they have given to this matter , as well as the Taiwanese people , the Taiwanese authorities , and their extremely strong diplomatic team .
I did so at the beginning , in the presence of Prime Minister Topolánek .
This is about legislation at European level .
The central idea is therefore to reinforce the consumer 's position in any negotiations to purchase rights of use .
One solution could be to oblige initiators to maintain an Internet site containing financial information , such as sources of income , expenses and financial reports .
However , I want to make it clear that I oppose the ongoing liberalisation of railways in the European Union , which is responsible for the fragmentation , lack of investment and ineffectiveness of rail freight today .
Firstly , I would like to thank you and the European citizens who have expressed their sympathy in relation with the disaster in Hungary .
( The President cut off the speaker )
I find it very difficult to agree to Amendment 2 .
The following have forfeited their entitlement to the subsistence allowance : Jim Allister for 3 days , Godfrey Blum for 2 days , Sylwester Chruszcz for 2 days , Paul Marie Coûteaux for 5 days , Maciej Marian Giertych for 3 days , Roger Helmer for 3 days , Roger Knapman for 3 days , Hans - Peter Martin for 3 days and Philippe de Villiers for 3 days .
It is a serious problem , but it is a problem that can be resolved .
This is currently a concern which I completely understand , but some Members also have prejudices .
In the international arena and on the European political scene , we cannot simply transfer the national model of separation of powers and checks and balances .
The Commission proposal aims at the introduction of a unilateral and temporary suspension of import duties on 75 export items from Pakistan .
While we admire the Chinese culture and make progress in exchanging goods and investments , it is our duty to speak loudly and clearly and condemn the killings and executions .
Because Mr Corbett does not think they should be allowed to !
As always , the question arises of whose security is being defended .
I must say that I am very happy that the majority supports smoking bans and all the other measures that promote smoking prevention .
That is why we have raised this question with the national regulators , and we are monitoring this problem with the European Regulators Group .
This is also one of the reasons why I voted for this report and I would like to add the need to give increased attention to ports , since 6 out of the 7 ultra peripheral regions are islands .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a short while ago , I gave a speech about my work in the European Parliament , about my tasks here and about my many appointments .
( RO ) Madam President , please allow me to thank Commissioner Frattini for his answer .
I have the impression , however , that an attempt is being made to latch on to this established movement in order to impose discrimination against the family founded on marriage between a man and a woman and against religious freedom , especially as concerns religious schools .
By saying that it is in Cyprus not for the benefit of the Turkish Cypriots , but for Turkey 's strategic interests .

In the case of ACTA , a handful of countries have negotiated among themselves the rules that are to prevail in the area of intellectual property rights .

We are against measures which impose obligations on small shops to collect , without limitation , small appliances without the consumer being required to purchase a new , similar appliance in return .
Also , habits in alcohol consumption vary widely in different parts of Europe .
I believe that fears that extending maternity leave on full pay from 14 to 20 weeks will penalise women are unfounded : it is our specific duty to protect the weakest workers , allowing them the right to stay at home with their children .
We must remember that this is a completely new situation for the people of the far north , and also for the fauna and flora .
The debate will take place on Wednesday afternoon in the presence of the Chairman of the Council of Foreign Ministers , Czech Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg .
The priorities should be energy content , eco - efficiency and low - emission technology and its development .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.00 .
Of course , we talk a great deal , we talk about economic governance , we also talk about monetary governance , but we could make matters a great deal simpler and certainly more effective if we devised and implemented real budgetary coordination of the euro area members .
Only the rich can choose alternative services in other countries , and in so doing they undermine the public health care system that is the safety net of the poor .
We have hitherto been concentrating far too much on promoting cultural diversity via the Muslim immigrant population without ensuring that our own culture , in turn , is recognised in the countries of the Islamic world .
Clearly , today , we are failing on that score .
During that discussion , it was particularly Mr Lehne , who was shadow rapporteur for this report , who suggested that Member States should already be given the option of excluding micro - entities , the really small companies , from this European legislation at this stage .
Some steps forward have been made in the last few years at European level , especially through a 2009 directive , but there is still much to do , especially to guarantee full civil rights to sufferers from this condition in the world of work and of mobility , and in guaranteeing the availability of medication during school hours .
The formation of this group is causing anxiety and fear in neighbouring countries , primarily Slovakia , Romania and Serbia .
They are still allowing youth unemployment , which is reaching rates double those of overall unemployment and which affects many young people with higher education who cannot find work , and even less so work that has anything to do with their education .
However , this is essentially an intergovernmental organism whose decisions , which affect us all , have to be implemented nationally .
North Korea (
Here culture clearly draws the shorter straw and is in a weaker position than European internal market law .
In addition , we are still waiting for specific tasks and objectives to be defined for the EEAS staff .
Since this is a disease where the medication costs are very high and cannot be met by the majority of patients , increased funding for these drugs is desirable .
For us , Galileo is one of the most important , if not the most important , industrial policy projects and we must ensure that it runs smoothly .
- ( NL ) Mr President , the longer we go on the more the European mandarins behave like a breed of political autistics , completely closed off from the real world , from the citizens , whom they nevertheless still claim to serve .
I will mention several figures which will fully demonstrate the absurdity of this assumption .
We really need to be realistic in our assessment of the situation , for even if we succeed in convincing the Americans to join in the emissions trading system we shall still be faced with a list of other countries around the world and I personally am not sure how we are ever going to start talking to them .
Mr President , first , could I repeat in public my own congratulations to Commissioner Füle .
The primary reason why they are not more widespread is that these systems are expensive , and the appropriate information and intelligent infrastructure are lacking .
We are debating the persecution of Christians around the world , but while we are talking about the violence that has taken place in Iraq , Egypt , the Philippines , India and elsewhere , we continue to ignore what has happened closer to home .
We also reject the proposal on CO 2 duties .
Only then will we have sensible prices .
Question Time ( Commission )
It needs to take on more employees specialised in development .
EPAs may not be perfect but many of my friends and family in poorer countries are fed up at the lack of access to goods and services and at being forced to rely on state - run monopolies or companies with links to corrupt politicians .
Now the farmers ' unions are beginning to foresee benefits to animal health and welfare through the use of cloning .
We were therefore obliged to include specific articles to cover the illegal use , trade and acquisition of firearms . This compromise takes account of these requirements .
However , they do not use it for micro - credits .
Resumption of the session
There is , however , work to be done ; we have European neighbours that have not fully abolished this practice and it should remain our focus to continue our efforts toward complete abolition .
Criminals tend to evade controls , of course , and we must have the technological instruments to prevent that from happening , such as the use of biometrics , showing full respect for everyone 's freedom but in order - as it were - to ward off temptation .
I said this before and I want to hear it again clearly .
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes
We have therefore proposed and agreed to this measure as a temporary measure until we have framework directives that establish clear rules .
We must do more to raise its profile .
Today , we have strengthened women 's rights , but also those of men , with this paternity leave .
Even the simplest of fishermen would be able to tell you that the tide comes in and the tide goes out .
It is work for those in the pipeline industry .
In any case , the ambitious goal of getting the economic crisis under control could not be achieved .
Mr President , it was in this very House , almost seven years ago , at the end of the constitutional convention , when we Members of the European Parliament and members of the national parliaments succeeded in putting forward a proposal that was accepted by the Presidium .
Commissioner Kroes , I would also ask that , at all events , this investigation start quickly - I agree wholeheartedly with Mr Langen on this - and that the information not originate solely from the acquiring party , as a dossier submitted by Magna to the Commission is likely to demonstrate what Magna wants it to demonstrate .
This leads to your fourth question on the transparency principle and the principle of good administration .
Our guiding principle in evaluating the amendments was always the conviction that changes to the current system of coordination should in no event lead to a reduction of citizens ' rights .
I think that this is highly inconsistent with the general spirit of the Lisbon Strategy .
I know that this is one area where there is not consensus in Europe at this stage .
They will probably now have to be reintegrated in the southern economy .
There is no direct link to our interinstitutional cooperation .
What I would therefore like to know is are you willing to stay all new authorisations and all renewals of authorisations , such as that of MON 810 , until the new EFSA rules have come into force ?
We need this capital to fill up the cap.
( SK ) I should first of all like to thank the rapporteur , Timothy Kirkhope , for including provisions on display in the regulation on a code of conduct for computerised reservation systems ( CRS ) .
If pedestrians are to be made visible by means of RFID clothing , it will be possible to monitor people 's every step .
Obscure privatisations and corruption , the lack of freedom of the press in parts of the country , the intimidation of NGOs : all this is making people lose heart and turn their back on the country .
This has been emphasised in the House on various occasions .
We agreed on emission reductions for international transport and , despite resistance from some corners , we put figures on the global financial need in developing countries to fight climate change .
Just as was the harbouring by Ireland of three IRA terrorists convicted in Colombia .
I should therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report and call on the European Commission to implement the proposals in the Bendtsen report , thereby helping our economies out of the crisis at the same time .
Europe is obliged to innovate if it is to survive globalisation .
The most essential thing to achieving that is for parties to have legal status , and that is what this report is proposing : parties that have a territorial presence and that , at the same time , conduct themselves according to democratic rules ; and a differentiation between recognition of the parties and financing , which requires popular support .
Without clear and careful coordination and clear rules at a European Union or Euro Zone level , it will be difficult to manage these very challenging processes .
It is , however , true that there were shortcomings in the supervision mechanisms , which , we should remember , are essentially national systems .
To this end , it will be essential to create not only a programme , but also a special fund for the resettlement of refugees in the Union .
The debate is closed .
We received over 700 such papers from national governments , from European - level associations , from businesses , from universities , and from regional and local organisations .
The number of errors has fallen , but we have still not reached the ' tolerable error level ' .
Surely , there is great enthusiasm to introduce a new tax on financial transactions .
It should also be a warning to the naive people who think Iran can be handled with kid gloves .
We are threatened by a diminution in the working - age population , a fall in economic competitiveness and a decrease in funding for social care and keeping pension systems in equilibrium .
If we do not get this Treaty , we will have a Europe with fewer social rights .
Member States have developed their own safety standards , primarily for national routes , based on national technical and operational concepts .
We do not want this !
I firmly believe these partnerships will only succeed if they are anchored in an enduring partnership based on trust and mutual respect .
It is unfortunate that the partnership principle is not always adhered to in the spending of structural funds .
I believe that the role of the state in this is a limited one - it should not seek to abrogate the rights and duties of parents , of the churches and of schools .
( 12475/2004 - 11803/2004 - C 6-0118/2005 - .
Following this , the scale of charges and common time periods for examining applications in the different countries should be harmonised , and the authorisation process should be simplified in the case of formulations with minimal differences or variations in colour , for example , thus avoiding extra specific tests requiring further evaluation by each Member State .
Concerning support to apiaries in difficulty , I would like to tell you that the Commission is glad to see that the number of hives increased between 2004 and 2007 - and this not counting enlargement .
But the sourcing of raw materials in processed food is irreversibly complex , as ingredients are chosen based on price , quality and availability and countries of origin in a single meat processing plant may alter day by day , and even hour by hour .
( Interruption from another Member )
The way forward for a democratic Europe is not putrid compromises , paltry promises and immoral threats .
However , many Member States also have independent supervisors who apply and elaborate legislation .
People in this age group bring added value to the world of work , and therefore preparatory measures should be taken to involve them more .
( The President cut off the speaker )
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , food and hygiene go together ; there is absolutely no doubt about that .
That is my main point of criticism and it prompted me not to vote for the report .
It would be nice if this example in this Chamber could be followed by many further examples .
I am , of course , delighted on behalf of our group to welcome the fact that Taiwanese citizens will soon be able to enter the Schengen zone without needing a visa - also known in EU jargon terms as a visa liberalisation for Taiwan .
( PL ) Mr President , there are several aspects that we must consider while discussing the European Union 's common foreign policy today .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , my group supports the publication of this Green Paper .
Their average emissions reduction between 2009 and 2015 would have been 23 % , compared with just 10 % for their Korean counterparts , which account for 95 % of total car sales in Korea .
This is the position that we need to strengthen and help to consolidate .
The Exchange Programme for Entrepreneurs is a good approach in this connection .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , let me first make two preliminary remarks .
On the basis of applications for assistance by Poland , Slovakia , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Romania and candidate country Croatia relating to the flooding disasters of May , June and July 2010 , it proposes the application of the EU Solidarity Fund .
It needs and deserves democracy .
With a higher percentage of protein crops in crop rotation , soil fertility and structure , nutrient storage and the health of the crops which follow is improved .
We are part of a community of peoples who guarantee the rights of citizens , strive for peace and prosperity and want to live in peace .
Several of my colleagues in the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and in other groups also voted against the own - initiative report - each having his or her own reasons .
As Mr Kalinowski said , agricultural products which are produced in line with other standards are imported to EU markets , while European farmers incur huge costs associated with animal welfare or environmental protection .
Recently the EU voted against an amendment placed before the Committee on Budgets that sought to divert EU funding that goes into institutions towards community - and family - based services .
That said , we do need to know what financial obligations we are taking on in the longer term .
It will be clear to anybody listening to this debate just what differences there were between the groups and what a difficult process this has sometimes been .
In great European cities , there are already parking facilities that provide tourists with bicycles , free of charge , during the entire period of stay of the vehicles .
Will Georgia or Ukraine join NATO when its reforms have been carried out ?
I prefer to see it grown here rather than imported from elsewhere .
They do not dare to complain about the fact that they are treated badly or about violence or sexual exploitation .
The first situation , relating to social welfare , is where a worker is unable to earn enough to lead a dignified life due to physical or mental disabilities , or other related reasons .
This is the first thing .
Second , reducing protectionist tendencies .
Furthermore , it adds new points to what Parliament has already said in the past , such as asking the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice - President of the Commission to assess the results of the investigations by all parties and report back to Parliament , recalls that the responsibility and credibility of the EU and its Member States require full monitoring of the investigations and shows concern about pressure put on NGOs involved in the drawing up of the Goldstone report and in the follow - up investigations , including reference to the restrictive measures imposed on their activities .
However , it seems that it can offer , if not solutions , at least interesting food for thought : it appears obvious to me that training and education should be at the heart of the political priorities of today and of tomorrow .
Its renewal therefore confirms this success and we hope that it will continue to do so in the future .
We still need an evaluation .
Afghanistan cannot do without reliable administration .
There is indeed , as earlier speakers have said , considerable overlap between their programmes , and I believe that their management and administration , at least , could usefully be merged .
Secondly , on the politics of it , this was the first real vote on climate change .
Madam President , I support this report because it addresses the issue of diversity and our agricultural policy between the regions .
In today 's global context , innovation policy has a huge impact on all areas of life and , in future , it will become the main pillar of economic , cultural and social development in the European Union .
As Mrs Gebhardt said , Rome III really has at its heart the intention of protecting the weaker spouse at the point when marriage contracts are being concluded .
- Before the vote :
I think it is a positive development that we are going to have the courage to channel it through the Afghan Government 's budget in future .
I would ask the President , in that letter , to remind those teams that there is a fine tradition of sportspeople withdrawing from events on human rights grounds - from Muhammad Ali and Vietnam to cricketers refusing to go to South Africa under apartheid and athletes to the Moscow Olympics .
An EU - inspired crisis will shortly hit the UK egg industry .
( PL ) Mr President , European and third - country consumers receive too little information about the quality and standards of European food .
Although the economic and financial crisis has had a significant impact on the level of unemployment of both sexes , this crisis has affected women worst .
Madam President , that is the end of my speech on the subject we are dealing with at the moment and , like you , I would like to dedicate a few minutes , which are my last , to saying some words of farewell .
We are not having a debate now .
If , last week , that authority was weakened by the way in which the most senior leaders of the European Union were elected , it is regained by debates just such as this one today .
I should therefore like to take a few moments to inform you of the position prevailing in the Council on the main issues which are addressed by the three rapporteurs , Mrs Trautmann , Mrs del Castillo and Mr Harbour .
in writing . - ( PL ) I voted in favour of the report by Mr Reul on conventional energy sources and energy technology .
A just peace , which is only possible by respecting the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to an independent and sovereign state , with the 1967 borders and its capital in East Jerusalem !
in writing . - ( SV ) The European Parliament 's amendments improve the legislation , but at the same time I do not want to vote for its implementation .
I must also say that I agree with Mr Kirkhope 's assessment of the importance of distinguishing between asylum and the immigration of workers .
When we asked you , in the Committee on Legal Affairs , why you had not presented proposals such as those as outlined in the Lévai report in Parliament , you said that the market would move in this direction anyway and you therefore saw no need for any change here .
Latvia notes with pleasure the European Commission 's proposals in this regard .
I myself make an effort every few months to alert stakeholders to the various consultation processes that are ongoing and I genuinely believe and would ask you , Commissioner , if you do not agree that it would be very useful for the Commission offices in each country to draw up a list , a very wide - ranging list , of all stakeholders and ensure that they are alerted to the consultation process , so that they would know and could take part .
Mr Amato chooses to be absent from meetings on the subject .
Evidence of this is the registration of the ' For Freedom ' movement , allowing opposition papers to be printed and distributed , and the country 's openness to the Eastern Partnership Initiative .
We believe that these funds will end up in the pockets of the multinational companies in control of the development programmes .
in writing . - The proposal for a directive on the European Protection Order , submitted by 12 Member States , is an initiative aimed at preventing crime .
European Network and Information Security Agency (
It is a very sensitive stage of their life and we have to do our utmost to provide some form of security and protection for their own good .
Is it possible to adapt the Water Framework Directive so that in the future , storage power plants can also be given an opportunity to ensure there is a balance between solar energy and , on the other hand , wind energy ?
No , we will leave it to our Irish colleagues to analyse the reasons for such an outcome and also to propose their vision of a possible way out .
I have a comment and a question to Mr Cohn - Bendit , lest you think that Irish ears are not listening to you .
What we do not consider to be correct and what bothers us is the hidden agenda promoted here by some Member States and partly by the Commission and some groups of MEPs as well .
It is even sadder that some political forces are treating these events as interference in Italy 's domestic affairs and are trying to make political capital out of the gypsy issue .
We shall not be making concessions on those positions .
This procedure will ensure a standard approach to all applications , thereby eliminating the risk of any ' gateways ' to the Schengen area appearing .
Meanwhile , Mr Barroso , the summit did not even place it on its agenda .
You will see that it contains significant and detailed legally binding commitments on the way that the US Treasury Department can process data under the agreement .
the report by Helmut Scholz , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1934/2006 establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high income countries and territories - C 7-0101/2009 - and
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on 9 May , the EU , at the behest of the Ministers for the Economy and Finance , gave a firm response to the financial markets .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think the rapporteur , Mrs Meissner , must be congratulated .
I am confident that the proposed changes will have a positive impact on limiting financial irregularities .
The next EU - Russia summit is another opportunity to continue these discussions .
I refuse to believe , therefore , that we are dealing with a kind of industrial dinosaur that is doomed to extinction in the very near future .
Member of the Commission . - ( RO ) I can only repeat what I have just said , namely that , by the actions taken by the European Commission to support language diversity , not only the 23 official languages are supported , but also the other languages spoken in the European Union , including the regional languages , the less widespread languages .
The Commission is now finalising the new and thorough assessment of each of these requests . It expects to inform Ireland of its results in July of this year .
I repeat that , in the opinion of the Presidency at the moment , the time for such debates has not yet come , but we have to appreciate the fact that , out of a possible 27 ratifications , only five have so far been secured .
Now , with regard to the upcoming summit , I would like to highlight four issues .
We have to look at the entire supply chain and the entire car market which , of course , also includes the vehicle trade and vehicle repair shops .
The random use of antibiotics in agriculture is - or has been - common to all farming , be it large or small .
I would like to invite the Committee of the Regions to study this area and begin a broad consultation in the rural regions to learn more about life there with all its advantages and disadvantages .

I sincerely admire the idealism of the rapporteur , Tadeusz Zwiefka .
However , Internet commerce also gives rise to questions , especially about the sale of counterfeit products which are protected by intellectual property rights .
We can only make progress here if Parliament receives the information it has asked for - proper information , not fragments .
However , there are six points in particular in the report that I would like to highlight here this evening :
You must realise that all of the negotiations today in Luxembourg and next week in Brussels are being followed throughout the world .
I really think that we should take a stand on this and consider whether we should not have tightened up the rules .
Mr President , Mr Matsakis opened the debate wondering if there was one country responsible for encouraging the whole of the EU to ban the PMOI .
That is how I understand paragraph 4 .
Without Galileo , we will not have SESAR , and without SESAR , we will not achieve Single European Sky 2 .
We have seen what agreements are worth after a coup in the case of the readmission agreements .
It would be unfair and even immoral to change the rules at this stage in the game .
Mr President , the future of the common agricultural policy will see increased focus on connecting it with climate change policy .
It is five years since enlargement . It is now time to review things once again .
The fact that we are in an economic crisis does not make our problems of dependency disappear .
In the Commission 's view , the detention of Mr Hu Jia places an obligation on the EU to act in a firm manner because of the clear inference that he was arrested as a consequence of speaking freely and honestly about the repression of human rights defenders via a telephone link to a meeting of the European Parliament 's Subcommittee on Human Rights in November 2007 .
On the West Bank at the moment , there has been no improvement with the borders , or with freedom of movement .
There are a number of disparities , then , between the Member States , whether in terms of the grounds for accelerated procedures , or in terms of access to personal interviews or to effective remedy .
There is a need for continued detailed debate on the various issues it raises .
We believe it is important to have sensible regulations for products on the financial markets considering what happened , including in your country .
This , too , is human trafficking , and we must not be silent about it .
We should not see a repeat of the situation when the Commission did not want to provide the Parliament with information that was vital for its decision - making .
We are pleased about the reduction in the duration of proceedings but , on the other hand , we have observed a persistent backlog of cases .
The Commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of strategy papers , as those strategy papers supplement Regulation ( EC ) No 1889/2006 and are of general application .
Are you aware that the European Union will never implement this 2020 Strategy if we do not pool investments for the future , if , when you assess the public expenditure of Member States , the only expenditure that you treat differently , where you take quality into account , is when Member States introduce capital - funded pension reforms , whereas you ignore those who are inclined to make efforts with regard to education ?
That was how it sounded .
Again , it is due to this lack of political will that , by the end of the year , the EU still had not received a waste sorting plan .
The Agreement will not only make the Canadian and European markets more competitive , it will also make them safer as regulators and enforcement authorities are moving closer to cooperation in all matters of certification , inspections and enforcement , to ensure the highest level of safety for passengers and cargo flights .
Education is the only way to prevent HIV and AIDS , and I am pleased that the Commission subscribes to that view .
This message must say that ' no one should think that , having got over the worst part of this crisis , those former practices which led to the crisis can be allowed to redevelop , as if nothing had happened ' .
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law ( announcement of motions for resolutions tabled ) : see Minutes
Decisions concerning certain documents : see Minutes
Subsequent to my speech , not only did the Ambassador of Israel to Cyprus embark on a political defamation campaign against me , but , more importantly , the Speaker of the Knesset , Ms Dalia Itzik , wrote an official letter of complaint against me personally to the President of the European Parliament .
They do not have the infrastructure that is required for a modern ' state - to - be ' .
Mr President , I congratulate you on the decision you have just taken regarding quorums in the European Parliament .
The candidacy of the State President in parliamentary elections is an unknown precedent in the history of a democratic state , just like the nomination of the head of the radical movement ' Nashi ' for the post of minister for youth affairs and the refusal to receive a delegation from the European Parliament 's Subcommittee on Human Rights .
It is supposed to bring improvements in administration , flexibility , security and data storage capacities , as well as providing other new functionalities .
As in the case of road transport , we should seek more intelligent solutions .
The European legislation represents the framework for safety and environmental protection measures , both in general and in the event of a specific accident .
To conclude , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Dalli and the rapporteurs for the good work carried out on this sensitive topic .

Both the letter and the spirit of the Treaty of Lisbon are very clear .
There was a very strong financial outcome , there was very clear ownership of Haiti 's Government and there were many stakeholders .
Mr Kubik performed very well during the European Parliament hearing , and his candidature has not raised any doubts .
It will be interesting to see how all of the anti - wrinkle cream that we put on our faces , and which clearly does not work , will be sold in future .
You do agree , do n't you ?
The main thing , of course , is that we should be able to export our products to those countries .
Ladies and gentlemen , we need a transport system that is competitive , sustainable and environmentally friendly and does not rule out road transport , because at the moment , it is the only way to get everywhere .
I voted for the report on a new strategy for Afghanistan .
This was always the Commission 's intention .
We would call on the Council and the Commission to keep us informed of their negotiations .
I also merely wanted to clarify that paragraph 54 , which deals with public services , services of general interest , is problematic , and we therefore voted against part of this paragraph , which continues to call , ideologically but in veiled terms , for further liberalisation .
The Stockholm Programme adopted by the European Council on 10 and 11 December 2009 expressed the view that labour immigration may increase competitiveness and economic vitality .
( Applause )
( PL ) Mr President , Commissioner , the mobile telephone and the Internet have become symbols of mobility and innovation .

I said this at the time when my appointment was approved by Parliament .
In Gaza , Hamas has created a terrorist fiefdom : it tolerates no opposition to its views , it has murdered those Palestinians who opposed it , it has split the Palestine Authority , it refused to stop terror attacks on Israeli civilians , it refused to recognise the right of Israel to exist , it refused to acknowledge the peace agreements previously negotiated .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , economic policy coordination , growth , employment , innovation , social inclusion : those are the slogans of the new 2020 strategy , that is , the one which , after the Lisbon Strategy , is supposed to guide Europe towards the end of the crisis that is weakening Europeans ' spending power and spirits .
Despite the declarations which have been made , both in the Eastern Partnership and the Black Sea Synergy programmes , construction of the Nabucco gas pipeline , which is to connect deposits in Asia with users in Europe , continues to be postponed .
It should provide incentives to renew fleets and create more efficient , more modern aircraft .
The Commission proposal suggests a maximum emission target of 120 grams of CO 2 in 2012 , which was retabled as an amendment .
The current Portuguese Presidency is even aiming to strengthen European relations with Africa in this context .
Perhaps those who are more vulnerable , namely employees who have lost their jobs , are once again at a loss as to what they are being punished for .
This anti - grassroots EU policy also bears the hallmark of the PASOK and New Democracy parties , which continue to support the choices of capital , while shifting the consequences of the crisis on to the workers ' shoulders .
If they are not allowed to annex to Albania , they want true independence .
An appropriate balance has to be found between maintaining national social security traditions , which are important in each of our Member States , and making the changes which are vital for facilitating cross - border mobility .
I cannot believe that anyone in this House believes that a right to privacy is a right to evade tax .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , here in the European Parliament , we have been debating the Services Directive for a long time , and we have expressed many concerns in our debates about how it should be implemented and how we can ensure that service providers have free movement within the European Union .
Turkey would help spread stability in the volatile regions beyond its eastern and southern borders .
Rather , we need to demand implementation and a review and to be realistic so that the standards we have established are also put into practice .
I would like to stress three points .
Allow me to recall once again that , if this directive is applied to the trans - European network , it will save more than 600 lives and prevent around 7 000 accidents every year .
All actors operating in this field will have to take note of that .
Secondly , if we returned to the drachma without abolishing the euro area and the euro , there would be no legal facility for automatically converting deposits in euros in Greek banks , both inside and outside Greece , to drachmas without the depositor 's consent .
It is between 21 % and 30 % , therefore clearly above the 15 % for Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) .
At present we are seeing time and again in Greece , Portugal and Ireland that , under pressure from the European Commission , in negotiations with the national governments results and packages have been put together in which it is the weakest that suffer , and in which the wealthy - who did very well out of the previous 20 years - are left alone .
Do you see a need to modify the Television Directive based on the new technical regulations ?
To the supervisory authority the CE marking is the only indication as to whether conformity , that is to say de facto safety , has been assessed .
As you very well know , it is a strategy which is intended to bring our citizens work , prosperity and stability throughout the Union for a whole decade .
It was worth the effort .
On Friday , the ministers from France , the Czech Republic and Sweden adopted a plan of action .
I would therefore like to highlight the urgent need to support growth through investment in knowledge - based economic sectors .
If you look through your interventions , you will see that there is a considerable convergence in the goals we would like to achieve together .
The Member States must be able to decide how many migrants with sound qualifications are needed and to set to work in their countries without causing a brain drain in sensitive sectors , such as health care , in the third countries .
Through this report , the European Union is inviting the European Spring Council to give a strong political impetus and draw up a roadmap for all the legal initiatives in order to guarantee , along with Parliament , that they will be adopted in good time .
This is more effective than broader sanctions in the form of general trade embargoes or other more arbitrary measures .
Whether the reform package and reform laws will actually be implemented in practice remains to be seen .
It will take extensive initiatives from the European Commission to correct this situation , and it is therefore necessary for the European Commission to be informed in its work in a qualified and detailed way , both by Member States and by the private sector .
The objective of the impact and sustainable development assessment was to analyse the economic , social and environmental impact of the future free trade agreement and to identify any necessary support measures .
This issue will not be discussed at this summit , but we will discuss enlargement later in the autumn , with a possible decision being taken in December .
There is a sea change under way in the Arab world .
I can in no way agree that the natural environment in Europe can be made slave to EU external energy policy , when in recent years Europe has spoken out forcefully for environmental protection .
The whole thrust of CAP reform now is to give support to farmers for environmental reasons , but also very much to push them in the direction of producing for the market place .
It undermines the fundamental rights of our people and the foundations of our democracy .
Go to the places where freedoms are ignored , human rights are restricted , and there is still war and conflict .
Mr President , Commissioner Ferrero - Waldner spoke of the importance of getting the relationship between the EU and Russia right .
No amendments .
In principle , financial support to help Member States in further building up national capacities to implement improvements and create new tools for statistical data collection should be included .
Therefore , I think we will need to consider how best to proceed but , given the nature of this assistance , I think we have to reflect very carefully on that .
That should not be allowed .
They recommend that immunity be lifted , although Mr Vanhecke is not the author of the controversial text , and the Belgian Constitution clearly stipulates that only the author can be prosecuted if known .
At the same time , I agree with my fellow Members who say that the Court of Auditors ' report contains not only positive points , but also downright appalling and alarming ones .
As you well know , under Community legislation , every request for asylum or residence must be examined in the Member State first entered by the applicant , regardless of his or her actual destination .
In Germany , I feel that I have been provided with sufficient information on how I should behave .
I voted in favour of this report as the Rules of Procedure of the Court of First Instance lack any provision as to the language required to be used in appeal proceedings ( against decisions of the Civil Service Tribunal ) .
This directive will not only help boost efficiency in this area relating to the recovery of claims , but will also help the single market operate better .
It seems to me that our position and our targets really do set the pace in terms of the changes needed in order to pre - empt ecological disaster .
In low - income countries the fact that testing is voluntary is a serious obstacle to combating the AIDS pandemic .
Thank you for your attention .
The problem being dealt with today is essentially an administrative matter , a matter related to internal order in Venezuela , a matter which is being resolved and what is more , has even been resolved according to information we have .
All of us in this Chamber have the political responsibility to make this happen .
She has always indicated her support for improving consumer confidence .
This is unacceptable .
I understand that the rationale behind this suggestion was not to achieve such an outcome , but believe that this would actually restrict patients ' rights as defined by the Court .
The approach outlined in the recommendation has proved to be a step in the right direction , especially during the economic crisis .
I believe we have succeeded in rounding off the procedure or system in those areas where certain issues were missing , such as getting subsequent administrative offences once the information has been exchanged and notification made .
Once again , I would stress the absolute need for consistency between internal and external processes , as you have already mentioned , Mrs Reding .
I also call on the Commission to take concrete action and initiatives to combat direct and indirect discrimination against Roma in Europe .
25 .
Anyway , thank you and we will undoubtedly speak about this again .
I feel that , very often , that economic role is ignored , and we do not talk about it ; we do not even think about it , and we relegate culture to second - class status .
Today three quarters of all rice consumed in Haiti is imported from the USA .
The strategic partnership with Brazil is a decision in favour of Brazil and in favour of Mercosur .
Madam President , this is essentially an issue that concerns not only SMEs , but all enterprises facing this kind of competition .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
I believe that the Commission has done a great deal towards achieving these objectives .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , we are looking at the progress that the European Union has made towards becoming this area of freedom , security and justice .
I hope in the next four weeks , in this campaign , that the voters of Europe can see the real face of this project .
I believe we must all remind course providers that they can obtain funding for their proposed courses from the European Social Fund , for example , or from any of the structural funds .
This is excellent news , but it is mainly by focusing on these structural causes that the Commission will show that it has grasped the extent of the crisis and that it recognises that both it and the EU are fully accountable for what happens today .
They suddenly left .
That being said , we felt obliged not to vote on the regulation itself .
Technical and economic developments alone make this an absolute necessity .
This question , Jan Andersson , is about Social Europe .
These are undue administrative interference , insufficient respect for the freedom of expression and access of all parties to media , and an overall lack of public confidence in the democratic and electoral process .
As a Polish woman , I would also like to emphasise our solidarity with third country citizens legally residing in the European Union .
We are all responsible for the delays in achieving the Millennium Development Goals , which makes coordinated action by the EU and the UN a matter of urgency .
In committee we have therefore already put a stop to further wishful thinking , as a Member State which receives funds for its workers should already be aware of its responsibilities .
I would like to thank President Barroso for his particular contribution to getting the Nabucco project off the ground .
in writing . - ( BG ) The lack of suitable instruments for diagnosing public finance problems early , along with the poorly operating mechanisms of the Stability and Growth Pact , are among the basic causes of the long - running crisis which the euro area and EU are going through .
in writing . - A good report where , among other things , Parliament welcomes the fact that the agenda of the 16th regular session includes reports on the ' Rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ' , and on the ' Promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism ' , as well as extensive meetings on the rights of the child ; welcomes also this year 's nominations of Special Rapporteurs on these key topics , and takes note of the reports to be presented by the Special Rapporteurs on torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , on freedom of religion or belief , and on the situation of human rights defenders ; calls on the EU Member States to contribute actively to these debates .
The ' Blue Card ' offers an opportunity for migrants to settle with their families and work in our countries .
The next item is Question Time ( B 7-0407/2011 ) .
We therefore continuously encourage this dialogue and this search for a solution .
They actively opposed a requirement that product labels must show that pesticides used as preservatives are included , so that the consumers would be aware of the fact .
This is a good balance between intellectual property rights and the rights of consumers .
We are all aware that the current model of soft law imposes the requirement to undertake transposition into the national systems .
Firstly , a horizontal directive on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings , which will , for example , clearly establish the following enforceable rights : easily accessible victim support services in all Member States ; the right to interpretation during interviews ; a minimising of contact between the offender and the victim during proceedings , with any new courts to be designed so as to provide separate waiting areas ; and the right in all Member States to request a review of the prosecution .
One of the fundamental features of the revolutions in Central Europe in 1989 was the ability immediately to create genuine organisations to represent the democratic , secular revolutionary forces .
After the vote :
It should , however , be stressed - as you have done - that this measure will have to be approached in a realistic and pragmatic way .
Subject : Measures to promote family - friendly policies
In 2006 , the acknowledged needs of the new Member States made it necessary to revise the directive .
It is making a laughing stock of France by organising anti - French demonstrations in Paris because it was upset by French protests about the mistreatment of the people of Tibet , which it continues to oppress .
10 .
The ACP - EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique institution that has succeeded in establishing itself as a key player in European - African relations and in North - South relations .
That is another task for the Commission .
I once again urge my fellow Members to avoid any political games when voting on the amendments and to make sure there is a large absolute majority for this report on Turkey to be adopted in plenary .
I do not believe that we can any longer accept the continuation of this transitional system .
Rising fuel prices were also discussed last week by the G 8 finance ministers representing the most developed countries .
Some time ago , you announced that they were going to set up a kind of Chinese RAPEX system .
Only the partner countries are in a position to force us to provide more effective aid by actively defining not only their development objectives but also the means of achieving them .
in writing . - The EU as a bloc is the world 's largest contributor of humanitarian aid .
Trade policy cannot ignore any failure to respect workers ' rights and therefore , the development of society may continue only after these drawbacks are removed .
Let me say again : let us think before we act .
Yesterday the Danish Parliament refused a referendum on a Treaty they have not read .
Instead of talking about symptoms , it is time to get serious about the disease : the fact that we have used all the easy oil and are still addicted to the stuff .
( Applause )
On the borders , no answer and continuing generic waffle about enlargement , without raising the geopolitical problem of Europe 's borders which , for us , is the key issue .
How can you think that the standards of the OSCE and Council of Europe are too high for the European Union ?
I think that we should take far - reaching steps to defeat these diseases of civilisation .
In the meantime , we need to work on the remaining trade and economic problems , for example , the Siberian overflight fees , measures at the border that hamper the importation of commercial vehicles into Russia , the discriminatory road taxes , plans to limit the import of containers by road , export duties on timber and the protectionist measures Russia has recently taken .
On top of this , they have an essential role in combating climate change due to their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen .
In accordance with this code , the Union started making annual reports that are actually reports on completed arms transfers .
Europe must not hide when it is needed most .
From the perspective of our long - term energy security , nuclear energy is the solution that can guarantee a sufficient amount of energy with the lowest levels of carbon dioxide emissions and , therefore , we must place great emphasis on the related question of the safe storage and production of fuel .
A review of support tools is also appropriate in the context of an economic crisis that has had a particularly virulent effect on SMEs , as eloquently documented by the loss of 3 250 000 jobs between 2009 and 2010 alone ( more than a third of the new jobs that this sector had created ) .
( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , this agreement contains a clause that does not convince us and has never convinced us .
They also have problems of the first magnitude and I would like us not to transform what is a legitimate reflection on how to run major advanced economies better into a criticism of the euro which , as I said , has delivered exactly in line with what was expected .
It seems that the Council has either completely or partially failed to grasp the fact that improving quality and ensuring greater consistency and solidarity is not only in the interests of the asylum seeker , but also in the interests of the Member States themselves .
Thank you for listening .
Decisions concerning certain documents : see Minutes
As you can appreciate , I have been quite flexible about the timing , partly because all the speeches have been very agreeable as well as very powerful - the IMF , casinos and cholesterol - all great fuel for this discussion .
Here we have reached some important milestones .
First , there are tremendously dedicated people there doing the work to try to help the Haitians , and second , the Haitian people are a very proud people and we should recognise that at the beginning of this debate .
Forest cover is not only affected by forest policies , but also by other policies such as taxation policy , land tenure and rights .
Recent earthquake in Haiti ( motions for resolutions tabled ) : see Minutes
Freedom of movement between the two continents has thus become urgency and should constitute a priority topic already at the Prague meeting on 5th April 2009 .
This scheme will allow householders who are unable to meet their mortgage repayments to defer all their principal and up to 70 % of their interest payments for a period of two years .
Between the countries that are fearful of the effects of independence and those who dream only of validating their independence as soon as possible for various diplomatic reasons , Slovenia will initially have to ensure the cohesion of the Union by seeking first and foremost an internal compromise , if the EU 's foreign policy as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon is not to be trivialised or even ridiculed .
Well , this is what we have done here .
That is the kind of certainty citizens need .
The same can be said about the next 50 years .
Unfortunately , none of these amendments were adopted , and I therefore voted against the report .
We need a general agreement which provides a coherent and legally binding framework in order to protect personal data and to enforce the rights of individuals .
The vote will take place on Wednesday .
Secondly , who would benefit from this ?
Firstly , the common position introduces a provision which allows Member States to regulate or prohibit strictly for reasons other than safety during transport the transport of dangerous goods within their territory .
The EU should be deeply concerned for the resolution of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict which , in addition to the victims it has caused , has , for decades , created great instability in the region and in the world .
I would like to assure them that the Commission is giving careful consideration to the question of EIB regulatory supervision .
We are opposed to the fact that the report contains a number of aspects which have nothing to do with trade policy .
in writing . - I support this report , which calls for the EU to promote the introduction of a financial transaction tax ( FTT ) at global level , and failing that , as a first step , the EU should implement an FTT at European level .
We have a very responsible Commissioner , a compatriot of yours , Andris Piebalgs , who acquitted himself admirably last week and during the gas dispute with Russia and Ukraine , but especially with Russia .
I think these are the major points that I would like to make at this stage , but I am sure we can come back to this topic again , maybe after the meetings have taken place .
National declarations and the participation of Member States need a stronger legal basis .
In this regard , I can but fully endorse what Mr Barroso had to say .
Once again , I wish you complete success in your Presidency .
Amendment of Regulation ( Euratom , ECSC , EEC ) No 549/69 determining the categories of officials and other servants of the European Communities to whom the provisions of Article 12 , the second paragraph of Article 13 and Article 14 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the Communities apply (
I am afraid the wrong light came on when I pressed the button .
The Ombudsman produces an annual activity report .
Mr President , honourable Members , I would like to reflect briefly on two trains of thought .
This is a time for brave decisions at national level , with a long - term view and without cutting any corners .
However , I would like to take this opportunity to draw attention to the issue of the health and safety of workers employed in the construction sector .
The Europe we see now is the exact opposite of anything related to democracy .
I would like to start by thanking you all for a fascinating debate , for many interesting ideas , and for the enthusiasm and support you are showing for the EU 2020 strategy .
This is why it is important that we put as much money as possible into aid for areas affected by the Natura 2000 programme .
The various European commissioners involved will need to coordinate their approach so as to put an end to any action that excludes or discriminates against Roma people .
However , I very much doubt whether the proposition to regulate scores of airports throughout the EU is going to produce the utopia in airport charges that the airlines and the Commission want .
There was one main weakness , however , in that proposal , which is that there was no provision for the selling off of tyres that did not meet the new requirements after the implementation date .
It is also pursuing convergence objectives ( despite the damaging changes in this field since the last enlargement ) .
Anyone who has never lived under Communism cannot understand how much a person 's life and way of thinking can be affected by a totalitarian system .
This would go on to form part of the conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council , which took place in December 1992 .
I also welcome the important achievement that the principles of the Treaty , in particular transparency , non - discrimination and openness , will also be implemented in the defence and security market and , as has already been said , this will result in an improvement of the efficiency of defence spending .
Such situations , which are happening at an alarming rate , require decision makers to think carefully about the European economic and social model as well as its sustainability and its future .
The EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 increase of de minimis aid for companies for a period of only three years can help them in this complicated situation .
It is very disturbing to see how particular countries have so easily allowed Russia to manipulate them .
However , on the other hand , there have , in fact , already been very many such debates here , and we are very good at talking .
In the case of a nurse or an IT specialist , this is not needed to enable them to play a useful role in our companies .
The report has discussed that at length , so I shall not say any more about it here .
We have many concerns about the target , which was to halve the number of victims by 2010 .
In fact , regardless of which of these groups we find ourselves in today , we will all be held accountable for the future fate of the nations of Europe .
If we fail to regulate that properly , then I will no longer have any desire to work on the other sub - initiatives .
What does the Council intend to do to prevent speculation on Portuguese public debt ?
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on preparation for the European Council meeting of 4 February 2011 .
in writing . - ( PT ) The toy safety directive represents an extremely important step towards ensuring our children 's safety .
I think it is widely accepted now that we must have a sustainable biofuels strategy and , if we do not get it , then we have to look again at the targets we have set .
( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , World Intellectual Property Organisation figures clearly show that Europe 's problem is not a lack of new ideas ; what is missing is their transformation into business opportunities .
Lapsed written declarations : see Minutes
European politicians should not be supporting the dictatorship of globalism , but be dealing with the real issues : how to eradicate unemployment , halt mass immigration , and have the discriminatory and inhumane Beneš Decrees and the Slovak language law repealed . I also call on every colleague and fellow Member to support the aspirations for autonomy of the largest disenfranchised minority in Europe , the Hungarians living outside Hungary 's borders .
( Applause )
Concerning the third issue of tracking systems to locate containers at sea , this possibility could be further explored .
If the EU is to have credibility as a global power it needs to put its money where its mouth is .
Claude Turmes , you will secure a very substantial majority in favour of this report tomorrow and I would like to congratulate you here and now on that achievement .
But I am afraid , here on this occasion , that compromise has not been reached : in fact , we have heard some comments from his colleagues that suggest that some of his own group members , those with a more developed social conscience , are squirming and feeling rather uncomfortable with the approach that has been taken by the rapporteur .
We want more clarity ; in other words , we want to reduce the lack of clarity in the law so as to ensure the unhindered application of the principles contained in the European Union 's Treaties , and we want to honour the international agreements that we have concluded .
Our system of social care is also far from perfect .
As we are aware of the need to cut red tape and eliminate disparities between countries , we will indicate specific measures - such as setting up one - stop shops and the use of e-government - to try to speed up processes in this area .
There is that , and there is also the Treaty of Nice , and a Parliament with fewer seats and fewer powers , and a Commission with fewer commissioners .
It is hardly mentioned in this document .
Yes , Mr Dalli , you will have our support , but we experience that unease born of the risk associated with the distribution of competences between yourselves .
It appears that the world of crazy finance has not learnt from the crisis .
I welcome the clarity of this report also because it mentions matters which we generally avoid discussing for a variety of reasons .
This part underlines the key role of education , training , research and innovation , the importance of facilitating the establishment of the so - called knowledge triangle , and the need to support small and medium - sized enterprises , which quite often play a pioneering role in innovation .
We all know that there are some governments who are undermining the whole Schengen system through the mass regularisation of illegal aliens .
In closing I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their extremely pleasant and constructive cooperation on this report .
In this context , special attention must obviously be focused as well on the security of the travel documents issued by the third countries in question .
I therefore repeat with conviction that I fully support the directive .
As such , this regulation makes an important contribution towards better air quality , and hence to improving public health .
I call upon all EU institutions to avoid further delay in deciding on the macro - financial assistance for the Republic of Moldova .
The new CAP must enable people to enjoy an adequate supply of quality food , as well as being able to sustain the production of non - marketable public assets .
I truly hope that the writing of history and commemoration of the victims is the main focus in Ukraine and that this catastrophe is not manipulated for political purposes .
Most of these farms can use the sustainable model of agriculture for the good of farmers , the environment and of us all .
Online gambling accounts for just around 5 % of all the takings from gambling , but the sector is growing at an enormous rate .
In our democratic national systems , each time that there is a political discussion , even sometimes one that is very polarised , we do not call into question the very legitimacy of the State , while very often in Europe when those of us who are for Europe strongly express these objections , we have to confront those who are against Europe and who explore all sorts of populisms in order to damage our institutions and compromise this great project of peace and solidarity that is the European project .
( FR ) Madam President , firstly I should like to commend the Swedish Presidency 's efforts to reach an ambitious agreement in Copenhagen , despite the very strong wind of pessimism prevailing over these forthcoming negotiations .
But what can Westminster do as long as we are in the EU , because at exactly the same time , the European Commission wants all the powers over asylum seekers passed to them ?
These savings must benefit the new intermediary regions of course , but also the other regions .
This is not an emergency aid solidarity fund ; it is a fund which is based on reimbursement of specific costs for emergency operations after disasters , allowing for a return to normal living conditions .
Yes it did .
However , Europe has suffered from something else too .
With a view to CAP reform after 2013 , it will be necessary to tackle the matter with commitment and come up with measures necessary for limiting the impact of price volatility in the agricultural sector once and for all .
One thing is clear , however : this Europe will only be a good Europe if it is a democratic one .
For this reason , we place special emphasis on prevention ; this explains our Day for the Eradication of Poverty on 17 October , as Mrs Záborská has pointed out .
By September our fuel provision to the Gaza Strip had surpassed 90 million litres .
This is our moral obligation .
The Commission is financing CSFP joint actions establishing planning teams in Pristina .
In Greece , we are calling for the establishment of a Centre for Romani and Gypsy Studies , with special emphasis on culture .
The Commission certainly supports the country 's commitment to the consolidation of peace , stability and , above all , democracy .
To this end , we must fully utilise the technical means available to us in all bands to achieve the greatest possible efficiency .
I want to say that , in relation to the future , your comments are particularly welcome .
Developing countries must be supported to give them enough political room to manoeuvre so that speculation can be prevented and financial stability can be secured .
Madam President , I would like to point out that this is , of course , a worker - protection issue .
My own position remains unchanged : recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are comparable , under international law , with recognition of Kosovo .
14 .
Therefore , the way in which we pursue our energy policy and how we deal with those who we expect to invest in the projects is important .
The Member States should not always shift responsibility to the Commission but should also be prepared to take their own decisions .
Member of the Commission . - Do you mean these three questions on the CCCTB ?
Moreover , in exceptional cases , where this is specifically provided , this will be extended for a further12 months .
in writing . - The abolition of the death penalty worldwide is a priority of this Parliament and a particular priority of the Socialists and Democrats Group .
Thus , there are technical specifications for energy efficiency and environmental performance .
I am just thinking about the debate on the Professional Qualifications Directive , which we later also combined in a single instrument because this fragmentation was no longer manageable .
I hope that we will get the support of tomorrow 's plenary for our motion today and , above all , that it will encourage the Commission to get to work on this issue .
Rather , it is the best possible result today , as it fills a void and opens the way for further developments .
in writing . - ( SV ) The report 's starting point is increased interinstitutional cooperation by means of a general increase in services within the EU 's institutions .
Legislation on gender equality is harmonised , but greater effort needs to be made to implement it in order to reduce the differences between men and women in terms of their participation in the labour market , politics and the decision - making process , as well as with regard to access to education .
Early diagnosis and research provide a solid foundation for health protection .
It harms the Dutch economy and Dutch citizens .
The result , it is true , has taken a lot of work , many meetings and a commitment from us all , but I believe that we have succeeded in producing a good document .
The Albanian authorities bear the full responsibility for the efficient investigation of the facts and the equitable trial of those responsible .
It is almost beyond belief that in the EU in the 21st century , several hundred thousand people a year fall victim to human trafficking , most of them women and children .
in writing . - ( PL ) The latest two enlargements have resulted in a significant increase in the length of the European Union 's land and sea borders .
However , we also failed much closer to home , in our own territory .
The problem , which is starting to cause serious difficulties , lies in the imposition of a congestion charge .
We , the European Parliament , other EU institutions , the Member States have to understand that unless we care about young people today , it may be that none of our other strategies , including EU 2020 , are ever implemented , as there will not be anybody left to implement them .
As legislators confronted with that global backdrop , we need to do something .
It is therefore necessary for the statutory conditions for the industry to be cleared up as soon as possible .
I would also like to highlight the recognition given to traditional agriculture , particularly organic and small - scale farming , which exists in the more disadvantaged regions , and which represents not only an economic asset but , above all , an environmental asset , as it is essential for preserving biodiversity .
This is a de facto and de jure situation .
For example , it would make it easier for us to cooperate effectively in general terms if Russia implemented higher data protection standards ; research , education and culture also provide numerous opportunities for cooperation in the interests of our citizens , and should be taken into consideration in the new agreement .
I would add Greece ; you all know the problems it is facing .
The EU - US aviation markets , taken together , account for about 60 % of world air traffic .
This relates to special aid for establishing the public administration , strengthening civil society and for educational projects .
I think the Simpson report will be particularly popular due to the notion of tourism satellite accounts , namely , the adoption of pilot projects that will make it possible to assess the economic impact on individual sectors of the economy , in other words , aspects relating to same - day visits , the evaluation report to be drawn up every five years and the possibility , indeed the necessity , of a five - yearly report to assess the effects of statistics .
Our response to this phenomenon through the European Union 's Solidarity Fund provides important support in the task of rebuilding the areas affected by disasters , along with reducing their potential cross - border effects .
It has often been said in the past that the strategy of cooperation that characterised the Lisbon Strategy failed .
EC - Pacific States Interim Partnership Agreement ( vote )
However , Parliament is also passing up an opportunity with the Garriga Polledo report .
They have to export their goods .
It will then also be possible to check whether any of the individual legislative regimes that we are removing from circulation are to be incorporated .
The international community , and above all the European Union , must force Israel and the Palestinians to reach an amicable settlement .
Russia is planning to build two new nuclear power plants even closer to the European Union 's borders in Belarus and Kaliningrad .
Only then will we be able to reduce the need for resources and the amount of items going to landfill .
A draft recommendation constitutes a finding of maladministration by the Ombudsman .
This is a disgrace .
in writing . - ( FR ) I welcome the adoption of this report , which presents a balanced and realistic view of the issue of immigration and has achieved a broad consensus , as the rapporteur hoped .

( The sitting was suspended at 12.55 and resumed at 15.00 )
Women also perform the lower skilled jobs .

The aims laid out in the institute 's work programme should particularly help implement the indicators set out in Beijing .
I look forward to continuing my cooperation and dialogue with Parliament , both in this area and other areas of trade policy .
What we have to do is reach agreement .

The EU 's accession to the European Convention will mean that the protection of fundamental rights will be supplemented and strengthened , that citizens in our Member States will have better protection in relation to the EU 's activities and that legal practice in the area of human rights will be harmonised better in the two European courts , in The Hague and Strasbourg .

on behalf of the S&D Group . - Madam President , when it comes to the issue of meat imports , we in Europe must nail down the principles which form our policy on this , and have a strong but fair system of regulation .

However , the Commission is also actively participating in the short - term , urgent , essential measures that are part of the conclusions of the Ecofin Council yesterday , including a commitment to improve deposit guarantee schemes , which are seriously affected , not by the insecurity of deposits in financial institutions , but by some unilateral initiatives with negative impacts for other countries .

I would like to conclude , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , by reminding you of the high financial cost of implementing this regulation , which is between EUR 10 and 25 million per year in an initial estimate made for the Union of 25 , which leads us to recommend that the Member States should be given sufficient flexibility in applying this regulation .
I was entirely convinced that it was very good news that France was to take on the responsibility of the Presidency of the Council during this particularly difficult period .
It is part of the process . It was the starting point for this attempt , after the Constitutional Treaty , to get the Reform Treaty in place .
The negotiations were both lengthy and difficult , but in the end , our discussions led to an endorsement by the European Council of the Commission 's estimate of EUR 100 billion annually by 2020 , and it estimated that the level of international public support should lie in the range of EUR 22 billion to EUR 50 billion by the same year .
It is important not to avoid this debate but equally important not to decide too hastily .
I supported the report presented by Mrs Giannakou , which proposes , in particular , that political parties and European foundations have a legal personality of their own , with the establishment of a common legal and fiscal status based in EU law .
I do agree with you that we have actually been under - prioritising our development aid in the agricultural sector for decades .
I welcomed the document because the EU and Canada have a close relationship as far as trade and foreign direct investment are concerned .
Within that agreement , the value is of the following order : the gains in the developing countries would be of the order of EUR 12-14 billion annually ; there would be new access to emerging markets in emerging countries , such as China ; we would have the opportunity in the European Union for new exports , diversified in new ways - for example , in chemicals and textiles - and in services there is a potential for EUR 14 billion of trade .

Some colleagues have said that countries should deal with problems that arise individually and that there is no need for so much coordination here .
We will not give up until equal competitive conditions have been established .

The Commission estimates that around 7 000 injuries and 600 lives could be saved every year if the measures proposed in this draft legislative instrument were applied .

I hope that we will also be able to agree about the importance of cooperation on political strategies and instruments for international adoptions .
The mission of observing the elections in the Republic of Moldova is necessary and opportune , but the monitoring should start focusing on the period prior to the future elections , taking into consideration the need to correct the serious infringements of freedom of the press by the Chisinau communist regime , the repeated breaches of judicial independence and the recent amendments to the electoral law by the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova , dominated by the Communist Party .

Action taken on Parliament 's positions and resolutions : see Minutes

Yesterday , Mr Schulz made a lengthy political statement without referring to the rule under which he was speaking .
In the area of legislative measures , the Czech Presidency managed to achieve a consensus within the framework of the recovery plan over the possibility of applying reduced VAT rates for labour - intensive locally - provided services .
From the perspective of my group , I would like to underline that that is the crucial test that the Commission has to live up to and we need to contribute to because , if so , we can all contribute to Europe with more and better innovations .
Firstly , let me say that the Lisbon Treaty is not a train wreck and it is nonsense to be saying that .

We should clearly recognise that it remains an American problem in which we could prove helpful , if only for the fact that human rights are paramount to us .

How does the Commission view this problem and what measures would it propose we take ?
The EU must put in place the basic conditions needed to safeguard the future of our farmers so that they can stay competitive internationally and their businesses can remain economically viable , despite the fact that we have the strictest animal welfare standards in the world .
We should categorically reject such hidden tactics here and now , because we have successful transaction taxes even at a national level and these transaction taxes work in sub - markets .
Nevertheless , there is no doubt that much remains to be done in this respect , and that the European Union and the Russian Federation not only share a historical , cultural and religious heritage , but that they also have common interests and challenges which warrant a closer relationship on many levels .
A constituent of mine recently returned from a holiday in another EU country .
In addition , incentives for energy efficiency are laid down as well as , albeit with no purpose specification , an obligation on the part of Member States to invest at least half of the revenues in developing countries and new technologies .

Since the drop in aggregate demand will affect the implementation of the budget by Greece and Ireland in 2011 , the ECB will then come and tell us that the austerity policy was right , but that it did not go far enough or deep enough .
It is about all of us , what we have achieved together at the European Parliament in the last 15 months , and what is ahead of us .
Again , additional funding for a price monitoring system on fish prices will be made available by the budgetary authorities by September .
What we do not need is carelessness or any turning of a blind eye by those who are responsible for monitoring .
It is what the societies of those countries expect , and it is what they deserve .
I would like to draw attention to the importance of reforming the Ecolabel scheme and to the need to simplify the system by reducing the administrative burdens involved in using the label and extending the range of the product categories participating in the scheme .
A ban on this kind of weapon must be implemented globally , through the UN and on the initiative of the nation states , not by the European Parliament .
Our consumers and our farmers deserve clarification .
Our involvement in Zimbabwe is well known , but we should continue to mention it , again and again , precisely because of people like Abel Chikomo .
Those responsible should not complain if this fear of citizens again goes against official Europe in the subsequent European elections .

This is ridiculous .
I do not think it can be left in the hands of the Parliament 's services to determine which amendments relate to the Treaty of Lisbon and which do not .
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , which represents centre and liberal parties in the European Parliament , has so far been the only one of Parliament 's political groups to say that Strasbourg should stop being used .

I favour this choice by the Commission from a legislative excellence point of view , although I believe that the Member States should be given sufficient time to analyse the possible consequences within the context of a broader review of the basic legal instrument in this area , namely the Directive relating to measuring instruments ( Directive 2004/22 / EC ) .
Those two examples have been cases in point .
The summit will take place in the second half of 2008 .

Secondly : work has to be paid work .
The weakness of Ukraine 's constitutional framework has also contributed to this .
In practice , this is not efficient and has led to situations were disputes remained unresolved , as they could easily be blocked by the ' injuring ' party .
The three - year reform of the Financial Regulation will enable us to establish the legal basis for this simplification , but I do not think that tinkering with the tolerable risk of error is the right way to go .

( NL ) Madam President , this is the third year of our financial perspectives and it is also the third year that we have gathered here to talk about their intermediate adjustment .
Primary industries and power generation require many years of investment and concentration of capital , which means they need to be subsidised .
We need a special programme here .

It is correct that volatility in foreign exchange markets has increased in recent weeks , with significant shifts in the value of major bilateral exchange rates .
Our aim is to adopt the proposal for a directive during the first quarter of 2011 .
I think that this piece of legislation will bode well during the current economic crisis because the European economy needs cohesion and its biggest driving force , SMEs .
Both countries have met all the criteria .
All of this leads to mounting unemployment and problems for small and medium - sized enterprises and , in my opinion , we should perhaps focus on fewer issues in the future while ensuring that those issues we do focus on are implemented in full .

( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning is a decisive document to enable the national and sectoral reference frameworks of qualifications to be compared at European level .
I agree with Mrs Wallis 's point that a call for a 50 - year moratorium on any exploitation is neither practical nor reasonable , but I think a limited moratorium on new exploitation - pending fresh scientific studies - is something all civilised nations could perhaps agree to .
I add my voice to the appeal by international humanitarian organisations to prevent the enormous number of children orphaned as a result of the earthquake becoming victims of human traffickers .
However , your predecessor did not act fairly in allowing many Members to overrun by half a minute or 20 seconds - the Commissioner also spoke for seven minutes and 36 seconds instead of three minutes .

As the gravity of the situation has increased , we have also acted as a ' facilitator ' as far as deliveries of gas to the Community were concerned - a role that was very much appreciated by both parties , because they were not talking to each other at all .
This is due to the fact that the Council has to deal with other matters as well .
For example , if countries like Qatar , whose per capita income is higher than that of 25 Member States of the European Union , are included in the GSP system , I am certain that we need to take a very critical look at this when reviewing the whole system .
Not only that , but married couples of the same sex should be able to move freely around Europe and have their partnership legally recognised wherever they are .

I wonder , would the Commission consider only funding , from a safety and interoperable point of view , rail systems that are operated electrically , and phase out over a period of time diesel - guzzling locomotives - I know in my own country all the rail systems are operated thus - and set a target date to have safe , interconnected and environmentally friendly rail systems across the entire European Union ?
I am particularly happy to see that those killers we know as bull bars will now have to pass the same performance tests on the vehicles on which they are intended to be installed , although for me the campaign to ban bull bars outright still goes on .
Security of energy supply is an important element of general security .
It is like a supply of oxygen and it has helped significantly to ensure that there have as yet been no mass redundancies among the major manufacturers in Europe and that they have been able to retain their workforces .
Mrs Oomen - Ruijten has asked for the floor .
in writing . - As I understood , this report deals with international investment treaties .
Large parts of the report - which was voted through in plenary - are very sound , however , and my ' no ' vote should not be interpreted as an unwillingness to participate in the work on Policy Coherence for Development .

( FI ) Madam President , I think this resolution is fine but slightly inconsistent as you get the impression in some places that one is , as it were , surrendering to terrorism .
Despite the exceptionally technical nature of this proposed regulation , its value to Europe and the Member States should not be underestimated .
It is therefore necessary for us to have a cohesive and active policy - not only to save the jobs that it is possible to save , but also to help those who become unemployed to get back into the labour market .
At last we can now humanise capitalism !
Let us not wake up to find that we are pushed away from the political and economic stage , which has been taken by another actor , or even being accused of passivity , lack of political vision and inability to resolve the conflicts in our neighbourhood .

Regarding Africa 's development , I believe that there is so much work to do on this continent and that China , as a new player , should be welcome to participate .
This is part of the Thessaloniki Agenda and a cornerstone of our integration policy for the Western Balkans .
But the second point with regard to what this directive is doing - and possibly the most important of all - is that for the first time it recognises the contribution of session musicians by establishing a fund to allow them to ensure that they have a return and remuneration for their work - which has been exploited by people over a long period of time - for which they may only get a one - off payment if they are lucky .
Citizens need to be placed at the heart of the Single Market .
I am pleased that the procedure for obtaining this permit has been simplified through a one - stop shop system , which will ease administrative procedures for foreign workers .
- ( PL ) Mr President , the Posting of Workers Directive is one of the foundations on which the practical implementation of one of the four basic Community freedoms , which are European freedoms , is based and which has accompanied treaties and the European Community right from the start .

( FR ) Madam President , this debate got off to a bad start , with the good guys , the anti - nuclear people , on one side , and the bad guys , those who still support nuclear power , on the other .
Passengers are also concerned that different airlines behave differently towards passengers , and to always obtain compensation from these airlines through the courts is not the easiest thing .
We firmly believe in the importance of sending out a message of hope to citizens as regards the gloomier aspects , and we should therefore encourage you to reinforce those EMSA mechanisms which proved to be useful precautionary , and then protective , measures for the coastline , to press ahead with this third maritime safety package and , in particular , to improve cooperation between ports , which was perhaps not always as good as it might have been , and certainly to present all those aspects relating to improving the quality of marine fuel , a proposal which was agreed recently by the IMO and will certainly improve the outcome or consequences of this type of incident .
I especially look to Commissioner Verheugen on this .
In the case of large - scale offences , the International Criminal Court must play an important role and establish a close correlation with the decisions made by national courts .
I believe that this initiative will serve as a spur to Member States to draw up prompt payment codes .
This law seems to have been drafted under the political influence of Horthy , Kádár , Antonescu or Ceauşescu .
To achieve these goals , we need to mobilise the Flexibility Instrument to the value of EUR 105 million .
Lastly , I believe that the Commission should take account of the concerns expressed by the various associations in the sector , so as to ensure transparent and fair negotiations that do not harm the European economy .

I declare that my name is Panayotopoulos and that I submitted a question about paragraph 6 of the framework for negotiations with Turkey .
If there is anything that the recent financial turbulence has shown us , it is the benefit of a strong central bank that can withstand short - term solutions , not to mention the stabilising effect of participating in a large currency zone .

Our economic partnership is a key driver of global economic prosperity and represents the largest , most integrated and longest lasting economic relationship in the world .
I am certain that my country would be a good host for the Institute because of the government 's commitment to research and innovation / development , because of the country 's research infrastructure , because of Hungary 's early role in the advancement of science , and not least because of Hungary 's hospitality .
Moreover , as Mr Le Foll said at the start of his speech , we should consider implementing mechanisms for regulating the markets as part of the common agricultural policy post - 2013 .
In the past years , we have seen political instability , characterised by competition between the President and Prime Minister , exacerbated by a lack of clarity in the Constitution .

The population of the Gaza Strip have only 60 % of their daily food needs available , which means that they are even more at risk of disease and exposed to difficult conditions .

author . - Mr President , I think all of us would want to express our condolences to the family and friends of Salmaan Taseer , the Governor of Punjab put in place by the government of Pakistan , and we are remembering here today his clear support for Asia Bibi - a position he knew to be controversial and indeed dangerous .
The example of Italy is fresh in our minds .
As always ( as before ) , greater attention should also be devoted to regions lagging behind .
( ES ) Atlético Madrid , its fans and even the Spanish police are being mistreated by the Union of European Football Associations .
Statement by the President
Considering the challenges posed by climate change , our high dependency on fossil fuels and the growing challenge of creating rural jobs , the European Union needs a clear , easy - to - follow regulatory system enabling it to operate effectively as regards renewable energy production , and especially as regards biomass production .
Thirdly , humanising the debate about the victims , who are people who are suffering and need to be protected , defended , recognised , helped and supported .
I should also like to express my wish that our Irish friends propose a road map to the European Council that is at once realistic and ambitious and provides a timetable for ending the institutional impasse .
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank those MEPs who have voiced their initial reactions .
In this report we therefore call for auctioning of emission permits , we demand an emissions cap which is consistent with the reduction target of 30 % , and restrictions and tough requirements for the use of flexible mechanisms .
Hence our proposal to reject this directive .
Above all , our message must be clear and must be contained in a simple , understandable , comprehensible procedure which , if nothing else , functions for everyone , functions for the citizens , functions for Parliament , for the Union 's institutions , for the Member States and for all stakeholders in the procedure .
I wanted to raise another issue , however , I recalled during the discussion when Mrs Ferrero - Waldner visited the Israeli Government during the terrible bloodshed of the Gaza war .
The war in Bosnia destroyed more than 75 % of the country , caused the death of more than 200 000 people and resulted in 1.8 million refugees .
Mr President , the opinion that the European Parliament will vote now on the Commission 's proposal for a directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation does not prejudice the final position that the Parliament will take with regard to the implementation of Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the consequences for the procedures based on Council Decision 1999/468 / EC of 28 June 1999 , especially as regards the regulatory procedure with scrutiny or the position that the Parliament may wish to take on delegated acts in other legislation .
These proposals aim to supplement this compromise on the most sensitive issues such as : liberalisation of planting rights ; grubbing - up of vines ; addition of sugar and must aid ; maintenance of potable alcohol , which is so important for some prestige wines such as port , the competitiveness of which must be guaranteed ; crisis prevention ; promotion and so on .
The truth , then , is that the Council has handed yet more powers over to the EU , including powers over the UK economy , which is the single most important issue to the British people today .
With regard to the fight against direct or indirect discrimination on the basis of gender , that policy has proved a complete success in the European Union .
( DE ) Mr President , the report contains good innovations .
In employment terms , the jobs of around 100 000 miners could be at stake ; they may be unable to find jobs in other sectors as quickly as is necessary and they run the risk of becoming long - term unemployed .
All these measures , together with Member States acting in a coordinated and consistent manner , will show a European Union addressing the real problems .
The current Romanian Government has stipulated that this is a zero priority measure and the facilities which have been approved mean that this priority is already guaranteed .
We therefore hope , as I have said , that this work will be concluded , that the report will be published and that any recommendations made by this Troika will also be made known to us .
The fact that Cameroon is Africa 's leading exporter of hardwood to Europe makes it necessary to regulate the flow of goods through the partnership agreement on which we are voting today .
It was also interesting to see how Mr Kirkhope turned in his seat , because the Tories are so close to this peculiar party in their views on European policy .
After the Second World War , when Europe slowly came to accept that the independence of African countries was eventually inevitable , Kenya was emphatically excluded , as was the country we now know as Zimbabwe .
We do have those institutions now , within and outside the European Union - a small number of institutions that can cooperate together .
This report proposes greater civilian - military cooperation in terms of pooling efforts for CBRN disaster prevention , detection , preparation and response .
In order for there to be proper vertical and horizontal cooperation , procedures must be streamlined , and more money spent on the training of specialists from implementing bodies in the individual Member States .
The student scene is fairly lively .
The study on volunteering in sport : a very important topic .
Delivery will require a collective effort by all stakeholders at all levels .
We are only meant to have two minutes .
President - in - Office of the Council . - ( FR ) I will be perfectly frank with Mr Ó Neachtain : given the items which will already be on the agenda for the European Council in December , I do not think that this question will be raised at the European Council , despite the challenge which it represents .
This is a very exciting subject which I believe we do not talk about enough these days .
That is the inherent position , which is why we are rejecting the compromise .
That is the reality in Europe .
Secondly , the Trade and Cooperation Agreement must be used as a very useful instrument to encourage internal reforms that bring Iraq closer to multilateral system disciplines .
Cohesion policy is the second pillar on which this growth must rely , a sustainable , intelligent and inclusive growth .
( FR ) Mr President , I would simply like to ask Mr Gollnisch what he believes the outcome of the election signifies and whether it means that Mr Ouattara 's victory must ultimately result in him taking power .
Only when Member States show true solidarity will there be a comprehensive common security and defence policy .
We are far too dependent on third countries for our feed and need to begin cultivating more ourselves .
When that happens , we must preserve the rule of law .
We will keep on being in the lead .
For this very reason , this proposal aims to provide the Member States with a legal framework enabling them to more effectively resolve the potential negative effects of mine closures that could occur as a result of the gradual withdrawal of subsidies , in particular , the social and environmental effects .
You will not solve the crucial problems facing Europe through your legal subterfuges or by letting yourselves be guided by the judgments of the European Court of Justice .
I would stress that we are talking about international waters here and that Lene Espersen , the Danish Foreign Minister , has also emphatically said that this is unacceptable .
What is more , the technology used by electric vehicles is the most efficient and best for the environment .
( FR ) Mr President , as far as the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance is concerned , cohesion policy is at the heart of one of the most fundamental policies of the European Union : solidarity .
To this end , within the framework of the 2009 call for proposals , EUR 250 million was allocated for the ERTMS , part of which will be used specifically to update the relevant computer programs .
I noticed very carefully how it was done .
However , I would like to emphasise that this will not end the debate on the future of the dairy sector in the European Union .
What I have presented represents , in my view , the limits of flexibility in addressing the short - term crisis , with a view to putting in place a medium - and longer - term perspective of restructuring , in order to regain sustainability of resources and the profitability of the sector .
I think that quotas will not solve the problem of the lack of women scientists if women themselves do not wish to change this status quo .
I cannot go to all of them .
( ES ) Madam President , in the current crisis situation , the laudable efforts of the French Presidency and the Industry Commissioner , Mr Verheugen , should be congratulated .
The Union 's financial help reflects the strategic importance of Ukraine as a potential candidate for EU membership .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , honourable Members , you asked me to come to the plenary to explain where we are in the negotiations on ACTA - the international Anti - Counterfeiting Trade Agreement .
In these times of crisis , one cannot ' play ' with European taxpayers ' money for the sake of politically sensitive issues .
The agreement states that Europe will develop its own system for the collection and sorting of bank details .
However , Chinese authorities have not heeded international calls to stop pursuing their follow - up to the riots of 14 March 2008 in Tibet .
Before suspending the sitting for a couple of minutes until the arrival of our guests , I wish to welcome a delegation from the Syrian Parliament , led by Mr Suleiman Haddad , Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Syrian People 's Assembly , which is here as part of our 10th EP / Syria Interparliamentary Meeting .
Despite this , I have voted against the resolution , because we received it yesterday as a finished text and were not able to debate it seriously and because the devil is in the detail .
I want to keep the tried and tested Community method - with the Commission as guardian and judge of common European interests - from which the exclusive right of legislative initiative stems .
Ten years on , we still have a lot to do .
Ladies and gentlemen , on 13 April Ennaama Asfari , a human rights defender in the Western Sahara , was arrested in Marrakech .
This debate showed up many national differences , and there was no honesty in the debate at all .
We know who they are .
Yet , like it or not , it is the responsibility of the EU and the 27 Member States to take action , bearing in mind the overriding priority of international solidarity and the protection of human rights .
We are sceptical about these proposals .
The discussion that has taken place to date has involved the trade unions far too little , and NGOs and churches have been similarly excluded .
Finally , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur .
However , you were the one who had to take on this Presidency , and I congratulate you and all the ministers of the present government .
At present large volumes of young cod that have just arrived in the Baltic Sea are being dumped .
As early as 1998 , when the EJN was established , a secure telecommunications network was envisaged , but it has been impossible , so far , to agree on the modalities , apparently on grounds of cost .
I also welcome the fact that the legislator has allowed the Member States to include provisions that are more favourable to consumers in their respective national legal systems .
( The President cut off the speaker )
There is no stability without solidarity .
As far as I see it , the main merit of the resolution on health care systems in sub - Saharan Africa and global health is that it tackles the issue on the basis of the specific features of the region in question .
Therefore , as highlighted in your resolution , this semester will be crucial for Croatia 's negotiating process .
The purpose of this is to construct a scheme to create billions , fantasy financial assets at the service of a system that appears to have learnt nothing from the crisis in which it is currently embroiled .
Turning now to regions where healthcare is cheap and to those where waiting times are short . Eventually , they will have so many health tourists coming in that their own local patients will be squeezed out .
These two European citizens are acting on our behalf , too ; they are acting to make up for our political failure .
In this context , we must also examine the measures required to ensure that the European banking system can finance the European economy , especially small and medium - sized enterprises .
You should read the agreement !
I would like to end by reiterating the position which I also expressed during the January plenary , namely , that dialogue on human rights is an instrument which has proved to be ineffective and inadequate .
I therefore think that consideration really should be given to this and I welcome the fact that the Commission is thinking about amending the provisions of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1/2003 in this area with regard to criteria and other types of sanctions , making the provisions more specific and laying down tougher criteria including in relation to the penalty measures to be laid down .
There are technologies that do meet all of these requirements , meaning that x - rays , radiographs and naked images must be outmoded , which is where we are going wrong at the moment .
We are especially interested in promoting and analysing its link with European associations for innovation within the EU framework for innovation .
The chances of getting money back in this way are negligible .
This will really help increase consumers ' rights and therefore also help us move towards completion of the single market .
The proposal to remove the requirement of disclosing formation expenses also seems justified .
Let us not forget that the Member States were not unanimous on this agreement either .
Many fellow Members have emphasised that the continuation of such differences is unacceptable from the perspective of equal rights .
President - in - Office , tell me how on earth I can tell 500 million European citizens that we are selling out on important safeguards and principles just because we are not able to put our foot down , because Council is not able to get its act together .
Now Mrs Wortmann - Kool , who has left , spoke about the obstacles to the internal market and Mr Jarzembowski , despite his report on the greening of transport , also expressed reservations about the Eurovignette .
Although social protection falls under the competence of the Member States , the lack of harmonisation is clearly damaging the Internal Market .
I agree with the assessment that public procurement , as a highly important part of the European market , should remain a tool for promoting environmentally friendly vehicles , but this should not be done in a mechanical way .
We should respond as Europeans .
Finally , I should like to point out that creating this new category will not involve any additional expenditure , thanks to the savings expected by several regions no longer being under Objective 1 .
Things have been done .
I wish to end by saying that the European Parliament will be a permanent partner in the process of developing and implementing the EU Strategy for the Danube Region .
I would like to observe that cohesion policy is not very visible in rural areas , despite the declarations which have been made on this matter .
The latest results show we are on the right track but that , if we take account of the effect of debt cancellation in certain countries , the current good results are quite relative .
Another source of concern is the current military offensive against the Karen populations in the east of the country , where the biggest military operation in a decade has taken place .
That shows things have progressed , there is a greater awareness .
This is an extremely important issue which goes to the heart of the Member States ' sovereignty and also the ownership and management of the right to exploit a natural resource , in other words the transfer to private interests of rights to exploit a public asset .
All I can say to you is that our intention is entirely the opposite .
Social reality stocktaking ( debate )
Gender - related violence , whether committed in the home or armed conflict zones , is one of the most serious human rights violations and must be opposed and punished accordingly .
In addition , artistic activity can be useful for technological research and development and in turn is influenced by it .
The next item is the joint debate on
These should include a requirement for greater media freedom .
I think your proposals are a move in the right direction .
This would fulfil all the strategic and economic requirements contained in Decision 1364/2006 / EC .
A well - functioning system for standard - setting is vital for the European economy as a whole and , in particular , for the information and communication technology sector .
Then , and only then , would we have the money available to help the poorer regions around the Black Sea .
For our group , the basic point here is the balance between security and freedom .
However , as regards other matters , I think that we will make progress in the ongoing talks .
You have failed to say it again today .
The ERI will be used for the experimental study , mainly using inductive methods , of phenomena in the world around us , with the aim of producing practical solutions .
By SADC standards , even the parliamentary elections of 29 March were neither free nor fair .
The procedures must protect consumers from the danger of unhealthy food and from being misled .
One possible route is self - regulation , by which I mean that the producers of mobile phones and hence of chargers can agree very swiftly to impose a standard that puts an end to this truly ridiculous and damaging situation .
Not only that , but it is also detrimental , not only for our country - my country - but also for the other countries of the Union .
We are talking here about the road haulage sector , a sector that has made it possible to achieve a 40 % rise in economic exchange between the EU Member States in the last five years .
If you want a fundamental change , you need to put forward an integrated plan for all means of transport - and that is something we made very clear in the committee .
The fact is , people are already getting used to the situation .
I would like to call on Mrs Geoghegan - Quinn to evaluate the study which is being drawn up very carefully .
Is it the lack of prospects , or the general insecurity surrounding the profession ?
( FR ) Mr President , for the last time , is Mr Madlener aware , when he argues against European solidarity and against Greece , that , after Germany , the Netherlands is the second largest beneficiary of the European internal market and that practically one out of every two jobs in the Netherlands is linked to activities relating to the export of goods and services to the European Union ?
Nuclear power is a source of energy which we cannot give up just like that , because it provides a large part of our energy and contributes to our reduction in CO 2 emissions .
Why are there double standards ?
It would be good , and we would have enough time , if this were not the external reality .
It is too premature to speculate about the names yet .
I share the Commission 's opinion on the need for coordinated efforts and for linking the short - term commitments and efforts with the long - term commitments .
Systematic and rigorous monitoring of the compatibility of European legislation with the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be guaranteed .
Whilst the progress made in the area of gender equality is unquestionable , major challenges remain .
An Africa that is at ease , courted by multiple partners offering for the first time , and indeed the first time in a long while , promising perspectives for growth , will clearly wish to be treated as an equal .
The law on the use of special intelligence lays down a purpose limitation , stipulating that these measures can only be used for the purpose of fighting organised crime or for protecting national security .
And , even in those countries that chose the CCCTB , no companies would be forced to use it , because there would be no sense in forcing companies that are not operating in the internal market - that are not doing business in the internal market - to use this common tax base .
And we have heard their plans this week : how they are going to cut public services and to increase pension ages , and how they will help the wealthy by cutting inheritance tax . Once again they are fighting like rats in a sack , as we say in the UK , over Europe .
Vice - President of the Commission . - Mr President , I start my concluding remarks by thanking once again Mrs Giannakou for her report because I think that this debate has very clearly proven that the concern and the issues she raised in her report are legitimate ; they are at the heart of European integration and of its democratic nature .
( Applause )
If they did n't see it as a benefit , would they just not pay the contributions - after all , no one really knows she is helping her husband - and is this not what married people do , help each other ?
During the autumn , the Presidency also organised a conference in Brussels on victims of people - trafficking , with the aim of highlighting the need for measures to be taken for those affected and the focus on cooperation with countries of origin for human trafficking .
In tackling the issue of fundamental rights in the EU today we must not , however , omit to refer to the terrible events in Gaza .
( SV ) Mr President , it is the task of the European Court of Justice to issue judgments in line with the Treaties .
I met the Belarusian Ambassador in London , who reassured me that this time it would all be different , that it would be up to international standards , and that the OSCE would be able to say that it was fair and free .
It is always the children who suffer most .
This is the reason why I am asking the Commission to deal with this matter with maximum accountability and present a vision for drafting an innovation action plan for the future .
Regarding that as an essential criterion , together with the corresponding controls , will also lead to success .
It is true that a major step was taken with the appointment , under the Lisbon Treaty , of an EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs .
( CS ) The history of the enlargement of the Schengen area is marked by double standards .
I have reservations about the proposal that sanctions against producers who fail to reduce the CO 2 emissions of vans should be higher than sanctions for failing to reduce emissions from cars .
There are numerous benefits to this .
Hence my support for the points contained in the report , namely : that there should be clear definitions relating not only to the scope , but also to the different actors in the supply chain , in order to clarify their roles and responsibilities ; that sanctions should be equivalent to those applied for illegal acts involving narcotics ; and that there should be enhanced transparency and regulation of medicine sales on the Internet , thereby enabling consumers to distinguish between illegal operators and online pharmacies .
The penalties vary with regard to their type and category of seriousness and with regard to the level of fines .
But negotiations on our common steps at expert level are , to date , not finished .
( DE ) Mr President , in two days ' time , we will be debating the question of body scanners .
Furthermore , men and women who stay home for long periods of time to take care of the elderly or young children often lose out economically because they do n't have an income and their work is not factored into the GDP even though it is important work .
The ratio of clearance to new forest growth is even higher than 100 % .
The proposal is to maintain the supply of this product , which is used for local consumption in small quantities of 800 tonnes per year .
I hope that further , similar steps will allow us to unblock negotiations on the proposal and proceed with its adoption .
I think we should be adamant about that .
All that was needed in plenary , therefore , was to ratify a consensual decision .
Particularly during economically uncertain times , it is important to be able to rely on commitments made in this regard .
Finally , we must take into account the imbalances produced in the marketing chain , the importance of relying on sectoral marketing standards and the need to draw up EU guidelines for best practice for the operation of the systems related to agricultural product quality and their mutual recognition .
Recognising the specific challenges that await us in 2009 , we cannot at the same time exempt ourselves from the duty of frugal management of European taxpayers ' money , i.e. from certain self - imposed restrictions which we shall also expect from other European institutions .
It is significant that in the exceptionally fragmented and often contradictory Hungarian political arena a sweeping majority voted in favour of ratification .
It is impossible not to sympathise with the emotion felt by this Mother Courage at the sight of these people , oppressed and humiliated to an intolerable degree , forcing their way through the blockade imposed by Israel and finally breathing fresh air , with time to find milk for the children , food for the family and a little happiness to bolster their morale .
It will benefit fellow Members here in Parliament who receive extortionate fines for expressing their opinions freely and who have nowhere to go to appeal against this .
The border protection agency Frontex plays an important role when it comes to combating illegal immigration .
The low turn - out at the EU elections speaks volumes .
Requiring Member Sates to accept electronically submitted VAT returns will also significantly simplify the process .
Without our support , this small agricultural holding could not stay in existence .
It is important to remember this .
These processes make it all the more urgent to create a common European energy policy based on solidarity .
Lastly , Israel is not a special case .
As far as you are concerned , the Spanish Presidency and the Commission have violated the Treaty of Lisbon because the European Parliament has been left out .
The people who live on the islands in this part of the Indian Ocean are very poor , face the problem of unemployment and , as the rapporteur himself writes , are , in practice , dependent on financial help from abroad .
On 20 December , it will have its visa requirement lifted and , a short while ago , we had elections in Greece .
Yet the uncertainty being created at the moment by the confidentiality of the negotiating documents has given rise to many rumours .
Why not ?
I am saying what I think : this directive is also from another era , from before the crisis .
Presentation of the programme of the Spanish Presidency ( continuation of debate )
The men with clipboards and the statistical spies from Eurostat want more data and - let us be honest - you want this data to tax and control , which explains your thirst for ever more statistics .
In 2011 - this much is already clear - the areas where we will have the largest expenditure - including for this service - particularly in the administration lines , are the areas where we have the least amount of leeway .
We also urgently need to consider innovative financing mechanisms , such as a tax on financial transactions , which would make a significant contribution to financing the EU budget .
However , in order for this economy to be strong , the common agricultural policy needs to be supported and strengthened , while at the same time , of course , it has to be taken into account that the technical and social situation needs to change , and soon .
We need limits for food from Japan .
It is therefore highly unfortunate that Peter Mandelson , our most competent Commission member , is leaving his post as Commissioner responsible for the EU 's trade policy .
The amendments made will help create a hostile environment for traffickers , protect victims and prevent this activity more effectively because fundamental rights must be respected .
Nevertheless , day after day we Members of Parliament discuss this culture shift , this climate change that affects our economies , that forces us to give up our economic dependence on fossil fuels and switch to other energy sources .
It would be a backward step to put this situation in jeopardy ; instead , we should concentrate on improving the transposition of the framework decision , especially in terms of protecting fundamental rights .
At the same time , however , as an MEP , I cannot but agree with Mrs Pack and Mrs Bildt that true European solidarity involves the European Union providing logistical help in meeting criteria rather than deviating from them , as this has a demoralising effect on societies and absolves governments of responsibility .
He allowed five extremely crucial years to pass by .
I had the honour of meeting him on a visit to Venezuela .
It is indeed essential that we see that these two problems have to be resolved in parallel ; financial repair must be accelerated , banks restructured and , if need be , recapitalised as soon as possible .
The Prime Minister of Kosovo has recently stated that the declaration of independence is a matter of days away .
In particular , the directive proposes to withdraw bank secrecy in the relations between Member States for administrative cooperation purposes .
We must reinforce solidarity among the Member States and equip ourselves with the appropriate resources to effectively control the external borders .
One of the aims in revising this directive is to organise , in these conditions , an internal market in UCITS which really works .
Mr President , Mr Barroso , you have answered my questions with your inimitable diplomacy , but I do not want to let you get away with this .
A long - term framework is important , but a seven - year freeze with rigid budget ceilings both overall and by sector is an unreasonable model in today 's rapidly changing world .
Through cooperation between the various EU educational establishments , Erasmus Mundus II will improve the response to the growing demand for student mobility and will promote the quality of higher education in the EU and dialogue between different cultures .
For this reason the vote secured in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is already a remarkable political result .
I think that , in terms of energy policy , we need , to a certain extent , to move away from the debate of the past , which sought to achieve something with simple figures , binding targets and miracle solutions , because we have clearly not achieved enough .
They therefore need to be protected from unfair competition from third countries .
It is a primary obligation to investigate and prosecute those who commit war crimes , genocide and crimes against humanity .
The Dublin Regulation shall be amended in such a way as to allow the suspension of transfers to those Member States that are undergoing particular pressure .
The large proportion of residents having dual citizenship creates additional differences in respect of rights as well , and so we have to make every effort to abolish these differences and to provide a visa - free regime for all Moldovans .
Consequently , I wonder why alignment with the most protective rules is being rejected for these people in difficulty .
I voted for this report because I believe that it is vitally important for us to establish trade links which comply with competition principles not only with Korea , but also with the other countries outside the EU .
( CS ) Madam President , in my opinion , there is no dispute over the fact that subsidies to particular segments of the economy distort and destroy economic competition , and that State aid is therefore damaging to the healthy functioning of the market , not only in the short term but also in the long term .
This is completely unacceptable , and I therefore welcome this report , aimed at giving the spouses significant responsibilities , above all in terms of enlightened choice , choice of jurisdiction and finally choice of applicable law .
We also ought to urge Russia to take a more active part in international negotiations , as it is the eve of the Copenhagen conference .
This is necessary to be able to pursue the policy effectively .
The final Commission position will take account of the latest scientific information on the stock and of the outcome of the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna which took place in November last year .
This report is merely a long list of proposals and recommendations aimed at the Member States so that they grant to the hundreds of thousands of people who each year enter their territory legally or illegally rights that are not only equal to those of their nationals , but also more numerous and effective .
I must also mention our concern over the clamp - down on representatives of the political opposition in that country , journalists and human rights defenders , which the humanitarian organisations operating in Yemen have been speaking about for a long time .
We have been endeavouring to tackle the Roma issue for years : exploitation of minors , begging , racketeering , robbery and other pathological phenomena .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . - ( FR ) I shall conclude , Madam President , by thanking all the rapporteurs and especially Catherine Trautmann , who has done a tremendous job , as a result of which we can expect a very large majority tomorrow .
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Haug on the draft general budget of the European Union for 2009 and amending letter 1/2009 to the preliminary draft general budget ( PDB ) of the European Union .
Work continues on the directive on violence against women , yet at the same time , there are countries in the European Union , including Poland , unfortunately , which allow themselves to use legally - sanctioned violence against women in the field of sexual and reproductive health .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , with the EU - Korea Free Trade Agreement signed in October 2010 , which has been assigned the attribute by the Commission and the Council of being the most ambitious agreement of its kind ever to be negotiated between the EU and a highly industrialised state , the bilateral protection duties are to fall by around 98 % in the next five years .
Just quieten down please .
One British supermarket has recently announced that by 2012 it intends to reduce the use of packaging by 25 % and its use of carrier bags by 33 % .
Lastly , it is important that it be a vote in favour because social dialogue must be encouraged in Europe , and this hinges on the implementation of new works councils and the development of joint actions undertaken by the European social partners as a whole , as has been the case in this matter .
rapporteur . - ( ES ) Madam President , I would like to thank all members of the Committee on Petitions , especially all the shadow rapporteurs and our Chairman , Marcin Libicki , for their cooperation and daily work on petitions .
I believe that it will win your support .
I voted for the adoption of this resolution and I regret that Parliament was unable to agree on a single motion for a resolution on this topical subject .
Romania and Bulgaria have proven their ability to adopt the necessary domestic legislation and make their borders secure .
The purpose of the directive is to lay down minimum rules to ensure workers ' health and safety by means of two instruments : rest periods and a limit on the working week .
However , in many cases , it is not possible for developing countries to do this because of their poor financial situation .
Consequently , it is important that regional strategies form part of a wider European policy .
Our group fully supports this compromise , because it is very important and obvious that the economic and social development of the EU 's outermost regions is greatly determined by their periphery , difficult climate and geography and economic dependence on a short range of goods and services .
I am thus asking you , Commissioner , to ensure that all of the elements that contribute to the quality of wine and can improve that quality - reducing yields , marketing support , careful protection of geographical indications and designations of origin - are preserved , not only within the EU , but also outside it , when it comes to major multilateral negotiations .
Secondly , the report highlights the fundamental elements of the directive 's transposition .
The European Ombudsman 's primary concern is to ensure the correct operation of the institutional bodies and organisation of the EU , boosting the confidence that citizens need to have in it .
This question should equally have been asked of the Commission in terms of initiating a new legislative proposal to tighten up the relevant legislation so that we can deal with them , but pending that my advice to any small business faced with demands from European City Guide and similar guides is simple : do not pay ; ignore them ; ignore the pressure .
The possible entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon by the end of 2009 calls for a political agreement between the Council and the European Parliament in order to ensure that the procedure for the choice of the next President of the Commission and for the nomination of the future Commission will , in any case , respect the substance of the new powers that the Treaty of Lisbon assigns to the European Parliament on this issue .
At a time when States , local communities , taxpayers and businesses are accepting financial sacrifices , the Union cannot exempt itself from this virtuous process .
He referred to a remark by Louis Michel .
By raising public awareness about the importance of prevention and a healthy lifestyle we can eventually lower healthcare costs since it is cheaper to prevent diseases than subsequently treat them .
Therefore , the internalisation of external costs for air and noise pollution can count on our approval , provided the revenues are invested in making road transport cleaner - something that enjoys broad support .
However , the honourable Members will surely agree with me in saying that this agreement is a lot better than the protocol over data exchange that the United States and the EU have had to comply with for years .
In Strasbourg they shrug : ' What can we do ? ' - and remain silent .
What is important for the postal sector , its customers , its operators and its employees is that there is a final and unconditional date for full market opening .
- ( FR ) Madam President , Mrs Vassiliou , the storm called ' Klaus ' in German , or ' Nicolas ' in French , has devastated eight ' départements ' in my south - west France constituency , and Landes in particular , hence the main impact being on the forest .
Mr President , let me first of all thank the previous speaker for what Britain did for us so many years ago .
A strategy is needed that conforms to international conventions in order to improve assistance in the areas of information services , preparation and processing of applications and post - adoption services .

I favour this .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to express my full support for this report , the fruit of a lengthy and excellent job by our colleague Michael Cashman .

It is true that different international regulations govern the procurement practices in the space industry .
The refusal to discuss with Parliament new financial resources for the EU budget in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon , and the refusal to enter into dialogue over the multiannual financial framework , constitute sad caricatures of the once - lauded British sense of humour .
He has done an amazing job in bringing this dossier to such a successful conclusion today and , indeed , in laying the foundations for this success in his original report on patient mobility way back in June 2005 .
I also regret the rejection of proposals such as those which regarded the amount of the Recovery Plan ( 1.5 % of EU GDP ) to be insufficient to successfully tackle the current crisis , noting that the EU will lag far behind countries such as the United States and China .
There is one requirement : for these sovereignties to complement each other and , if possible , not to contradict each other .
There is a need , not just for simplification , but also for an improved system for companies to access this financing .
The process is inevitable if the international community , including Arab countries , does not promote the viability of one side and the security of the other as the objective of the peace process in the Middle East .
It is particularly appropriate that the Hungarian Presidency has chosen as its motto ' strong Europe ' .
The joint debate is closed .
Have no doubt about it : this is our sole objective and our task here today .
We believe that this can be better achieved if Parliament closely monitors the application of the new instrument from the outset , which is why we called for this own - initiative report .
Until October , the Coordination Cell will continue to play its supporting role towards the Member States to try to improve the security conditions in the area .

( NL ) Mr President , sustainability is a key concept in the Green Paper , and rightly so : sustainable in the sense of being both future - proof for fisheries and good for the environment .
Of course , organised crime will be included in this .

The new approach proposed in the strategy will make it possible to minimise the risk of infectious diseases breaking out in animals .

The exceptional arrangement applies every time now .
In fact , I was speaking about what Europe should be like in five or ten years , and what direction we should be taking .
Statements by the President
Manufacturers need clear regulations and certainty .
Even the erstwhile employment guarantor , a good education , is rarely any help nowadays .
This particular priority creates scope to continue with the innovation and new green technology that will help give us the edge at a global level .
The first thing to consider , Mr Turk and Mr Almunia - and maybe you can pass this message on to Mr Verheugen - is what will be in the text of the Resolution on Climate Change at the Spring Summit .
Who closed down rural train stations , railways and maternity homes ?
A glaring example is Italy where , by the end of 2009 , the public authorities were in debt to companies to the tune of approximately EUR 60 billion , and the payment delay averaged 186 days , with extremes of 800 days .
The international community must assist the East Timorese people in these steps .
Secondly , I hope that a number of Member States will now really get on with making use of the new opportunities and will also be able to tempt other Member States to join in on the strength of their good results .
The economic dimension of the problem is obvious .
While I support the report 's objective of inviting the Commission to simplify public procurement procedures in order to save local government and enterprises from having to devote substantial amounts of time and money to strictly bureaucratic issues , I regret the wording of the second part of paragraph 9 .
It was Parliament 's intention initially to grant the Committee of European Securities Regulators ( CESR ) the power to take care of registration , but , sadly , it did not work because of the tug - of - war that will inevitably ensue between the big countries and large financial centres to attract those head offices and be able to play first fiddle there , in an attempt to get the large rating offices under their wings .
The European Commission has made clear that it will be prepared to support an interest rate reduction , and I would expect that the 27 Member States will reach a consensus regarding the reconsideration of this question .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Mrs Geoghegan - Quinn , the arrival of a container full of trainers on an island somewhere , which was received enthusiastically by the residents , has in the past made headline news .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by pointing out that I did not believe it right to give our opinion so early on with a vote on the events that took place in Laâyoune on 8 November , when we do not have all the facts at our disposal to give us the necessary hindsight and objectivity .
Regardless of these two reservations , I appeal to the Member States , the Council and the Commission , including the Czech Presidency , to urgently update the relevant European and national legislation and to ratify international agreements for effectively combating paedophilia .
I would like to acknowledge the contribution of Ireland , especially through the Irish Marine Institute , in helping to form this policy .
As stated in the communication from the Commission , this relationship can and must be a driving force for developing dialogue with Mercosur .
I am therefore against the tabled report .
It could be a lobbyist for nature , a lobbyist for business , the local authorities or the national government .
I hope that just as in the case of the long - awaited revision of the constitution , which was at last carried out , it will soon also be possible to amend other legislation which clearly discriminates against Pakistan 's minorities .
MEPs need to have comprehensive information about the resources and materials available to them in order to perform their work responsibly and efficiently .
The referee makes a decision here .
It is anything but workable , Mr Simpson .
Not so long ago , the European Union witnessed cyber attacks against public and private organisations in Estonia and in Lithuania , in 2007 and 2008 respectively .
Open the debate .
The answer can always be found by asking : who benefits from intransparency ?
I want to see the people of Gaza with a future , but I also want to see Gilad Shalit , captive for years in Gaza , given the chance to go home to his mother and father whom I have already met .
There are many of us , therefore , who will not vote for this Commission , and that does not make us anti - Europeans . We are simply doing what our voters - many million European citizens - expect of us .
The EUR 549 946 will offer some assistance to them in being reintegrated into the labour market .
The employment offers no security .
At the same time , I would like to point out that the political dialogue between the EU and Belarus must be conditional on , and directly connected to , the lifting of restrictions on freedoms and cessation of the repression of participants in peaceful demonstrations and human rights activists .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - I agree entirely with that .
I consider this to be a clear rejection of the attempts by provocateurs and conspirators at speculating about the status quo .
The new directive should be a stimulus to the development of new ways of creating jobs .
I am very concerned about this , Mr President , and for this reason I am raising it in Parliament right now , hoping that Athens will both send me a proper reply and deliver a full and fair review of the case of Mr Zafiropoulos .
The next item is the report by Mr Berlato , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 1782/2003 as regards the transfer of tobacco aid to the Community Tobacco Fund for the years 2008 and 2009 and Regulation ( EC ) No 1234/2007 with regard to financing of the Community Tobacco Fund - C 6-0062/2008 - .
To this end , I think it desirable that the proposal should apply not only to third - country fishing vessels but also to those flying the Community flag , in order to adopt non - discriminatory measures and introduce a common policy within the European Union .
It is clear , but it must be stated , that the proposal in relation to the present Eurovignette Directive constitutes an amendment that will allow external costs to be internalised within the scope of the current Directive .
By the way , I am also convinced that big companies do not need the internal market as much as smaller companies do .
Without going into all the details once more , I am convinced that the initial 1996 ban on the inhaler was not legitimately imposed .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking all those who have contributed to my report - I am very grateful for their help .
Let me conclude by confirming that the Commission recognises that Europe 's landscape is the result of a long process of human intervention .

He told me : ' you are from Vorarlberg , go across the border , to Liechtenstein or Switzerland ! '
Much work still lies ahead , but EU legislation is the right way forward and gives us hope that the future will be free of hazards from everyday items and that neither we nor our children will be threatened by them .
If we look around and summarise what the Member States have done , there is only one Member State that has achieved 1.5 % , and that is Germany , which was not initially the country on the front line when it came to taking action .
Values such as the environment , social guarantees and , at the end of the day , democratic institutions .
We share this vision and we are glad that your report refers to a number of significant initiatives taken at European Union level , such as the European Year of Creativity and Innovation .
I believe we must therefore also call for protection of the specific interests of local communities .
( PL ) Mr President , at the last EU - Russia Summit , the parties signed a memorandum on the principles of an early warning mechanism on energy matters .
( SK ) Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Rivasi for an exhaustive report .
The International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the governments of many countries know that food shortages threaten the biological security of peoples .
For this reason , we are voting against the draft amendments , which open the way for insecurity by advocating savings in Parliament .
I decided to speak because some new issues have come up in the last few years .
Apart from the threat of accident or terrorist attack , there is also considerable evidence of adverse health effects along Ireland 's eastern seaboard attributed to Sellafield discharges .

You say this because compared with the situation of the American economy , yes , our economy is fundamentally much sounder .
( PL ) Today 's debate on economic governance in the European Union is a fundamental discussion , because it concerns the matter of continuing to strengthen European integration .
I wish you a very warm welcome !
In view of the frequency of earthquakes in Europe , the number of victims and the material damage involved , it is highly unlikely that resources from a solidarity fund to assist the victims of earthquakes would be used only once .
People want a European Bill of Rights just like in the federal United States .
For this reason , we have to support a UN - led solution that is as prompt and peaceful as possible .
The hypocrisy of this approach is clear , particularly when the ' European family ' of so - called ' democratic nations ' does not have a single word of condemnation for the genuine massacre perpetrated by the Israeli army against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip or for the CIA 's criminal flights , in which it was , for that matter , complicit .
The subject areas touched on in it are extremely important in terms of ensuring that the Cotonou Agreement remains the basis for a solid partnership with the ACP countries , as well as a relevant instrument against the backdrop of the new challenges which these countries are facing .
You should decide what you want to do .

My colleague Péter Olajos has mentioned that ground level has shrunk back by four metres in Homokhátság , between the Danube and the Tisza , in the last four decades . Desertification has now reached Hungary and Central Europe .
In that respect I would have perhaps expected to see more of a theme emerging with regard to the need for what I would call financial security for our citizens in a world where we know there is financial turbulence at the moment and where people feel uncertain about the future - perhaps more of a theme in that respect .
It may be that the Commission and the Council will decide to freeze derivatives , at least to propose it at world level , and to suspend trading in these commodities .
We have had experiences in the past of commodity boards .
The EU Member States have not adopted any such charter .
( NL ) Mr Füle , welcome to the House !
One of the Presidency 's objectives is actually to reach an agreement on EU aid for trade strategy at October 's General Affairs and External Relations Council , including an outline of the specific steps envisaged for attaining the EUR 2 billion agreed for trade - related assistance by 2010 , notably the EUR 1 billion from the Member States to meet the needs identified by the developing countries .
This also applies to current threats such as organised crime , terrorism , cyber threats , human and drug trafficking , energy security , as well as activities relating to early warning mechanisms and conflict prevention and resolution .

The first two reactors are already operating safely and efficiently .
I am pleased that the Czech Republic , Finland , France and others are taking a realistic approach to the issue . This is in contrast to countries where nuclear energy has become a pawn in pre - election battles to an extent that is almost unethical , bearing in mind the situation in Japan .
As a brand name is associated with perceived quality , this practice could result in misleading the public .
Last , but by no means least , we have a capacity to determine the number of hives that are out there .
However , it was envisaged , under this Amendment 86 , that this provision would be changed in order to let you decide which of the representatives of the non - attached Members should sit in the Conference of Presidents .
I strongly oppose the extension of the mandatory levy of a minimum standard VAT rate of 15 % for a further five years .
However , we do have problems with technical matters , the solution of which is growing into a political problem , as my colleague Mrs Roure said .
I have nevertheless seen fit to back some amendments modifying the initial draft , particularly those relating to 2011 as the date for the scheme 's entry into force .
We must ensure that the organised people traffickers do not have the opportunity to make billions of euro in profit out of people 's fates as a result of our right of asylum .
Subject : European funding for the Turkish army in Cyprus
There is no doubt that this fact is of fundamental importance for security in Europe , as Russia possesses the greatest conventional armed forces potential on our continent .
In my view , that target is still valid , and we should strive to reach it - particularly in those countries and regions where progress towards its achievement has been very limited , for example , in Africa .
As you know , the human rights issue was raised and discussed at the very recent summit meeting in Beijing and the joint statement also explicitly refers to it .
I support the proposal that Bulgaria and Romania should inform the European Parliament and the Council , in writing in the course of a six - month period , of further action that they intend to take as regards recommendations , submitted in assessment reports and mentioned in subsequent reports , which have yet to be implemented .
Political parties should put an end to the boycott of the national parliament , and enter a dialogue with the institutions .
For several years I have been saying here in the European Parliament that the situation in the Indian Ocean , the situation off the coast of Somalia for European fishermen and for vessels that operate and work there is unsustainable , and there has not been a great deal of response .
I believe that the defence of human rights is one of the crucial objectives that any democratic State and any democratic organisation such as the European Union must pursue .
' Two sides ' also means that enhancing transparency will only be effective if it is accompanied by due diligence , and not undone again by excessive disclaimers .
in writing . - I fully support the resolution dealing with the tragic situation in Burma .
We support the Commission approach , and that of Commissioner Füle in particular .
The change is necessary , as our role as the UN 's biggest provider of finance , one that has largely gone unnoticed , has shown .
It is important to say that the various horror scenarios which were spread at the time regarding the consequences of increased mobility have proved to be false .
Polluters must pay .
The situation of human rights within the European Union is by no means satisfactory , and the annual report by Amnesty International says as much .
There must be a deadline for negotiations to be successfully completed and someone meanwhile should offer Mugabe a retirement home .
They include the emphasis placed on the environmental debt of the countries of the North in relation to those of the South and the request for additional aid in this area .
While welcoming the sentiments on dealing with poverty expressed in the Commission 's package , what we are really looking for is concrete action .
At the very beginning we , as representatives of Lithuania and representatives of other countries , suggested that these issues be dealt with on behalf and at the level of Parliament and the Council .
This issue does not just concern progress made in equal opportunities and non - discrimination in terms of employment and working conditions ; the central issue is the need for a horizontal directive on equal treatment which covers all grounds for discrimination .
I bid you all a warm welcome .
This sets a new record for absurdly detailed regulation .
Although we have a single set of provisions , their practical implementation varies widely from one airport to another , and this creates problems and annoyance .
It is clear , therefore , that we in Europe are not ready for this and that therefore our trains will be unable , or insufficiently able , to communicate with these new signalling installations .
We began talking about Tunisia on 10 January and I put out statements on Egypt last week .
If that proposal is not lawful , the Committee on Legal Affairs will tell us .
It is easy for us to talk , but very hard to take effective action .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , after yesterday 's debate in the House , it has become apparent that a large majority would actually be in favour of our replacing the word ' could ' with the phrase ' should in any case ' .
Our respective services have also had a lot of contact and cooperation .
I consider that allowing duty free shops to continue to trade on land borders would be a solution which is also in keeping with the Commission 's own proposals , while controlling their modus operandi and stamping out cases of tax evasion would , as with all other shops , be the responsibility of the ports and airports .
Perhaps it was to benefit some states more than others ?
It also did not do so in order to gain political return from this condemnation .
The relevant TFTP agreement was approved by Parliament in July 2010 .
Use of specially trained units , like the Polish Search and Rescue Group of the National Fire Service , which holds UN certification , should be taken into account .
Mr President , in view of what we have just been speaking about , I would like to say that security in this building has been stepped up and I wish to extend our thanks to the men and women who protect us .
( LT ) I will take this opportunity to speak about the EU diplomatic mission in Belarus .
The Union is India 's main economic partner , but there is still scope for our companies to improve their position in those sectors of the Indian economy that are undergoing dynamic development .
Of course , Member States have a fundamental responsibility here to restructure budgets , giving priority to social security and investments in growth at the same time as deficits are reduced .
Today millions of people are working illegally .
( PL ) Mr President , we are debating an important report concerning the financing of the common agricultural policy .
I voted in favour of this document , because it is crucial for more effective provision of humanitarian aid .
These policies must be supported by an appropriate budget , but also by reliable checks on the programmes implemented , with suitable follow - ups and the identification of good practices .
So far in the EU there are no national definitions and there is no data collection , so we have no idea of the scale of this problem .
If we agree to this kind of law in Europe , how are we going to have discussions with Mr Lukashenko ?
I expect the Member States to respect that .
At a time when reunified Europe is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall , EU - Russia relations take on particular importance and deserve careful consideration .
Since their accession to the EU , in 2007 , both Bulgaria and Romania have had a legitimate expectation that their citizens would become fully fledged EU citizens and that they would be able to enjoy the same rights as other EU citizens , including freedom of movement within the Schengen area .
SMEs are the driving force of our economies - they should not be punished for mismanagement in the financial sector .
Indeed , the financial system has generated substantial profits from speculative transactions , and it does not have to pay any tax .
Biogas can also be used to help make farms and areas more self - sufficient in energy , and just a small part of this resource has actually been tapped .
Secondly , on 31 October , and for the first time in two years , an opposition demonstration was held in Triumph Square in Moscow without the police intervening .
Without adequate resources , none of these problems will be properly dealt with , beginning with the introduction of the intermediate category in cohesion policy , which only makes sense if it does not harm the other categories already in place .
The funds are distributed for EU projects and policies in all Member States , admittedly , in varying proportions .
In connection with the military conflict which took place in Georgia a year ago , we are monitoring with great unease the situation in South Ossetia in particular .
I believe that it is extremely important to use appropriate political wisdom , courage and mutual good will to solve these issues , not only on the part of these candidate countries , but also on the part of the Member States of the European Union .
5 .
I also hope that support will be provided to tackle the housing crisis faced by our fellow citizens , which often reaches alarming levels , particularly in the great conurbations .
I would like to build on that beautiful thought by saying that until recently we could only listen to what the candidates and thereafter new members of the European Union expected from it .
That is why I thank you most sincerely , and that is also why I , in turn , will listen to you very carefully .
I wish to express my personal sympathy to all those that are suffering as a consequence of the disaster .
We are very much relying on Parliament 's contribution to this effort in order to strengthen and enhance the solidarity of the people of the European Union and of the other Union players in this area , notably the NGOs .
Voluntary activity cannot be separated from European working life and is seen as a basic tenet of democracy at both local and public level .

This should make for a more efficient procedure and bring clear benefits for both employers and third - country nationals who want to immigrate to the territory of the Member States .
We all want to preserve our identities and how we feel about ourselves , and we need to do that .
For example , the criteria for selecting best - practice projects could be the quality and sustainability of the projects , the driving force for the regions and for the European Union , the effective use of resources and , of course , transferability to other regions .
Communication of Council common positions : see Minutes
Certain dishonest civil servants are enriching themselves from funds earmarked for training and reskilling .
I am therefore certain that this report represents Parliament 's opinion as to how we can help forests , how we can help our communities to adapt to climate change .
However , there could still be certain preventive instruments .
For this reason , I am sympathetic to the European Commission 's proposal .
Again , it is the Member States that are on the front line , to the detriment of the European unity that we require in this area .
There is another important sentence which is also to be found towards the end of the document .
This new framework agreement on relations may potentially consolidate the achievements of the Treaty of Lisbon and this could represent a significant breakthrough .
Single application procedure for residence and work (
The truth is important , but it will not deliver gas .
The language law creates an imbalance .
It also enjoys broad support from all the political groups .
Importers , holidaymakers and consumers must all be aware of their responsibility in this respect .
In October 2008 , the government of the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia filed an application for Community financing for Corridor 10 , which crosses its territory .
Firstly , as part of our policy on the integrated management of the external borders , there is a reinforcement of Frontex in the budget , as already decided , in 2008 , by the budget authority .
An initiative will only be successful if it is easily implemented and accessible to all .

During the last 50 years or so , tens of millions of inhabitants of Europe have not been born because pregnancies ended in artificial abortions .
In the fight against terrorism , it is important to respect human rights not only as a matter of principle , but also to counter radicalisation around the world .
As I stressed everywhere , progress on the path to the EU depends on the commitment to reform at home .
In the near future , this means jointly ensuring the conduct of free , fair and transparent local elections .
( FR ) Mr President , as spokesperson for the majority French party , the UMP , I congratulate the Portuguese Presidency and I am delighted with this agreement on the text of the Treaty .
This is a very big problem - not only for Third World countries , but also within the European Union , as there is a very serious brain drain from the east to the west .
We must endeavour to provide common rules , to set limits beyond which information is no longer considered to be independent .
We would also like to highlight the Commission 's proposal to evaluate the Small Business Act by the end of 2010 , so as to make life easier for these companies , especially by simplifying bureaucratic and tax matters , and placing greater emphasis on social responsibility .
European broadband - Investing in digitally driven growth (
In fact , it could be said that something did change : President Berlusconi signed an agreement with Colonel Gaddafi in spite of the fact that Colonel Gaddafi was not complying with international law and expelled the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees knowing that he had 9 000 refugees in Libya ; the same Libya that is currently being bombed after a humanitarian appeal .
The statutory radio of the Slovak Republic is bound by law to broadcast in national minority languages .
However , doing more and doing better is not just a case of increasing resources .
The contracting parties adopted amendments to it at NAFO annual meetings in 2007 and 2008 .
26 .
There is no doubt that EUR 90 million is too little to ensure proper functioning of the scheme .
We have a long way to go in this regard .
A total of EUR 33 million has been approved since 2000 , but to this day , not a single euro has been used .
The detailed modalities have yet to be clarified .
That is doubtless true !
What you said could be an example of good practice , but I cannot state that here as a representative of the Council .
They are legitimate concerns of the international community , a fact which is underlined by the existence of instruments of international law for the protection of human rights for over half a century .
The directive will not apply to weapons and ammunition collectors , to public services or to cultural and historical institutions .
Increased co - ownership is also essential .
I understand that General Motors has yet to discuss this plan with the workers ' representatives , who are expected to make commitments in order to allow significant cost reductions to be made in Europe .
There is also plenty of evidence of the need for future restrictions .
Underlying discourses on European party regulation is a deeper concern of how to co - constitute a transnational civic space composed of free and equal citizens , and what a collective founding , in the form of a ' civic contract ' among diverse peoples , might entail for the future of integration .
One important element will be flexibility in the programming process , so that funding and priorities can adapt to today 's rapidly changing world .
We also discussed at length the need to deepen internal market reform in the annual growth survey .
There are two prominent representatives of the opposition here - Mr Kazulin and Mr Milinkevich .
According to the Commission 's official statistics , unemployment reached 4.7 % in 2007 , with long - term unemployment standing at 2.8 % .

The financing instrument for development cooperation ( DCI ) improves the European Union 's previous development cooperation framework by combining the various geographical and thematic instruments into a single instrument .
The G 20 Summit in Washington in November 2008 was precisely the result of those joint efforts .
Abolishing the visa requirement for Serbia , Montenegro and Macedonia is very much to be welcomed , as the Commission 's recommendation follows careful evaluation and the meeting of requirements set .
It is good that you have attempted today to present a road map .
I doubt whether a brutal regime which does not hesitate to dispense with the lives of 156 of its citizens and is responsible for so many other atrocities will be moved by such a disproportionately small sanction on that issue .
Obviously not !
However , this is just one side of the story .
I believe therefore that the priorities for EU action should be the identification of Union - wide legal instruments , the possibility to make use of free support , the creation of refuges capable of providing psychological and moral assistance and the creation of a single emergency number throughout Europe .
Today 's debate has focused largely on the party closure and rightly so .
The fact is that the national government of each Member State also has a role here as regards imposing the requirements and conditions for strengthening the single currency , and moving this project of monetary and economic integration forward .
As we have underlined several times , enlargement reinforces peace , democracy and stability in Europe , serves the European Union 's strategic interests and helps the EU to better achieve its policy objectives in important areas which are key to economic recovery and sustainable growth .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
More so than in previous years , I have therefore done my best to ensure that the tone of the report is very objective and constructive .
Faced with the disastrous consequences of this path , instead of retracing its steps , the EU continues to show signs of wanting to rush blindly ahead .
We have therefore all been given the opportunity , under the French Presidency , to open this debate and to try to reconcile our positions ; this is what the Commission likewise hopes to achieve .
Therefore , I would again like to thank Mrs Lucas , and of course I would like to thank the author of the question , Mr Markov .
These complaints submitted by EU citizens constitute an important source of information on possible infringements of EU law .
I welcome the reference in the report 's explanatory statement to the fact that the Chinese scramble in Africa is reaping African national resources for Chinese profit and undermining sustainable development .
There is a balance to be had between liberal market conditions and issues of the needs of developing countries and it is absolutely necessary that we continue to debate this issue time and time again .
However , I think that Mr Gauzès and his friends have done a good job .
We have now managed successfully to injure a Serbia trying to forget Milošević and build a democratic future .
Opening of the sitting
We should reject it on moral grounds in the name of respect for animals , but also in the name of our own humanity .
Action aimed at increasing the number of transplants performed is particularly important .
In addition , it is important that the directive is neutral in technological terms , in that it should not specifically encourage the use of any particular fuel or technology .
For that , you have a crucial role to play in ensuring the successful implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy .
As far as his approach is concerned , I consider his actions to be the responsible actions of a statesman who , as long as he felt a measure of legal uncertainty , waited for the opinion of the relevant institution , which was the court .
( DA ) Madam President , I would like to address the Danes in particular .
They came from the chemical and steel industries and airports .
As regards the problem of development and humanitarian action , it is true that so much still remains to be done in South Sudan and that we must continue to develop the North and , most importantly , not to isolate it .
( The President : ' On Coelho ' )
In 2010 , the Commission published the Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System ( GNSS ) Applications .
My last remark concerns the comments made by Mr Bowis in relation to the toxic effects of the alternatives .
For my constituents , less than a year on , that rings very hollow indeed .
Cohesion policy is an expression of solidarity between European regions .
The rapporteur is clear , however .
We maintain that the current definition leads to ambiguity and a risk of unpredictability and bad practice .
Our report firmly states that convergence on different levels is a prior condition for long - term competitiveness in the regions , and that in years to come complementarity of the two policies will be necessary to reconcile effectiveness and solidarity .
It is also the region with the highest prevalence of deaths resulting from HIV infection , the prevalence rate in the adult population exceeding 15 % in several countries .
Similarly , we cannot allow Russia simply to behave as if last summer 's war in Georgia did not happen .
Our condemnation of the attacks is fair and necessary , but insufficient : the principle of reciprocity does not appear in this resolution .
For this reason the Commission should proceed with a territorial impact assessment of sectorial policies to enhance an effective EU Urban Agenda .
Could I say to Sinn Féin in particular : can they not acknowledge the role of the European Union in peace in Northern Ireland ?
The Slovenian Presidency is usually very helpful , but unfortunately today 's situation is such that you are right to complain .

Young people who support the opposition are being conscripted into the army .
Our group has no problem in supporting the wish for an Arctic treaty , but more in the light of a quest for a new mode of governance .
For example , in this case , at our request , an evaluation study was carried out at the end of 2005 by an independent external consultant , whose recommendations in terms of management and conservation of resources have been taken into account , together with the scientific advice provided by Guinea - Bissau 's Research Institute following the 2006 trawling campaign .
In order to provide the prospect of a better life and future , a public network of crèches and nursery schools needs to be created , covering a wider geographic area and more open to models of teaching that encourage the development of the child and of society , and that combat social segregation and discrimination .
We also suggest that the cultural and creative sector at large should set up a platform on the cultural and creative industries and one on the access to culture , along the lines of the existing platform on intercultural dialogue .
It is especially difficult when we see no signs , at this moment , of Iran signing a contract to build a nuclear power plant apart from what they have done with the Russians in Bushehr , for which the Russians have supplied the fuel .
For its part , the European Union granted financial assistance as part of the Accession Treaty , restricted to the 2007-2009 period only , with the aim of supporting decommissioning and dealing with the consequences of closing the units early .
In fact , the European Commission foresaw a continued increase in unemployment and a large deterioration in public finances for Spain in the next few years , and this year it is very probable that we will see a reduction in bank credit for families and businesses .
Forwarding of texts adopted during the sitting : see Minutes
It worked very well , but it is obvious that it worked well because in those three countries we had the support of their governments , because without such support on this issue it is extremely difficult .
My question is this : does the Commission intend to provide individual Member States with tools that they can use to prevent such large - scale social security fraud ?
It is therefore important that leaders in the G 20 Seoul Summit last week very clearly and strongly committed themselves to abstain from competitive devaluations of their currencies .
This has improved our shared knowledge and monitoring of the epidemiological situation .
I wonder why Parliament is always ready to take a stand against countries that violate laws but does not acknowledge that there is a country among the 27 Member States that is violating laws .
We are working together with the Member States in a joint EU programming exercise to maximise the impact on the ground .
The EU should take responsibility when it comes to global warming , which manifests itself very much in the form of temperature increases .
One further point : the European Union would like to conclude free trade agreements , which also apply to foreign investments , with countries like China , Korea , India and the ASEAN and ACP countries .
We need to draw a distinction here in order to be fair and honest .
That which has been achieved must now be defended , and I hope that the comprehensive reform of the European Union can now enter into force .
With the instruments of the Treaty of Lisbon , it will be simpler to create this common policy , but it is also necessary for us , as Member States , to have a genuine will to create such a united policy and not to continue prioritising bilateral channels with Moscow , which are , at times , openly divergent from each other .
The situation is especially bad close to the border between Mexico and the United States of America .
This has been a joint and collaborative exercise and I am extraordinarily grateful to all of you for the work that has gone on .
Aside from the other important aspects considered in this respect , including certain technical aspects , the fundamental aim of this directive is to remove all obstacles to the movement of ' Community trains ' .

In actual fact , it all boils down to the good faith and good will of tour operators and travel agents .
Honourable Members , I should like to begin by thanking , even if he is not present , the honourable Member who tabled this question for his interest in this matter .
They have played their part in making possible the success that we have achieved and for that I ask that we thank them .
It is also pleasing to see the integration of the proposed 65 new posts into the estimates for 2009 with the idea of strengthening Parliament 's legislative activity and services to Members , while at the same time placing 15 % of those appropriations in reserve .
It is alarming to learn that implementation of the Small Business Act is coming up against many obstacles in the Member States , although the examples of several countries show that following these principles yields good results .
But if the latter is true and no action is taken , then citizens will be frustrated and angry .
Similarly , you said you would not criminalise individuals for downloading from the Internet , but then you talked about the external borders of the Community and what might happen with people going away rather than coming into the EU , so again , we do not want anything in ACTA which criminalises anyone for individual use .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , I think we are all agreed on the importance of tourism .
Thus it is not a question of penalising ; you should not reward products that are not healthy by giving them a lower VAT rating .
This budget is not even extravagant .
Firstly , I would like to encourage them to reconsider the importance of Russian energy imports and , secondly , to extend the Partnership Agreement in a way that EU representatives could participate as observers in the elections to be held in December this year and in the Presidential elections to be held in March 2013 .

No less important is the acknowledgement of Georgia 's and Ukraine 's transatlantic aspirations .
Just like me , at the beginning of this term of office , you had the option of choosing from which coffers your daily allowances would be paid : from the UK coffers or from those of the European Union .
My report deals with numerous deficiencies and puts forward proposals in the hope that the Commission will perhaps be able to include some of them in its legislative proposal that it will be tabling in the autumn .
For this reason every citizen of the Union must comply with the laws of the Union ; as Commissioner Frattini said just now , freedom of movement does not mean freedom of crime without borders .
The agriculture sector 's susceptibility to market instability and price volatility must be addressed and the CAP should guarantee a safety - mechanism and provision for effective risk prevention , which would give farmers a measure of income security in these economically trying times and serve to provide foresight of how global price volatility will affect developing countries .
We Hungarians belong to a relatively small nation , but we are proud to have 50 Nobel Prize winners , mostly in the natural sciences .
It also recommends that prison staff should be trained in , and made more aware of , this issue .
( DE ) Madam President , the ink is barely dry on the abortive Treaty of Lisbon and already the next amendments have been tabled , and the chaos surrounding our new Members - people are talking about phantom Members - is truly perfect .
The scientific information cannot be disputed .
The changes to the global situation regarding the production , trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs is worrying .
The budget is not intended for this purpose and this would not be possible either in political or legal terms .

I think it is fair to recognise that , although serious concerns remain and need to be addressed , China has also made remarkable progress in the human rights field over the last year .
( SL ) Thank you very much , Mr President .
I hope that the Commission undertakes , through this now imminent measure , to defend life in the Mediterranean against the attacks of multinationals and governments who are complicit and care little about our collective welfare .

The United States ' bioethanol programme contributed significantly to sending food prices soaring in 2008 ; based on those experiences , the European Union must re - examine its earlier commitments with regard to biofuel ratios .
We also saw the huge progress which has been made by the government of Prime Minister Filat on the road to European integration and the many reforms , including significant progress in the fight against corruption which had previously been eating away at the country .
It is also important that Africa understands its power in the international arena .
I recognise the need for this as well .
On the whole , I agree with the proposed amendments , given that the introduction of alien species is one of the main reasons why ecosystems are being thrown out of kilter and , along with the destruction of natural habitats , one of the biggest contributory factors implicated in global biodiversity loss , as is acknowledged by the Commission .
Mrs Ross was the candidate selected by the Board of Supervisors of the European Banking Authority ( European Securities and Markets Authority ) and was heard , in accordance with the established procedures , by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
The fact that the African Union has suspended the country 's membership , declaring the political regime illegal , along with the suspension of assistance by the IMF and the World Bank , have led to the government 's international isolation and deepened the problems of a population deprived of foreign aid .
What I am in favour of , though , is active EU policy to guarantee the independence of countries like Ukraine , Georgia and Moldova , and I hope that the proposals which the Commission will be moving this autumn surrounding eastern partnership will help strengthen the ties with the said neighbouring countries , so that we can help them to guarantee their own development and their own independence .
Wednesday :
Sadly , they will not go to Paris or Frankfurt , but instead further afield : to New York and Singapore .

I come to the important question of geographical indications and traditional specialities .
We not only have a crisis or many building sites , we also have an opportunity .
SEPA is primarily a market - driven project , but given the substantial benefits to the wider economy , the Commission has sought to encourage SEPA migration , for example by acting as a catalyst to raise the political profile of SEPA through our SEPA Progress Report and by encouraging early migration by public authorities .
I voted in favour of the motion for a joint resolution on the continuation of the informal European Council of 11 February 2010 .
Smoking is perhaps a good example of how social opposition can be generated ; in many places nowadays smoking is not - if I can put it this way - a cool or trendy thing to be doing .
The EU Pilot Evaluation Report raised a number of questions in the committee responsible , which is why the European Commission has been called on to make available the relevant data .
I commend the Serbian Government on its repeated commitment to refrain from the use of violence .
I attended a seminar a few weeks ago in Brussels which described new technology developed to get rare elements from the seabed .
We have to treat Russia as it is and not Russia as we wish it to be .
in writing . - ( RO ) Given that the current regulations for settling disputes rely on a diplomatic approach and can easily be blocked by the party which is failing to fulfil its obligations , I think that adopting this agreement will improve the security and predictability of trade relations between the European Union and Morocco , making it beneficial to both companies and consumers .
Nevertheless , our group strongly opposes the extensive introduction of biometrics .
It is important because the area to the East of the borders of the EU offers business opportunities which are irreplaceable in terms of maintaining the competitiveness of the Union in the coming decades .

In the report we also emphasise the fact that the recovery plan will have important consequences for the fishing industry as well as the economic and social development of local communities , and this is why the Commission should reconsider the fishing effort system once cod stocks have significantly improved .
It must be said at the start that both the Republic of Congo and Cameroon have highly repressive governments .
I am keen to remind you - it was not mentioned during the speeches - that the problem of competitiveness is a fundamental one .
In this regard , I sincerely hope that our words are followed by actions .
Last week an RTE television programme ( which I once edited and presented ) asked the very simple question , ' How many inspectors does it take to examine a farm ? '
